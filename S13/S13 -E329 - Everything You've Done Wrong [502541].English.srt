I AM MANY THINGS, CLARE,

349
00:13:41,655 --> 00:13:44,658
BUT AN ACTRESS
IS NOT ONE OF THEM.

350
00:13:44,741 --> 00:13:46,535
THIS IS A TERRIBLE IDEA,
ISN'T IT?

351
00:13:46,618 --> 00:13:47,619
WHAT, GETTING ME
TO CALL THE PUBLISHER

352
00:13:47,703 --> 00:13:49,079
PRETENDING TO BE ZOE,

353
00:13:49,162 --> 00:13:49,746
TO CORROBORATE THE LIES
YOU WROTE

354
00:13:49,830 --> 00:13:51,582
AND PASSED OFF AS TRUE?

355
00:13:51,665 --> 00:13:52,875
NO, NO, NO,
IT'S A GREAT PLAN.

356
00:13:52,958 --> 00:13:54,585
WHAT COULD POSSIBLY
GO WRONG?

357
00:13:54,668 --> 00:13:56,086
YOU'RE MAKING FUN OF ME.

358
00:13:56,170 --> 00:14:00,257
I JUST THINK YOU SHOULD
COME CLEAN.

359
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:01,466
MY BRAIN COULD BE USELESS
FOR MONTHS!

360
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:03,343

WILL BE LIKE THIS TERM?

362
00:14:05,137 --> 00:14:07,181
I COULD BOMB EVERY CLASS!

363
00:14:07,264 --> 00:14:08,807
SO WHAT'RE YOU GONNA DO?

364
00:14:08,891 --> 00:14:11,226
I'LL FIGURE SOMETHING OUT.

365
00:14:11,310 --> 00:14:13,020
'CAUSE YOU'RE SO GOOD
AT THAT RIGHT NOW.

366
00:14:13,103 --> 00:14:14,605

LYING GOT ME INTO THIS.

369
00:14:18,984 --> 00:14:21,945

IT'S GONNA GET ME OUT.

CAN I TALK TO YOU
FOR A MINUTE?

374
00:14:40,797 --> 00:14:42,883
UM, AGAIN,
I'M SO SORRY ABOUT BEFORE,

BRINGING ADAM UP,
I-

376
00:14:44,384 --> 00:14:46,512
YOU DON'T HAVE
TO APOLOGIZE TO ME.

377
00:14:46,595 --> 00:14:48,096

HE MISSED YOU.

381
00:14:56,396 --> 00:14:58,357
WHAT?

382
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:01,485
THAT'S WHY ADAM LEFT
TO CALL YOU.

383
00:15:01,568 --> 00:15:03,362

00:15:10,118 --> 00:15:11,328
AND I DIDN'T KNOW
IF ANYTHING-

387
00:15:11,411 --> 00:15:13,580
HE JUST WANTED TO HEAR
THE SOUND OF YOUR VOICE.

388
00:15:13,664 --> 00:15:15,165
HE WOULDN'T SHUT UP
ABOUT IT.

389
00:15:17,668 --> 00:15:19,878
HE LOVED YOU.

390
00:15:19,962 --> 00:15:22,589
HE REALLY,
REALLY LOVED YOU.

391
00:15:22,673 --> 00:15:24,174

DO YOU STILL WANT

CLARE, WE HAVE DEADLINES!
THERE'S NO TIME-

407
00:16:09,803 --> 00:16:11,305
I FABRICATED THE STORY.

00:16:19,354 --> 00:16:20,856
I DIDN'T GET ANYTHING
INTERESTING FROM ZOE,

409
00:16:20,939 --> 00:16:22,065
SO I EMBELLISHED.

410

00:16:24,484 --> 00:16:27,487
I MADE A HUGE MISTAKE.

412
00:16:27,571 --> 00:16:28,822
YOU PUT MY REPUTATION
ON THE LINE.

413
00:16:28,906 --> 00:16:30,407

414
00:16:32,743 --> 00:16:33,702

THE SUMMER

DOING AMAZING THINGS
LIKE THIS

416
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:37,748

INTO COLUMBIA...

FROM THIS.

423
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:05,025
JUST KNOW I UNDERSTAND
WHAT I DID WAS WRONG

424
00:17:05,108 --> 00:17:06,610

425
00:17:10,447 --> 00:17:12,407

LIVER FLUSH CAPSULES.

ONE OF THESE PILLS

452
00:18:26,398 --> 00:18:27,816
WILL FLUSH THOSE PESKY STEROIDS
THROUGH YOUR SYSTEM

I'M OUT OF THE BIZ.

HAS COMPLETELY RUN DRY.
