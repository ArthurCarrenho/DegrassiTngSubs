ZOE:
I HAVEN'T SEEN THEM

174
00:06:13,457 --> 00:06:16,627
SINCE THE POLICE TOOK THEM
FROM SCHOOL.

175
00:06:20,756 --> 00:06:23,383

ALL RISE!

PLEASE STATE YOUR FULL NAME
FOR THE RECORD.

LUKE BAKER.

178
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:28,514
AND WHAT IS YOUR RELATIONSHIP
TO ZOE RIVAS?

179
00:06:28,597 --> 00:06:30,891
UH, ZOE AND I GO
TO THE SAME SCHOOL,

180
00:06:30,974 --> 00:06:33,685
BUT WE NEVER REALLY,
UH, TALKED.

181
00:06:33,769 --> 00:06:36,438
UNTIL THE HOLLINGSWORTH PARTY?

182
00:06:36,522 --> 00:06:38,649
LUKE:
NEIL AND I CAME ACROSS HER
IN THE POOL HOUSE.

183
00:06:38,732 --> 00:06:40,776
DANNY YEGOVAN:
WHERE YOU HOOKED UP WITH HER?

184
00:06:40,859 --> 00:06:43,028
LUKE:
UH, WE THOUGHT...

185
00:06:43,111 --> 00:06:45,906
IT WAS KINDA WEIRD THAT
SHE WANTED TO FOOL AROUND

186
00:06:45,989 --> 00:06:49,326
WITH TWO GUYS AT THE SAME TIME,
BUT...

187
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:53,705
SHE'S GOT THIS REP
AS THIS CELEBRITY PARTY GIRL.

188
00:06:53,789 --> 00:06:56,542
DANNY YEGOVAN:
SO YOU'RE CLAIMING THIS HOOK-UP
WAS CONSENSUAL?

189
00:06:56,625 --> 00:07:00,128
WELL, SHE NEVER SAID NO.

190
00:07:00,212 --> 00:07:03,674
DANNY YEGOVAN:
SO YOU DID NOT TAKE ADVANTAGE
OF ZOE'S INTOXICATED STATE

191
00:07:03,757 --> 00:07:05,259
TO ASSAULT HER?

192
00:07:05,342 --> 00:07:07,219
LUKE:
NO.

193
00:07:07,302 --> 00:07:08,136
DANNY YEGOVAN:
AND YOU DID NOT CONTINUE
TO VIOLATE HER

194
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:10,055
WHILE SHE WAS PASSED OUT?

195
00:07:10,138 --> 00:07:12,057

ABSOLUTELY NOT.

WHAT'S WITH THE FURROWED BROW?

199
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,234

AT SCHOOL.

OF THINGS ABOUT HER ONLINE.

WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING!

203
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:29,867
HOW ABOUT SOME PLACARDS?

204
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:31,785

UH, YEAH, AND T-SHIRTS?

206
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:35,789
PEOPLE COULD WEAR THEM IN COURT
TO SHOW THEIR SUPPORT.

207
00:07:35,873 --> 00:07:37,291
YEAH, WE COULD GET
OTHER STUDENTS TO HELP!

208
00:07:37,374 --> 00:07:38,083

BUNCH OF SUPPLIES

SHE WAS AFTER

216
00:07:50,512 --> 00:07:54,224
SHE WAS A LITTLE DOWN;
SHE WAS GETTING OVER A BREAKUP.

217
00:07:54,308 --> 00:07:55,684

A GOOD TIME.

DID ZOE SPECIFICALLY SAY

THAT SHE WANTED TO HOOK UP
THAT NIGHT?

223
00:08:08,947 --> 00:08:10,866
AND REMEMBER,
YOU'RE UNDER OATH.

224
00:08:10,949 --> 00:08:14,077
PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE,
DON'T SAY...

225

REALLY DRUNK AT THE TIME!

WHICH IS WHY YOU TRIED
TO STOP HER,

228
00:08:20,792 --> 00:08:23,462
BECAUSE YOU KNEW
THAT SHE'D REGRET IT.

229

JUST LIKE EARLIER THIS YEAR

OF RAPE?

DON'T WORRY, I WILL TALK
TO THE JUDGE.

00:08:54,743 --> 00:08:56,036
GIVEN THE CIRCUMSTANCES,
HE WILL FORGIVE YOUR BEHAVIOUR!

HONEY.

WHY NOT?

253
00:09:08,549 --> 00:09:10,759
BECAUSE TECHNICALLY,
THIS IS NOT YOUR CASE.

254
00:09:10,843 --> 00:09:12,469
THE PROSECUTION REPRESENTS
THE GOVERNMENT.

255

I CAN DO?

HONESTLY?

257
00:09:14,805 --> 00:09:16,640
STAY OUT OF COURT.

258
00:09:16,723 --> 00:09:19,268

MAKES ME FEEL BETTER?

00:09:38,245 --> 00:09:40,080
UH, LOOK ON THE BRIGHT SIDE:

267
00:09:40,163 --> 00:09:43,083
YOU HAVE EXTRA TIME TO FOCUS
ON YOUR AUDITION.

ABOUT ME ON THE STAND.

269

I NEED TO FIND A WAY
TO INFLUENCE THE JURY.

TO TESTIFY, RIGHT?

271

CONVINCED EVERYONE

WHAT WOULD GATSBY DO?

276
00:10:05,063 --> 00:10:07,816
HIRE A HIT MAN,
TAKE PEOPLE OUT.

277
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:10,027

SPEAK OF SEASON EIGHT.

I GUESS...

279
00:10:16,116 --> 00:10:19,077
I GUESS SHE'D FIND A WAY
TO DO SOME SERIOUS IMAGE REHAB.

280
00:10:21,288 --> 00:10:23,540

WHAT I'M THINKING?

THAT THERE ARE LIKE
A MILLION REPORTERS

I'M HERE WITH THE BEAUTIFUL,
YOUNG ZOE RIVAS.

288

THE PEOPLE TO KNOW

289
00:10:42,893 --> 00:10:44,394
ABOUT THAT TERRIBLE NIGHT?

290
00:10:46,438 --> 00:10:47,940
THE TRUTH.

291
00:10:50,359 --> 00:10:52,361
AND YOU FORGOT TO SAY,
"TALENTED!"

292
00:10:52,444 --> 00:10:53,946
(LAUGHS)

293
00:10:57,491 --> 00:10:58,825

THAT IS DEFINITELY NOT THE SPOT
FOR THE PURPLE.

MAYA:
YEAH, WELL,
YOUR HAND'S IN THE WAY

295
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:01,161
AND I CAN'T GET IT RIGHT!

296
00:11:02,829 --> 00:11:04,081

YOU'RE COLOURING
IN THE WRONG SPOT!

297
00:11:04,164 --> 00:11:06,458
HEY, UM, THANKS FOR
DOING THIS WITH ME.

298
00:11:06,542 --> 00:11:09,253
IT MEANS A LOT.

299
00:11:09,336 --> 00:11:11,046
YEAH, WELL, ZOE DIDN'T DESERVE
WHAT HAPPENED TO HER,

300
00:11:11,129 --> 00:11:11,463
AND PEOPLE NEED
TO HEAR THAT.

301
00:11:11,547 --> 00:11:14,466
YEAH.

302
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:16,927
PLUS, SPENDING TIME WITH YOU
ISN'T SO BAD.

303
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:19,304
OH NO?

304
00:11:19,388 --> 00:11:21,139
THAT'S GOOD TO HEAR.

305
00:11:21,223 --> 00:11:22,516
MAYBE WHEN THIS
IS ALL OVER,

306
00:11:22,599 --> 00:11:26,645
WE CAN LIKE SPEND
SOME MORE TIME TOGETHER.

307
00:11:26,728 --> 00:11:28,230

SWEET TALK MS. GRELL

YOU'RE WASTING YOUR TIME,
DUDE.

312
00:11:38,907 --> 00:11:39,616
MAN, WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

313
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:41,326
I TOTALLY HAVE ANOTHER SHOT.

314
00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:42,119
HOW DO YOU THINK
MAYA'S GOING TO FEEL

315
00:11:42,202 --> 00:11:44,037
WHEN YOU TESTIFY
IN COURT

316
00:11:44,121 --> 00:11:45,831
THAT YOU PRETTY MUCH
MADE OUT WITH ZOE

317
00:11:45,914 --> 00:11:48,709
WHILE YOU GUYS WERE
STILL TOGETHER?

318
00:11:51,336 --> 00:11:52,796
MR. PERINO:
OKAY, BEFORE WE HEAD OUT,

319
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:55,090
I WANT ALL YOUR CELL PHONES
IN THIS BOX!

320
00:11:55,174 --> 00:11:57,384
WE'RE USING COMPASSES TODAY,
NOT SMARTPHONES!

321
00:11:57,467 --> 00:11:58,552
THANK YOU.

THANK YOU.

IMOGEN:
HEY, STRANGER!
I DIDN'T SEE YOU ON THE BUS.

327
00:12:10,189 --> 00:12:11,440
UM, THE ONLY SEAT LEFT
WAS AT THE FRONT

328
00:12:11,523 --> 00:12:12,441
AND I RUSHED STRAIGHT
FROM COURT, SO...

329
00:12:12,524 --> 00:12:15,194
WELL, THAT EXPLAINS THE DUDS.

330
00:12:15,277 --> 00:12:16,820
WEREN'T YOU SUPPOSED TO TESTIFY
THIS AFTERNOON?

331
00:12:16,904 --> 00:12:17,905
IF I WAS,
WOULD I BE HERE?

332
00:12:17,988 --> 00:12:19,489
TRUE! PARTNERS?

333
00:12:20,824 --> 00:12:22,451
IS WHAT IMOGEN
WOULD HAVE SAID

334
00:12:22,534 --> 00:12:23,410
IF SHE HADN'T ALREADY AGREED
TO BE MINE.

335
00:12:23,493 --> 00:12:25,412
OH...

336
00:12:25,495 --> 00:12:25,996
BUT THAT'S BEFORE I KNEW
MY BESTIE WAS AVAILABLE.

337
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:27,664
NOPE, SORRY.

338
00:12:27,748 --> 00:12:29,499
THE ONLY PERSON STILL SOLO
IS DREW,

339
00:12:29,583 --> 00:12:30,709
AND I CAN'T SPEND THE WHOLE DAY
ALONE IN THE WOODS WITH HIM.

340
00:12:30,792 --> 00:12:32,044
DIDN'T YOU GUYS
LIKE KISS AND MAKE UP?!

341
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:33,670
THERE WAS NO KISSING!

342
00:12:33,754 --> 00:12:36,423
I DON'T UNDERSTAND,
DREW'S NOT EVEN THAT CUTE!

343
00:12:36,507 --> 00:12:38,592
BESIDES, I WANNA HEAR EVERYTHING

344
00:12:38,675 --> 00:12:39,927
UH, YOU KNOW WHAT?

345
00:12:40,010 --> 00:12:41,470
IT'S FINE,
I'LL GO WITH DREW.

346
00:12:41,553 --> 00:12:42,554
ARE YOU SURE?
YEAH!

347
00:12:42,638 --> 00:12:44,014
I MEAN IT'S NOT LIKE

348
00:12:44,097 --> 00:12:44,806
I'LL ACCIDENTALLY
MAKE OUT WITH HIM.

349
00:12:44,890 --> 00:12:46,391
YOU SAY THAT NOW!

350
00:12:46,475 --> 00:12:48,477

351
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,187
DREW: HEY!
BECKY: HEY.

352
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:51,104
YOU WANNA BE IN CHARGE
OF THE COMPASS?

353
00:12:51,188 --> 00:12:52,022
NOT UNLESS YOU WANT
TO GET LOST!

354
00:12:52,105 --> 00:12:54,816
I WON'T EVER
GET LOST!
OKAY. OH!

355
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:56,944

00:13:05,327 --> 00:13:07,246
RIGHT NOW, I WANT TO HEAR
YOUR STORY.

362
00:13:08,372 --> 00:13:10,249
RIGHT.

363
00:13:10,332 --> 00:13:13,377
UM, WELL...
THE MORNING AFTER,

364
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:15,546
I WOKE UP IN THE POOL HOUSE
NAKED-

365
00:13:15,629 --> 00:13:16,380
NO, NO, NO,
I CAN GET THE FACTS

366
00:13:16,463 --> 00:13:17,923
FROM THE COURT TRANSCRIPT.

367
00:13:18,006 --> 00:13:21,927
I WANT TO KNOW
WHAT YOU WERE FEELING.

368
00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:24,304
MAYBE THIS ISN'T
A GOOD IDEA.

369
00:13:24,388 --> 00:13:26,056
I HAVE TO TESTIFY
IN AN HOUR.

370
00:13:26,139 --> 00:13:28,016
PLUS, THE LAWYER
FOR THE PROSECUTION

371
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:29,268
DOESN'T WANT ME TALKING
TO THE PRESS, SO-

372
00:13:29,351 --> 00:13:30,686
THE LAWYER WHO,
ACCORDING TO YOU,

373
00:13:30,769 --> 00:13:32,271
IS "TANKING YOUR CASE."

374
00:13:34,731 --> 00:13:36,984
THOSE BOYS HURT YOU,
DIDN'T THEY?

375
00:13:39,528 --> 00:13:40,988
YES.

376
00:13:41,071 --> 00:13:42,906
THEN I NEED
THE WHOLE STORY.

377
00:13:48,871 --> 00:13:51,582
OKAY.
WHERE DO I START?

378
00:13:55,210 --> 00:13:57,129
MILES:
ALL RIGHT, T-SHIRTS AND PLACARDS
ARE LOADED.

379
00:13:57,212 --> 00:13:57,880
WE SHOULD GET GOING
IF WE WANT TO BE IN COURT

380
00:13:57,963 --> 00:13:58,755
FOR ZOE'S TESTIMONY.

381

382
00:14:01,216 --> 00:14:03,260

383
00:14:03,343 --> 00:14:05,095
MILES: UM, YEAH, OKAY.
MAYA: OKAY.

384
00:14:11,435 --> 00:14:14,021
WHAT, AM I IN TROUBLE
OR SOMETHING?

385
00:14:14,104 --> 00:14:16,356
NO, I JUST WANTED
TO TALK TO YOU.

386
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:17,816
UH, CAN IT WAIT?

387
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:20,319
IT'S JUST...
WOULD IT BE WEIRD,

388
00:14:20,402 --> 00:14:21,612
LIKE WITH US,

389
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:23,197
IF MILES AND I...

390
00:14:25,657 --> 00:14:27,284
YOU STILL LOVE HIM.

391
00:14:27,367 --> 00:14:28,577
I THINK SO.

392
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:30,245
BELIEVE IT OR NOT,

393
00:14:30,329 --> 00:14:32,664
IT IS POSSIBLE TO GET OVER
MAYA MATLIN.

394
00:14:34,208 --> 00:14:35,709
THANK YOU.

VINCE:
SHE'S PRETTY, ZIGGY!

397
00:14:52,309 --> 00:14:54,603
IS SHE THE REASON
YOU'VE BEEN IGNORING MY CALLS?

398
00:14:54,686 --> 00:14:56,980
NO, MAN, I'VE JUST BEEN
SUPER BUSY WITH...

399
00:14:57,064 --> 00:14:59,233
WITH FAMILY, SCHOOL,
AND-

400
00:14:59,316 --> 00:15:00,400
WELL PLUS, I HAVE A JOB
AT THIS RESTAURANT NOW,

401
00:15:00,484 --> 00:15:01,985
SO IT'S LIKE...

402
00:15:03,028 --> 00:15:04,947
VINCE:
I GOT A JOB FOR YOU, TOO.

403
00:15:08,116 --> 00:15:11,286
VINCE, MAN, I'M RETIRED.

404
00:15:11,370 --> 00:15:12,996
THEN YOU SHOULD'VE MOVED
TO FLORIDA.

405
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:15,666
NO ONE GETS OUT THAT EASY.

406
00:15:15,749 --> 00:15:17,042
EXAM TIME IS COMING UP

407
00:15:17,125 --> 00:15:18,877
AND I NEED MY SOLDIERS
IN THE FIELD.

408
00:15:21,505 --> 00:15:23,799
WHAT HAPPENS IF I SAY NO?

409
00:15:23,882 --> 00:15:25,634
I THINK YOU KNOW THE ANSWER
TO THAT.

410
00:15:28,554 --> 00:15:31,265
RHONDA PATTERSON:
BUT YOU DIDN'T SAY NO,
DID YOU?

411
00:15:31,348 --> 00:15:33,642
I DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING.
I WAS UNCONSCIOUS.

412
00:15:36,144 --> 00:15:36,645
WELL THEN, HOW DO YOU KNOW
THAT YOU WERE ASSAULTED

413
00:15:36,728 --> 00:15:37,980
BY THE DEFENDANTS?

414
00:15:38,063 --> 00:15:38,981
BECAUSE THE NEXT DAY
AT SCHOOL,

415
00:15:39,064 --> 00:15:41,233
EVERYBODY WAS TALKING

416
00:15:41,316 --> 00:15:43,569
AND POSTING PICTURES
OVER SOCIAL MEDIA.

417
00:15:43,652 --> 00:15:45,153
HOW DID THAT MAKE YOU FEEL?

418
00:15:47,114 --> 00:15:48,031
LIKE I WANTED TO CRAWL
INTO A CAVE

419
00:15:48,115 --> 00:15:50,200
AND NEVER COME UP.

420
00:15:50,284 --> 00:15:51,451
YOU WERE EMBARRASSED?

421
00:15:51,535 --> 00:15:53,328
OF COURSE.

422
00:15:53,412 --> 00:15:55,330
YOU DIDN'T LIKE YOUR CLASSMATES
CALLING YOU NAMES.

423
00:15:55,414 --> 00:15:56,915
WHO WOULD?!
AND YOU WANTED THEM
TO STOP?

424
00:15:56,999 --> 00:15:58,917
WELL, OBVIOUSLY!

425
00:15:59,001 --> 00:16:00,794
SO YOU TOLD EVERYONE THAT
THESE BOYS ASSAULTED YOU!

426
00:16:00,878 --> 00:16:03,297
NO! NO, THAT'S A LIE!

427
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:06,508
THEN WHY DID YOU TELL BUZZLINE:
AND I QUOTE,

428
00:16:06,592 --> 00:16:08,552
"THE WHOLE SCHOOL THOUGHT
I WAS A SLUT.

429
00:16:08,635 --> 00:16:10,012
I WANTED THEM TO STOP,

430
00:16:10,095 --> 00:16:12,931
SO I SAID THOSE BOYS
ASSAULTED ME."

431
00:16:13,015 --> 00:16:14,975
I-I DIDN'T TELL THEM THAT!

432
00:16:15,058 --> 00:16:16,977
THAT REPORTER MUST'VE
MISQUOTED ME!

433
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:18,854
RHONDA PATTERSON:
REALLY?

434
00:16:18,937 --> 00:16:19,980
WELL THEN, MAYBE THIS TRANSCRIPT
FROM "BUZZLINE"

435
00:16:20,063 --> 00:16:22,900
WILL JOG YOUR MEMORY.

436
00:16:22,983 --> 00:16:25,777
PLEASE READ THE HIGHLIGHTED
PORTIONS FOR THE COURT.

437
00:16:30,407 --> 00:16:33,035
"THE WHOLE SCHOOL THOUGHT
I WAS A SLUT.

438
00:16:33,118 --> 00:16:35,454
I WANTED THEM TO STOP,

439

SO I SAID THOSE BOYS
ASSAULTED ME."

440
00:16:42,044 --> 00:16:44,129
OKAY, I MIGHT HAVE SAID
THESE ACTUAL WORDS,

441
00:16:44,213 --> 00:16:46,632
BUT I DIDN'T WANT IT
TO SOUND LIKE THIS!

442
00:16:46,715 --> 00:16:48,967
JUST LIKE YOU DIDN'T WANT
THE KIDS AT SCHOOL

443
00:16:49,051 --> 00:16:50,219
SAYING THAT YOU HAD
HOOKED UP

444
00:16:50,302 --> 00:16:53,347
WITH TWO BOYS
AT THE SAME TIME!

445
00:16:53,430 --> 00:16:55,557

YOU DIDN'T CONSENT TO IT.

"YOU'VE HEARD OF THE BOY
WHO CRIED WOLF.

447

ALL OVER!

TRISTAN:
OKAY, BUT IT'S NOT ALL BAD.

452
00:17:12,950 --> 00:17:14,201
THE JOURNALIST DESCRIBES YOU

453
00:17:14,284 --> 00:17:17,329
AS A, "BEAUTIFUL, TALENTED,
YOUNG GIRL."

454
00:17:17,412 --> 00:17:18,956
OBSESSED WITH
MALE ATTENTION!

455
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:22,501
YEAH, BUT THAT PART
IS KIND OF TRUE!

456
00:17:22,584 --> 00:17:24,419
SO YOU AGREE
WITH THAT REPORTER?

457
00:17:24,503 --> 00:17:26,255
UH-OH.
GOD, NO, ZOE,
OF COURSE NOT!

458
00:17:26,338 --> 00:17:27,506
BUT YOU DO CARE A LOT
ABOUT WHAT BOYS THINK!

459
00:17:27,589 --> 00:17:29,007
FIRST, MY BROTHER...

460
00:17:29,091 --> 00:17:29,508
OKAY, FRANKIE,
LEAVE ME OUT OF THIS, OKAY?!

464
00:17:34,596 --> 00:17:36,139
SO YOU THINK I'M TO BLAME
FOR WHAT HAPPENED THAT NIGHT?!

465
00:17:36,223 --> 00:17:37,349
OKAY, IT DOESN'T MATTER
WHAT THEY THINK,

00:17:37,432 --> 00:17:38,684

PERINO GAVE US,

RIGHT OVER THERE.

AND BESIDES, WE HAVEN'T SEEN
ANYONE FROM OUR CLASS IN HOURS!

480
00:18:07,045 --> 00:18:08,714
OKAY, WELL,

481
00:18:08,797 --> 00:18:10,090

PERINO SAID IN CLASS?!

SUCH A BIG MISTAKE?!

WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO?

502
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:54,676
IF I DON'T LIE ON THE STAND
MY FAMILY HATES ME,

503
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:56,595

I HATE MYSELF!
