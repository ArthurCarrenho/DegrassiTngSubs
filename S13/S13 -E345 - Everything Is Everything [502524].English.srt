00:00:10,552 --> 00:00:11,261
I FINALLY GOT A HOLD
OF THE REGISTERED OWNER

00:00:11,345 --> 00:00:12,387

00:00:12,471 --> 00:00:14,848
MR. ARCHIBALD SIMPSON.

6
00:00:14,932 --> 00:00:16,725
YOUR STORY CHECKS OUT.

7
00:00:16,808 --> 00:00:18,727
OF COURSE IT DOES!

8
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:20,187
WHY COULDN'T YOU
JUST BELIEVE ME,

9
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:21,522
INSTEAD OF MAKING US WAIT
IN THIS COP SHOP ALL NIGHT?!

10
00:00:21,605 --> 00:00:24,107
YOU ARE FREE TO GO.

11
00:00:24,191 --> 00:00:26,276
THE CAR WAS TOWED
TO THAT LOT.

12
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:27,528
HOW ARE WE SUPPOSED
TO GET THERE?

13
00:00:27,611 --> 00:00:29,071
I DON'T KNOW, CAB? BUS?

14
00:00:29,154 --> 00:00:31,281
PERFECT.

15
00:00:31,365 --> 00:00:33,909

00:00:38,705 --> 00:00:40,624
IT COULD'VE BEEN WORSE.
HOW?

18
00:00:40,707 --> 00:00:42,209
YOU WERE A LITTLE
BELLIGERENT!

19
00:00:42,292 --> 00:00:44,253
BECAUSE WE GOT PULLED OVER
FOR "DRIVING WHILE BLACK."

20
00:00:44,336 --> 00:00:45,879
THAT ISN'T SUPPOSED
TO HAPPEN, CONNOR!

00:00:45,963 --> 00:00:47,047
LET'S JUST GET
THE CAR BACK.

22
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:49,091
ALLI'LL BE WONDERING
WHAT HAPPENED.

23
00:00:49,174 --> 00:00:50,092
WE CAN'T TELL HER
ABOUT ANY OF THIS.

24
00:00:50,175 --> 00:00:52,219
WHY?

25
00:00:52,302 --> 00:00:54,221
BECAUSE I DON'T WANT
TO RUIN HER DAY.

26
00:00:54,304 --> 00:00:56,348
SHE WON'T UNDERSTAND
WHAT WE'VE BEEN THROUGH.

I'M NOT REALLY GOOD
AT LYING.

SO DID DREW MENTION
THAT I WAS THE ONE

107
00:03:40,596 --> 00:03:42,347
WHO SET UP
HIS TEEN PERSONALS PROFILE;

108
00:03:42,431 --> 00:03:43,599
THAT I WAS THE ONE
WHO PICKED YOU OUT?

139
00:04:49,915 --> 00:04:51,667
AH, DALLAS IS THE REASON

140
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:53,669

NOT ACCORDING
TO MY INFORMATION SHEET.

154

THEN YOUR INFORMATION SHEET
IS WRONG!

155
00:05:30,581 --> 00:05:31,707
PERHAPS YOU COULD
JUST STEP AWAY FROM THE BOOTH

156
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:34,209
UNTIL I SORT
THIS OUT-
NO!

157
00:05:34,293 --> 00:05:36,962

I-
NO!

00:05:37,045 --> 00:05:38,172
"N" TO THE "O"!
YOU CAN'T JUST  COME OVER HERE,

159
00:05:38,255 --> 00:05:40,507
AND ASSUME I'M DOING
SOMETHING WRONG!

160
00:05:40,591 --> 00:05:42,217

YOU KNOW WHAT?

161
00:05:42,301 --> 00:05:43,260
DO WHAT YOU GOTTA DO,

164
00:05:50,601 --> 00:05:52,728
IF ONLY SHE KNEW
THAT HER FATHER DID LOVE HER,

165
00:05:52,811 --> 00:05:55,355
AND THAT SHE WASN'T
ABANDONED BY HIM.

166
00:05:55,439 --> 00:05:57,733
HE ONLY LEFT
TO KEEP HER SAFE.

167
00:05:57,816 --> 00:05:59,318
THAT'S ALL I HAVE
RIGHT NOW.

168
00:06:00,652 --> 00:06:02,279
GREAT START, ZOE.

169
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:03,864
I LIKE THAT SHE'S GOT SASS,

170
00:06:03,947 --> 00:06:06,366
BUT IS SMART ABOUT
HOW SHE USES IT.

171
00:06:06,450 --> 00:06:09,786
I AGREE.
THAT'S DEFINITELY THE BEST PART.

172
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:12,956
MR. YATES:
I WONDER IF DADDY ISSUES
ISN'T A LITTLE CLICHE.

173
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,791

174
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:16,376
WE'VE SEEN IT
A MILLION TIMES!

175
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:19,630
MR. YATES:
TAKE ANOTHER CRACK, ZOE.

176
00:06:19,713 --> 00:06:22,883
SEE IF YOU CAN FIND
A MORE UNIQUE APPROACH.

177
00:06:22,966 --> 00:06:24,468
I TOTALLY AGREE
WITH GRANT.

178
00:06:26,803 --> 00:06:28,305
WHY DON'T YOU READ NEXT,
TRISTAN?

179
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:30,599
YES, SINCE YOU SEEM TO HAVE
SO MUCH TO SAY!

180
00:06:30,682 --> 00:06:32,184
GLADLY!

181
00:06:33,268 --> 00:06:35,145
(CLEARS THROAT)

182
00:06:35,229 --> 00:06:37,564
WALLACE DEVERAUX IS THE YOUNG,
HANDSOME,

183
00:06:37,648 --> 00:06:40,484
HEIR TO AN AIRPLANE
MANUFACTURING FORTUNE.

184
00:06:40,567 --> 00:06:42,069
HE DOESN'T WEAR
A HUGO BOSS SUIT,

185
00:06:42,152 --> 00:06:43,487
HE WORKS IT!

186
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:45,489
(ALL CHUCKLE)

187
00:06:45,572 --> 00:06:46,782
JUST A MINUTE,
IT GETS BETTER.

188
00:06:46,865 --> 00:06:48,575
ZOE:
IT SOUNDS LIKE
A SOAP OPERA CHARACTER.

189
00:06:48,659 --> 00:06:51,537
MR. YATES:
I'D AGREE.

190
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:53,497
THIS ISN'T WHAT I WAS EXPECTING
FROM YOU, TRISTAN.

191
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:56,667
THE WRITING LACKS DEPTH
AND SPECIFICITY,

192
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:58,710
AND FRANKLY,
IT'S... BORING.

193
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:03,131
WHO'S NEXT?

194
00:07:10,889 --> 00:07:12,850
THE JUDGES ARE ON THEIR WAY,
ARE WE READY?

195
00:07:14,476 --> 00:07:16,645
ARE YOU OKAY?

196
00:07:16,728 --> 00:07:19,606
UM, YEAH.
YEAH, LET'S DO THIS.

197
00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:21,441
JUDGE: MISS BHANDARI.
ALLI: HI.

198
00:07:21,525 --> 00:07:23,068
GOOD AFTERNOON, JUDGES,

199
00:07:23,151 --> 00:07:25,028
AND WELCOME
TO "ORGANIC FRUIT FLIES."

200
00:07:25,112 --> 00:07:26,822
THIS IS MY PARTNER,
MIKE DALLAS.

201
00:07:26,905 --> 00:07:30,868
SEE? PARTNER!
I TOLD YOU!

202
00:07:30,951 --> 00:07:33,537
WELL, WE DON'T SEEM TO HAVE
YOUR NAME ON THIS PROJECT.

203
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:35,122
HOW CONVENIENT.

204
00:07:37,165 --> 00:07:38,876
UH, COULD YOU START
WITH AN OVERVIEW, MISS BHANDARI?

205
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:39,793
ALLI:
SURE.

206
00:07:39,877 --> 00:07:41,461
IN OUR EXPERIMENT,

207
00:07:41,545 --> 00:07:43,839
WE CONCLUDED THAT
BY NEARLY EVERY MEASURE -

208
00:07:43,922 --> 00:07:46,216
FERTILITY, STRESS, RESISTANCE,
AND LONGEVITY -

209
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:48,051
FLIES THAT FED OFF
ORGANIC TOMATOES AND BANANAS

210
00:07:48,135 --> 00:07:49,553
FARED BETTER THAN THOSE

211
00:07:49,636 --> 00:07:51,263
WHO DINED OFF
CONVENTIONALLY GROWN FRUIT.

212
00:07:51,346 --> 00:07:52,890
AH, BUT THE RESULTS
CAN'T BE DIRECTLY

213
00:07:52,973 --> 00:07:55,184
EXTRAPOLATED TO HUMANS.

214
00:07:55,267 --> 00:07:57,144
NO, BUT THEY CAN PROVIDE CLUES
TO BETTER UNDERSTANDING

215
00:07:57,227 --> 00:07:59,730
HUMAN PROCESSES AND DISEASE.

216
00:07:59,813 --> 00:08:02,024
SO WHY FRUIT FLIES?

217
00:08:02,107 --> 00:08:03,150
DALLAS:
BECAUSE OF THEIR
SHORT LIFESPAN,

218
00:08:03,233 --> 00:08:04,610
WE CAN EVALUATE
BASIC BIOLOGICAL EFFECTS

219
00:08:04,693 --> 00:08:06,195
OVER A FINITE
PERIOD OF TIME.

220
00:08:06,862 --> 00:08:09,531
THAT'S IMPRESSIVE.

221
00:08:09,615 --> 00:08:12,326
DALLAS:
WHAT'S IMPRESSIVE?
MY VOCABULARY?!

222
00:08:12,409 --> 00:08:15,537
I HAPPEN TO KNOW
A PLETHORA OF LARGE WORDS.

223
00:08:15,621 --> 00:08:16,622
YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOUR TONE IS A BIT RUDE,

224
00:08:16,705 --> 00:08:17,873
YOUNG MAN!

225
00:08:17,956 --> 00:08:18,874
I WONDER WHY THAT IS!

226
00:08:18,957 --> 00:08:20,417
ALLI:
DALLAS, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!

227
00:08:20,501 --> 00:08:21,627
I THINK WE'VE SEEN
ENOUGH HERE.

228
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:23,754
NO, NO, BUT WAIT!

229
00:08:23,837 --> 00:08:24,671
WE HAVEN'T SHOWN YOU
OUR HYPOTHESIS,

230
00:08:24,755 --> 00:08:26,465
OR ANY OF THE DATA!

231
00:08:26,548 --> 00:08:27,883
WELL, PERHAPS
WE'LL STOP BY LATER,

232
00:08:27,966 --> 00:08:29,927
WHEN YOUR "PARTNER" HAS LEARNED
A LITTLE RESPECT

233
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:31,386
FOR THE PROCESS!

234
00:08:31,470 --> 00:08:32,971
WHEN I LEARN
A LITTLE RESPECT?!

235
00:08:33,055 --> 00:08:33,764
YOU TRIED
TO KICK ME OUT EARLIER

236
00:08:33,847 --> 00:08:35,390
BECAUSE I'M A BLACK MAN

237
00:08:35,474 --> 00:08:36,683
IN A PLACE
YOU DIDN'T THINK I SHOULD BE!

238
00:08:36,767 --> 00:08:38,268
OH MY GOD!

239
00:08:39,978 --> 00:08:41,813
LET'S MOVE ON.

240
00:08:41,897 --> 00:08:45,609
ALLI:
BUT YOU'LL COME BACK LATER,
RIGHT?

241
00:08:45,692 --> 00:08:47,611
I CANNOT BELIEVE
YOU SPOKE TO HIM LIKE THAT!

242
00:08:47,694 --> 00:08:48,570
I TOLD THE TRUTH,
HE DESERVED IT!

243
00:08:48,654 --> 00:08:51,156
YEAH,
BUT DID I DESERVE IT?!

244
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:53,200
YOU RUINED EVERYTHING,
DALLAS!

245
00:09:00,832 --> 00:09:02,209
(PARTICIPANTS CHATTER)

246
00:09:02,292 --> 00:09:03,794
ALLI.

247
00:09:05,212 --> 00:09:07,130
I HAD REASONS
TO SAY WHAT I SAID.

248
00:09:13,053 --> 00:09:14,972
YOU CALLED THE SCIENCE FAIR
JUDGE A RACIST

249
00:09:15,055 --> 00:09:16,056
IN FRONT OF EVERYONE!

250
00:09:16,139 --> 00:09:17,975
BECAUSE HE IS!

251
00:09:18,058 --> 00:09:19,935
IT WAS A MISCOMMUNICATION,
THAT'S ALL!

252
00:09:20,018 --> 00:09:21,854
HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT?

253
00:09:21,937 --> 00:09:23,897
HOW CAN YOU BE SURE
THAT THAT'S THE REASON?

254
00:09:23,981 --> 00:09:26,024
I CAN'T.

255
00:09:26,108 --> 00:09:27,568
BUT I KNOW YOU'RE STILL UPSET
ABOUT YESTERDAY.

256
00:09:27,651 --> 00:09:30,821
I'M NOT UPSET,
I'M FURIOUS!

257
00:09:30,904 --> 00:09:32,030
ONE IDIOT DID SOMETHING
AT THE MALL,

258
00:09:32,114 --> 00:09:34,241
AND I GET DETAINED
LIKE A CRIMINAL?!

259
00:09:34,324 --> 00:09:36,159
THEN I GET PULLED OVER
BY THE COPS FOR NO REASON,

260
00:09:36,243 --> 00:09:37,536
OTHER THAN THE FACT THAT
I'M A BLACK GUY DRIVING AN SUV!

261
00:09:37,619 --> 00:09:38,787
YOU GOT PULLED OVER?

262
00:09:38,871 --> 00:09:39,913
I WAS GONNA TELL YOU,
BUT...

263
00:09:39,997 --> 00:09:41,373
HAD YOU JUST TALKED TO ME,

264
00:09:41,456 --> 00:09:43,333
I WOULD'VE UNDERSTOOD
AND SUPPORTED YOU,

265
00:09:43,417 --> 00:09:44,585
BUT INSTEAD YOU BOTTLED IT UP
AND EXPLODED

266
00:09:44,668 --> 00:09:45,711
AT THE WORST POSSIBLE MOMENT!

267
00:09:45,794 --> 00:09:47,337
THIS WHOLE FAIR,

268
00:09:47,421 --> 00:09:48,213
EVERYTHING WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON
FOR WEEKS,

269
00:09:48,297 --> 00:09:50,299
IT'S ALL OVER!

270
00:09:50,382 --> 00:09:51,341
DALLAS:
NO! NO, IT'S NOT.
I'M GONNA FIGURE SOMETHING OUT.

271
00:09:51,425 --> 00:09:54,052
NO, JUST DON'T!

272
00:09:54,136 --> 00:09:55,429
IF I'M LUCKY ENOUGH
TO HAVE THE JUDGES COME BACK,

273
00:09:55,512 --> 00:09:57,014
I WANT TO PRESENT ALONE.

274
00:10:03,312 --> 00:10:04,813
(SIGHS HEAVILY)

275
00:10:15,699 --> 00:10:18,660
DREW:
EDEN BAILED ON OUR SECOND DATE.

276
00:10:18,744 --> 00:10:22,414
SHE GOT THIS... THIS IDEA

277
00:10:22,497 --> 00:10:23,999
THAT I WASN'T OVER BIANCA.

278
00:10:29,254 --> 00:10:30,756
FROM YOU.

279
00:10:34,301 --> 00:10:37,262
SHE ASKED ME QUESTIONS,
I ANSWERED.

280
00:10:37,346 --> 00:10:39,139
DREW: I AM OVER BIANCA!
CLARE: I KNOW.

281
00:10:39,223 --> 00:10:40,807
DREW:
I DON'T GET YOU!

282
00:10:40,891 --> 00:10:42,518
FIRST, YOU WANT ME
TO GET A GIRLFRIEND,

283
00:10:42,601 --> 00:10:43,977
THEN YOU FIND ME A GIRL,

284
00:10:44,061 --> 00:10:45,062
AND THEN YOU GO OUT OF YOUR WAY
TO SABOTAGE THIS WHOLE THING

285
00:10:45,145 --> 00:10:46,605
THAT YOU SET UP!

286
00:10:46,688 --> 00:10:48,190
I'M CONFUSED, OKAY?

287
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:53,278
EVER SINCE ELI DID THAT THING
WITH THAT GIRL,

288
00:10:53,362 --> 00:10:55,906
I FEEL SAD ALL THE TIME.

289
00:10:58,867 --> 00:11:00,953
BUT I DON'T
WHEN I'M WITH YOU.

290
00:11:01,036 --> 00:11:02,037
WELL, I THINK THAT'S
CALLED FRIENDSHIP.

291
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,455
YEAH,
AND THEN WE MADE OUT!

292
00:11:03,539 --> 00:11:05,082
DREW:
SOMETIMES FRIENDS DO THAT.

293
00:11:05,165 --> 00:11:07,125
LOOK, I'VE MADE OUT WITH PEOPLE
THAT I DON'T EVEN REALLY LIKE!

294
00:11:07,209 --> 00:11:08,710
(BOTH LAUGH)

295
00:11:11,755 --> 00:11:14,132
SEE, I SHOULD BE UPSET,
BUT INSTEAD, I'M LAUGHING!

296
00:11:15,759 --> 00:11:17,386
I'M ANNABELLA.

297
00:11:17,469 --> 00:11:19,847
I SET UP THAT PROFILE
AS A KIND OF TEST.

298
00:11:22,349 --> 00:11:23,851
I KNOW.

299
00:11:25,769 --> 00:11:30,858
YOU KNEW?
AND YOU PICKED EDEN INSTEAD.

300
00:11:33,569 --> 00:11:35,863
(SIGHS)

301
00:11:35,946 --> 00:11:38,448
BECAUSE "ANNABELLA"
HAS A BOYFRIEND.

302
00:11:40,242 --> 00:11:41,743
IF SHE WAS SINGLE,

303
00:11:41,827 --> 00:11:44,454
IT WOULD BE A COMPLETELY
DIFFERENT STORY.

304
00:11:44,538 --> 00:11:46,039
WHAT NOW?

305
00:11:48,083 --> 00:11:49,001
DREW: WHAT?
CLARE: WHAT DID YOU JUST SAY?

306
00:11:49,084 --> 00:11:50,586
WHAT DID I SAY WHEN?

307
00:11:50,669 --> 00:11:52,045
CLARE:
YOU SAID IF ANNABELLA
WERE SINGLE,

308
00:11:52,129 --> 00:11:54,047
IT WOULD BE A DIFFERENT STORY,
BUT ANNABELLA ISN'T YOUR TYPE!

309
00:11:54,131 --> 00:11:55,632
SAYS WHO?

310
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,302
I LIKE WHO I LIKE.

311
00:12:02,222 --> 00:12:05,309
I GUESS THE BALL'S
IN ANNABELLA'S COURT NOW.

312
00:12:05,392 --> 00:12:08,478
♪ You could always
make me feel all right ♪

313
00:12:08,562 --> 00:12:10,606
♪ I thought you were lost ♪

314
00:12:12,608 --> 00:12:14,484
♪ I thought you were lost ♪

315
00:12:16,486 --> 00:12:19,281
♪ I thought you were lost ♪

316
00:12:21,241 --> 00:12:23,243
WHAT HAPPENED?

317
00:12:23,327 --> 00:12:24,828
MR. YATES HAPPENED.

318
00:12:29,666 --> 00:12:31,460
THE WEIRDO
ENGLISH TEACHER.

319
00:12:31,543 --> 00:12:33,295
HEY, HE'S NOT WEIRD!

320
00:12:33,378 --> 00:12:36,173
HE'S ECCENTRIC
AND AWESOME!

321
00:12:36,256 --> 00:12:37,925
AND I THOUGHT HE THOUGHT
I WAS AWESOME TOO,

322
00:12:38,008 --> 00:12:39,051
BUT APPARENTLY
I'M JUST ANOTHER DUMB STUDENT.

323
00:12:39,134 --> 00:12:40,636
WHAT DID YOU EXPECT?

324
00:12:40,719 --> 00:12:42,930
THAT WE'D BE FRIENDS.

325
00:12:43,013 --> 00:12:44,890
THAT HE'D BE SOMEBODY
I COULD ACTUALLY TALK TO.

326
00:12:44,973 --> 00:12:45,849
I DON'T THINK A TEACHER
IS THE BEST PLACE

327
00:12:45,933 --> 00:12:49,061
TO START LOOKING FOR THAT.

328
00:12:49,144 --> 00:12:51,522
MAYBE YOU SHOULDN'T PUT PEOPLE
ON A PEDESTAL ALL THE TIME.

329
00:12:51,605 --> 00:12:53,482
EVENTUALLY,
EVERYONE DISAPPOINTS.

330
00:12:57,069 --> 00:12:58,570
(SIGHS HEAVILY)

331
00:13:02,407 --> 00:13:02,866
IF YOU'VE COME TO TELL ME
I'M NOT GOOD ENOUGH

332
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:04,076
FOR YOUR DAUGHTER,

333
00:13:04,159 --> 00:13:05,869
I KNOW.

334
00:13:05,953 --> 00:13:07,704
I WANTED TO TELL YOU
A STORY, MR. DALLAS,

335
00:13:07,788 --> 00:13:09,289
IF YOU WILL INDULGE ME.

336
00:13:17,172 --> 00:13:18,257
A FEW YEARS AGO,
WE WERE TRAVELING OVERSEAS

337
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:21,301
TO MY COUSIN'S WEDDING.

338
00:13:21,385 --> 00:13:22,886
I WAS PULLED ASIDE
AT AIRPORT SECURITY

339
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:24,638
AND TAKEN TO A SMALL ROOM,

340
00:13:24,721 --> 00:13:26,932
WHERE I WAS DETAINED
AND QUESTIONED FOR HOURS.

341
00:13:27,015 --> 00:13:28,517
HOURS.

342
00:13:30,853 --> 00:13:32,896
WE MISSED OUR FLIGHT
AND ALL OUR CONNECTIONS.

343
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:35,315
WE DIDN'T ARRIVE IN TIME
FOR THE WEDDING.

344
00:13:35,399 --> 00:13:36,650
SITTING IN THAT ROOM,

345
00:13:36,733 --> 00:13:39,486
I FELT SO WRONGED
