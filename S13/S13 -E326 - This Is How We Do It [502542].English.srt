I FINALLY GOT SOME REST.

348
00:12:55,692 --> 00:12:57,194
I FEEL LIKE A NEW MAN!

349
00:12:58,862 --> 00:13:01,198
I SHOULD PROBABLY
GET TO CLASS.

350
00:13:01,281 --> 00:13:02,699
FEEL FREE TO CALL BACK
AND LEAVE THAT SEXY MESSAGE!

351
00:13:02,783 --> 00:13:04,493
BIANCA:
(SQUEALS SEXILY)

352
00:13:04,576 --> 00:13:05,494
SIMPSON:
I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU BEHAVE
ON A TV SHOW, ZOE,

353
00:13:05,577 --> 00:13:06,578
BUT WHAT YOU DID
YESTERDAY

354
00:13:06,662 --> 00:13:08,747
HAS NO PLACE
IN THE REAL WORLD!

355
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:10,332
CAN'T YOU JUST TRANSFER ME
OUT OF THAT CLASS?

356
00:13:10,415 --> 00:13:12,835
YOU ASSAULTED A TEACHER!

357
00:13:12,918 --> 00:13:15,379
WE MAY BE TALKING
ABOUT EXPULSION.

358
00:13:15,462 --> 00:13:16,380
ZOE HAS A LEARNING
DISABILITY.

359
00:13:16,463 --> 00:13:17,965
ZOE:
MOM!

360
00:13:18,382 --> 00:13:19,883
DYSLEXIA.

361
00:13:21,552 --> 00:13:23,053
IS THIS TRUE?

362
00:13:24,721 --> 00:13:26,223
ABSOLUTELY.

363
00:13:28,016 --> 00:13:30,894
ZOE, WILL YOU REQUIRE
EXTRA HELP WITH TESTS?

364
00:13:30,978 --> 00:13:32,479
NO, I WILL NOT.

365
00:13:35,482 --> 00:13:37,609
CAN I HAVE A MINUTE WITH
MY DAUGHTER, ALONE?

366
00:13:41,405 --> 00:13:42,906
I GUESS SO.

367
00:13:49,955 --> 00:13:52,332
HOW COULD YOU
TELL HIM THAT?!

368
00:13:52,416 --> 00:13:54,710
I JUST SAVED YOUR ASS!
HE WAS GONNA KICK YOU OUT!

369
00:13:54,793 --> 00:13:56,086
I WANTED HIM TO!
CAN'T YOU JUST HOME SCHOOL ME?

370
00:13:56,170 --> 00:13:57,671
NO!

371
00:13:57,754 --> 00:13:58,797
UNTIL YOU GET
ANOTHER JOB,

372
00:13:58,881 --> 00:14:00,549
I HAVE TO GET ONE
OF MY OWN.

373
00:14:00,632 --> 00:14:02,426
I'M NOT SUPPOSED
TO BE HERE.

374
00:14:02,509 --> 00:14:04,178
I KNOW.

375
00:14:04,261 --> 00:14:06,305
YOU SHOULD STILL BE
ON "WEST DRIVE,"

376
00:14:06,388 --> 00:14:09,391
BUT YOU GOT YOURSELF FIRED.

377
00:14:09,474 --> 00:14:11,977
NOBODY WANTS TO WORK
WITH YOU NOW,

378
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:14,062
SO DO WHATEVER IT TAKES
TO MAKE THIS WORK.

379
00:14:16,481 --> 00:14:17,983
(PANTING)

380
00:14:19,693 --> 00:14:21,862
DREW:
WHAT IS GOING ON?

381
00:14:21,945 --> 00:14:24,114
JUST CATCHING SOME RAYS
DURING MY SPARE!

382
00:14:24,198 --> 00:14:25,866
AM I STILL DREAMING?

383
00:14:25,949 --> 00:14:27,451
CLARE:
NOT COOL, DREW!

384
00:14:30,537 --> 00:14:31,413
IF YOU DIDN'T WANNA DO
THE TEXTING AND DRIVING CAMPAIGN

385
00:14:31,496 --> 00:14:32,497
BECAUSE OF ADAM,

386
00:14:32,581 --> 00:14:34,166
YOU COULD'VE SAID SO.

387
00:14:34,249 --> 00:14:35,876
I'M FINE, CLARE.
THEN I'M OFFICIALLY MAD

388
00:14:35,959 --> 00:14:37,920
THAT YOU ORDERED THIS STUFF
WITHOUT ME!

389
00:14:38,003 --> 00:14:40,380
WHAT?! I-I DIDN'T ORDER
ANY OF THIS STUFF!

390
00:14:40,464 --> 00:14:42,049
THIS INVOICE SAYS
OTHERWISE.

391
00:14:48,222 --> 00:14:50,432
IMOGEN:
HEY!

392
00:14:50,516 --> 00:14:52,726
IF YOU GUYS FIND OUT
WHO DID ORDER ALL THIS STUFF,

393
00:14:52,809 --> 00:14:55,312
CAN YOU ASK THEM TO GET US
A MINI WAVE POOL, TOO?

394
00:14:55,395 --> 00:14:56,480
DREW:
YEAH...

395
00:14:56,563 --> 00:14:58,065
(BELL RINGS)

396
00:15:00,442 --> 00:15:02,611
DUDE, CLARE IS NOT HAPPY.

397
00:15:02,694 --> 00:15:05,531
I KNOW,
IT'S HILARIOUS.

398
00:15:05,614 --> 00:15:06,532
SO DID YOU ORDER
ALL THE SAND?

399
00:15:06,615 --> 00:15:08,116
WHAT? NO.
YOU DID!

400
00:15:09,451 --> 00:15:11,203
LAST NIGHT.

401
00:15:11,286 --> 00:15:11,912
YOU DON'T REMEMBER?

402
00:15:11,995 --> 00:15:13,997
NO!

403
00:15:14,081 --> 00:15:14,831
YOU WERE BANGING AROUND
THE KITCHEN AT LIKE 3:00 A.M.,

404
00:15:14,915 --> 00:15:17,167
SO I GOT UP.

405
00:15:17,251 --> 00:15:18,293
YOU WERE EATING ICE CREAM
AND PLACING AN ORDER ONLINE.

406
00:15:18,377 --> 00:15:19,837
WHAT?! ALL RIGHT,

407
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:22,089
BIANCA SAID THAT
I TALKED TO HER, TOO.

408
00:15:22,172 --> 00:15:23,549
I TOOK THOSE SLEEPING PILLS;
I THOUGHT I SLEPT SO WELL!

409
00:15:23,632 --> 00:15:26,593
DUDE, THOSE PILLS WORK
FOR SOME PEOPLE,

410
00:15:26,677 --> 00:15:29,346
BUT OTHER PEOPLE
GET CRAZY SIDE EFFECTS.

411
00:15:29,429 --> 00:15:30,264
SO I ORDERED THE SAND.

412
00:15:30,347 --> 00:15:32,391
BIG TIME.

413
00:15:32,474 --> 00:15:34,226
GUESS YOU REALLY WANTED
THAT BEACH DANCE.

414
00:15:34,309 --> 00:15:35,352
SO WHAT DO I DO?

415
00:15:35,435 --> 00:15:36,854
PRAY FOR A MIRACLE,

416
00:15:36,937 --> 00:15:37,980
AND HOPE YOU WIN THE VOTE
AT COUNCIL.

417
00:15:38,063 --> 00:15:39,565
OH GOSH...

418
00:15:41,358 --> 00:15:44,653
(GIRLS GIGGLE)

419
00:15:44,736 --> 00:15:46,238
I THINK THERE MIGHT BE A WAY.

420
00:15:48,782 --> 00:15:50,117
IS ANYONE GOING TO THE FASHION
CLUB MEETING TONIGHT?

421
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,535
NO, I'M GONNA WORK
ON A SONG.

422
00:15:51,618 --> 00:15:52,494
I'M THINKING OF STARTING
A NEW BAND.

423
00:15:52,578 --> 00:15:53,829
NO, DON'T LOOK AT ME.

424
00:15:53,912 --> 00:15:54,913
THE ONLY THING I DO
IS BASKETBALL

425
00:15:54,997 --> 00:15:56,623
AND THAT'S 'CAUSE MY DAD
MAKES ME.

426
00:15:56,707 --> 00:15:57,958
TRISTAN:
COOL. I COULD PLAY BASKETBALL.

427
00:15:58,041 --> 00:15:59,918
SERIOUSLY?!

428
00:16:00,002 --> 00:16:01,253
TRISTAN:
MY BROTHER PLAYED.
I COULD DO IT.

429
00:16:01,336 --> 00:16:03,088
I HAVE A KILLER JUNK SHOT.

430
00:16:03,172 --> 00:16:04,423

YOU MEAN JUMP SHOT?

431
00:16:04,506 --> 00:16:06,133

UM, HEY, DO THEY HAVE
CHEERLEADERS HERE?

433
00:16:09,052 --> 00:16:11,930
MAYBE I COULD CHEER YOU GUYS ON.

434
00:16:12,014 --> 00:16:13,098
LET ME PUT THIS
IN TV TERMS,

435
00:16:13,182 --> 00:16:14,808

00:16:37,331 --> 00:16:39,416
UM... WHAT DO I HAVE TO DO?

444
00:16:39,499 --> 00:16:41,335
I'LL EXPLAIN ON THE WAY.

445

448
00:16:50,177 --> 00:16:51,512
I HAVE NO IDEA.

449
00:16:51,595 --> 00:16:52,888
I SHOULD'VE ORDERED
THE ESPRESSO.

450
00:16:52,971 --> 00:16:55,933
I MEAN WITH US,
YOU COMING HERE.

451
00:16:56,016 --> 00:16:57,476
I MEAN,
WHAT'S OUR GAME PLAN?

452
00:16:57,559 --> 00:16:59,770
TO TAKE A CHANCE

453
00:16:59,853 --> 00:17:00,854
OKAY, BUT WHAT HAPPENS
WHEN YOU LEAVE?

454
00:17:00,938 --> 00:17:02,731
I WON'T.

455
00:17:02,814 --> 00:17:04,900
I CAN STAY WITH MY GODFATHER
AS LONG AS I WANT.

456
00:17:04,983 --> 00:17:07,152
BUT WHAT ARE YOU
GONNA DO?

457
00:17:07,236 --> 00:17:09,112
I HAVE SCHOOL,

461
00:17:13,242 --> 00:17:15,911
WHERE?
HERE.

462
00:17:15,994 --> 00:17:18,455
THEY NEED SOMEONE TO TEACH THEM
HOW TO MAKE COFFEE.

463
00:17:18,539 --> 00:17:20,249
WE CAN DO THIS,

00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:29,007
I MEAN, LAST TIME
YOU HURT ME.

467
00:17:29,091 --> 00:17:30,592
I DIDN'T MEAN TO.
YOU LEFT BRUISES!

468
00:17:30,676 --> 00:17:32,219
I OVERREACTED,
I LOST CONTROL.

469
00:17:32,302 --> 00:17:34,638
IT WON'T HAPPEN AGAIN.

470
00:17:34,721 --> 00:17:37,766
I DON'T WANT TO BE
THAT PERSON,

471
00:17:37,850 --> 00:17:40,853

YOU COULD HELP ME BE BETTER.

I THOUGHT WE MIGHT HAVE
THE VOTE FIRST.

481
00:18:06,461 --> 00:18:07,671

HOW THE VOTE'S GONNA GO, RIGHT?
