EVERYBODY SHUSH!

177
00:06:37,898 --> 00:06:39,566
TOGETHER WE HAVE FOUGHT
THE GOOD FIGHT

178
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:41,401
AND WE HAVE EMERGED VICTORIOUS!

179
00:06:41,485 --> 00:06:43,570

SIMPSON WANTS TO KNOW
WHAT WE WANT IN THE DRESS CODE.

181
00:06:45,072 --> 00:06:46,323
NOW WE CAN MAKE A DRESS CODE
FOR THE PEOPLE,

182
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:47,783
BY THE PEOPLE!

183
00:06:47,866 --> 00:06:49,576
SO... WHAT DO WE WANT?

184
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:51,578
BRA TOPS.

185
00:06:51,662 --> 00:06:52,746
I'M NOT SURE
THEY'RE GONNA GO FOR THAT.

186
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:54,373

187
00:06:54,456 --> 00:06:57,709

193
00:07:05,926 --> 00:07:08,554

GET BOYFRIENDS?

THAT'S THE ONLY THING
THAT DICTATES YOUR WARDROBE?!

195
00:07:10,097 --> 00:07:11,431

THIS ISN'T WHAT I FOUGHT FOR!

198

199
00:07:18,564 --> 00:07:20,148

206
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,210
OH, CRAP.
MAYBE SHE WON'T SEE ME.

207
00:07:40,294 --> 00:07:42,045
YOU'RE STANDING
IN THE MIDDLE OF A ROOM.

208

213
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:54,600
WHY ARE YOU IGNORING ME?

214
00:07:54,683 --> 00:07:56,393
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?!

215
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:57,978
YOU SAID YOU'RE GONNA BE
TOO BUSY TO SEE ME.

216
00:07:58,061 --> 00:07:58,478
IF I HELP OUT,
YOU CAN DO YOUR WORK

217
00:07:58,562 --> 00:08:00,105
AND SEE ME!

218
00:08:00,189 --> 00:08:03,442
LOOK,
I-I DON'T WANT YOU HERE.

219
00:08:03,525 --> 00:08:04,776
BUT I'M YOUR GIRLFRIEND-

220
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:07,070
NO, YOU'RE NOT!
I BROKE UP WITH YOU!

221
00:08:09,364 --> 00:08:10,866
NO, YOU DIDN'T.

222
00:08:11,992 --> 00:08:13,785
I WAS TRYING
TO LET YOU DOWN EASY.

223
00:08:13,869 --> 00:08:16,413
CLEARLY YOU DIDN'T
GET THE MESSAGE!

224
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:18,457
THAT'S WHAT THAT WAS?!

225
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:19,750
IT WAS THAT EASY
FOR YOU?

226
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:21,418
WE HAD SEX!

227
00:08:21,502 --> 00:08:23,212
I TOTALLY REGRET THAT NOW.

228
00:08:26,089 --> 00:08:29,051
LOOK, ZOE, I'M SORRY-

229
00:08:29,134 --> 00:08:32,721

DON'T YOU DARE TOUCH ME.

234
00:08:46,527 --> 00:08:47,986
A LITTLE BIRDIE TOLD ME

235
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:49,238
YOU'RE LOOKING
FOR A NEW LAB ASSISTANT.

236
00:08:49,321 --> 00:08:50,906
WELL, YOU CAN TELL
THAT LITTLE BIRDIE

237
00:08:50,989 --> 00:08:52,908
THAT I'M DONE
WITH THE SCIENCE FAIR.

238
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:54,201
YOU DON'T QUIT THINGS
YOU LOVE.

239
00:08:54,284 --> 00:08:55,536
YEAH, BUT IT USED
TO JUST BE ME

240
00:08:55,619 --> 00:08:57,162
IN THE LAB.

241
00:08:57,246 --> 00:08:59,915
I WAS AT THE TOP OF MY GAME,
AND NOW...

242
00:08:59,998 --> 00:09:01,124
WELL,
YOU WOULDN'T UNDERSTAND.

243
00:09:01,208 --> 00:09:03,377
YOU'D BE SURPRISED.

244
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:05,879
I GOT KICKED OFF
THE ICE HOUNDS.

245
00:09:05,963 --> 00:09:07,381
MIKE DALLAS
WITHOUT HOCKEY?

246
00:09:07,464 --> 00:09:08,924
YEAH.

247
00:09:09,007 --> 00:09:10,425
I WAS A DISASTER.

248
00:09:10,509 --> 00:09:12,219
WHAT'D YOU DO?

249
00:09:12,302 --> 00:09:14,096
I FOUND A REC LEAGUE
TO KEEP ME ON THE ICE.

250
00:09:14,179 --> 00:09:16,682
I JOINED THE BASKETBALL TEAM,
BUT IT'S NOT THE SAME.

251
00:09:16,765 --> 00:09:18,892
SO, I ASK AGAIN,

252
00:09:18,976 --> 00:09:21,478
DO YOU NEED
A LAB ASSISTANT?

253
00:09:21,562 --> 00:09:24,356
ARE YOU SURE THIS ISN'T PART
OF SOME ELABORATE PICK-UP PLAN?

254
00:09:24,439 --> 00:09:25,732
DON'T FLATTER YOURSELF,
BHANDARI.

255
00:09:25,816 --> 00:09:27,693
BUT I HAVE TWO REQUESTS:

256
00:09:27,776 --> 00:09:29,069
ONE, WE WIN THIS THING,
AND TWO-

257
00:09:29,152 --> 00:09:31,405
YOU WANT A DATE
WITH ME.

258
00:09:31,488 --> 00:09:33,866
SOMEONE'S A LITTLE OBSESSED
WITH THEMSELVES.

259
00:09:33,949 --> 00:09:35,409
WHAT'S YOUR REQUEST,
DALLAS?

260
00:09:35,492 --> 00:09:36,451
THAT WHEN WE'RE
IN THE LAB,

261
00:09:36,535 --> 00:09:38,704
WE ONLY TALK
ABOUT SCIENCE.

262
00:09:38,787 --> 00:09:40,289
NOTHING PERSONAL.
THINK YOU CAN HANDLE THAT?

263
00:09:40,372 --> 00:09:41,874
I... DO.

264
00:09:42,875 --> 00:09:44,793
GOOD.

265
00:09:44,877 --> 00:09:47,296
THEN YOU'LL NEED
YOUR LAB COAT BACK.

266
00:09:47,379 --> 00:09:49,298
YOU FISHED IT OUT
OF THE GARBAGE?

267
00:09:49,381 --> 00:09:51,717
YOU MIGHT WANT
TO BLEACH IT FIRST.

268

269
00:09:56,180 --> 00:09:57,723
MR. HOLLINGSWORTH:
UNLIKE MY OPPONENTS,

270
00:09:57,806 --> 00:10:01,393
I WON'T GET RID OF

271
00:10:01,476 --> 00:10:03,145
SEVENTY-FIVE BUCKS?

272
00:10:03,228 --> 00:10:04,688
THAT'S YOUTH SOCCER PROGRAMS,

273
00:10:04,771 --> 00:10:07,065
THAT'S HOUSING
FOR HOMELESS FAMILIES.

274
00:10:07,149 --> 00:10:10,110
AND I'M SORRY,
BUT I BELIEVE IN COMMUNITY!

275
00:10:10,194 --> 00:10:11,653

00:10:29,046 --> 00:10:31,673
THIS FORUM IS TO GET KNOW
MR. HOLLINGSWORTH,

284
00:10:31,757 --> 00:10:33,467
NOT ME.

285
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:35,052
MS. RIVAS:
OKAY, FINE.

286
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:37,596
MR. HOLLINGSWORTH,

00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:39,556
HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT

288
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:41,308

OF A 15-YEAR-OLD GIRL?!

289
00:10:41,391 --> 00:10:43,060
MR. HOLLINGSWORTH:
UM, MS.?

290
00:10:43,143 --> 00:10:44,353
MS. RIVAS: RIVAS.
MR. HOLLINGSWORTH: RIVAS.

291
00:10:44,436 --> 00:10:45,979
MS. RIVAS, I DON'T BELIEVE
THIS IS THE FORUM

292
00:10:46,063 --> 00:10:48,732
TO EXPLORE THIS.

293
00:10:48,815 --> 00:10:50,234

YOUR DISCUSSION WITH DREW

TO WEAR BRAS.

297
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:12,297
OKAY, WHAT ABOUT BOYS?

298
00:11:12,381 --> 00:11:14,758
THEY DON'T HAVE TO WEAR
BRAS EITHER...

299
00:11:14,842 --> 00:11:16,718
OR THEY CAN
IF THEY WANT?

300
00:11:16,802 --> 00:11:18,637
NO! SHOULDN'T WE PUT STUFF
IN THERE TO STOP BOYS

301
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:19,638
FROM PULLING THEIR JEANS
DOWN LOW

302
00:11:19,721 --> 00:11:21,139
AND SHOWING
THEIR BOXER SHORTS?

303
00:11:21,223 --> 00:11:22,724
YES!
THAT LOOK HAS PASSED.

304
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:27,271
BUT THAT'S OPPRESSIVE TOO.

305
00:11:27,354 --> 00:11:29,982
UGH!
WHY IS THIS SO HARD?!

306
00:11:30,065 --> 00:11:31,692
CAN'T PEOPLE JUST WEAR
WHAT THEY WANT?

307
00:11:31,775 --> 00:11:33,193
WE DON'T WANT PEOPLE
WALKING AROUND NAKED.

308
00:11:33,277 --> 00:11:35,863
RIGHT.

309
00:11:35,946 --> 00:11:39,908
BUT IT'S LIKE ANY DRESS CODE
INFRINGES ON PEOPLE'S FREEDOMS.

310
00:11:39,992 --> 00:11:41,910
AND SINCE BOYS AND GIRLS
DON'T DRESS THE SAME,

311
00:11:41,994 --> 00:11:43,829
WE CAN'T HAVE ONE SET
OF RULES.

312
00:11:43,912 --> 00:11:46,081
MAYBE IT DOESN'T MATTER
WHAT PEOPLE WEAR,

313
00:11:46,164 --> 00:11:47,666
ONLY WHY THEY WEAR IT.

314
00:11:49,293 --> 00:11:50,794
SO IF YOU ACCIDENTALLY
FORGET TO WEAR A BRA...

315
00:11:50,878 --> 00:11:51,962
OR EXPOSE YOUR MIDRIFF...

316

YOU WON'T GET IN TROUBLE!

318
00:11:55,757 --> 00:11:56,675
WITH THE INTENTION
OF DISTRACTING OTHER STUDENTS,

319
00:11:56,758 --> 00:11:58,260
YOU WILL.
