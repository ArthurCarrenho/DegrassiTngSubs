YOU SHOULD BE HAPPY WITH
ASSEZ BIEN, MADEMOISELLE.

207
00:08:49,154 --> 00:08:51,865
IT'S CLEAR YOU DID NOT
GO TO THE LOUVRE.

208
00:08:51,949 --> 00:08:55,410
YOU DESCRIBED THE MONA LISA
AS "BIG."

209
00:08:55,494 --> 00:08:57,704
OKAY, LOOK, MADAME,
I KNOW I MESSED UP,

210
00:08:57,788 --> 00:09:02,042
BUT IS THERE ANY WAY
I CAN HAVE A REDO?

211
00:09:02,125 --> 00:09:04,044

I'M SORRY, CLARE!

227
00:10:01,977 --> 00:10:03,478

237
00:10:33,592 --> 00:10:35,344

YOU BROUGHT A DOG
TO A HOSPITAL?!

242
00:10:48,815 --> 00:10:50,067

HAS GOTTEN WORSE.
