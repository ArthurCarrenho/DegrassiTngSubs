IN THIS SCENE,

97
00:04:14,296 --> 00:04:17,633
YOU ARE SEARCHING
FOR AN ESCAPE,

98
00:04:17,716 --> 00:04:20,219
BUT YOU REALIZE THE ONLY ESCAPE
IS TO KILL YOURSELF.

99
00:04:22,429 --> 00:04:25,182
QUESTION.
WHAT IF, INSTEAD OF THAT,

100
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:26,767
SHE ACTUALLY ESCAPED?

101
00:04:28,018 --> 00:04:29,728
HMM.

102
00:04:29,811 --> 00:04:31,313
I WANNA SHOW GIRLS

JUST HELPLESS VICTIMS.

104
00:04:33,941 --> 00:04:34,608
