BECKY: HI.

354
00:19:50,607 --> 00:19:52,025
I JUST WANTED
TO SAY THANKS.

355
00:19:52,109 --> 00:19:53,277
ADAM LOVED A GOOD PARTY,

356
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:54,027
IT'S A SHAME
HE HAD TO MISS IT.

357
00:19:54,111 --> 00:19:55,612
HE DIDN'T.

358
00:19:55,696 --> 00:19:57,239
HE'S HERE.

359
00:19:57,322 --> 00:19:58,824
I CAN FEEL IT.

360
00:20:02,202 --> 00:20:03,495
THEN HE'D BE PRETTY MAD

361
00:20:03,579 --> 00:20:05,706
AT THE WAY I TREATED
THE GIRL HE LOVED.

362
00:20:08,292 --> 00:20:10,127
BECKY,
IT WASN'T YOUR FAULT.
IT WASN'T ANYONE'S.

363
00:20:14,006 --> 00:20:15,507
(SIGHS HEAVILY)

364
00:20:16,842 --> 00:20:18,427
SO HOW DO WE MOVE ON?

365
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:21,722
I MEAN, WHAT DO WE DO?

366
00:20:24,141 --> 00:20:26,602
I GUESS MAKE ADAM'S DEATH
MEAN SOMETHING.
