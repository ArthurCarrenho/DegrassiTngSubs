00:14:44,843 --> 00:14:47,179
YOU TOLD MS. GRELL!

347
00:14:47,262 --> 00:14:49,431
AS WHAT, LIKE REVENGE
OR SOMETHING?

348
00:14:49,515 --> 00:14:51,725
I DIDN'T STEAL
YOUR STUPID LAPTOP, MAYA!

349
00:14:51,808 --> 00:14:53,769
I DON'T CARE
ABOUT MY LAPTOP!

350
00:14:53,852 --> 00:14:56,146
I CARE ABOUT YOU.

351
00:14:56,230 --> 00:14:58,524
THEN YOU SHOULD
MIND YOUR OWN BUSINESS!

352
00:14:58,607 --> 00:15:00,442
YOU KNOW GRELL'S GOING
TO CALL CHILDREN'S AID?!

353
00:15:00,526 --> 00:15:01,652
AND SINCE I HAVE
NOWHERE TO GO,

354
00:15:01,735 --> 00:15:03,362
THEY'RE GONNA PUT ME
IN A GROUP HOME.

355
00:15:03,445 --> 00:15:06,490
ISN'T THAT BETTER
THAN SQUATTING?

356
00:15:06,573 --> 00:15:09,159
IF YOU'VE EVER SEEN ONE
OF THOSE PLACES...

357
00:15:09,243 --> 00:15:11,411
ZIG, WHY CAN'T YOU
JUST GO BACK HOME?

358
00:15:14,289 --> 00:15:16,166
MY PARENTS KICKED ME OUT.

359
00:15:17,668 --> 00:15:19,169
OH.

360
00:15:20,587 --> 00:15:21,797
I DIDN'T KNOW.

361
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:23,549
YOU DON'T KNOW ANYTHING!

362
00:15:25,926 --> 00:15:27,427
(SIGHS HEAVILY)

363
00:15:36,103 --> 00:15:38,021
JENNA:
OH! THERE YOU ARE, CONNOR!

364
00:15:38,105 --> 00:15:38,772
I'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR YOU
EVERYWHERE TO...

365
00:15:38,856 --> 00:15:41,275
APOLOGIZE.

366
00:15:41,358 --> 00:15:42,276
CONNOR:
YOU'RE MAKING A WEIRD FACE;

367
00:15:42,359 --> 00:15:43,610
ARE YOU GONNA VOMIT
OR SOMETHING?

368
00:15:43,694 --> 00:15:46,613
NO! I...

369
00:15:46,697 --> 00:15:48,782
CONNOR,
YOU LOOK AMAZING.

370
00:15:48,866 --> 00:15:49,700
I COULD ONLY GET
MY LEFT CONTACT IN.

371
00:15:49,783 --> 00:15:50,701
MY DEPTH PERCEPTION
IS TERRIBLE,

372
00:15:50,784 --> 00:15:52,286
I KEEP TRIPPING.

373
00:15:53,745 --> 00:15:55,914
I'M SO SORRY.

374
00:15:55,998 --> 00:15:57,916
WE DON'T HAVE TO DO
THE STUPID COMPETITION.

375
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:58,834
I REALLY DON'T CARE
WHAT OTHER PEOPLE THINK.

376
00:15:58,917 --> 00:16:00,252
I ACCEPT YOUR APOLOGY,

377
00:16:00,335 --> 00:16:01,920
AND WE HAVE TO WIN
THE COMPETITION.

378
00:16:02,004 --> 00:16:04,256
BUT YOU THINK IT'S STUPID.

379
00:16:04,339 --> 00:16:05,632
YOU DON'T,
AND I'VE READ THAT COMPROMISE

380
00:16:05,716 --> 00:16:07,217
IS IMPORTANT
IN A RELATIONSHIP.

381
00:16:09,469 --> 00:16:09,845
DREW:
JENNA MIDDLETON
AND CONNOR DELAURIER,

382
00:16:09,928 --> 00:16:11,430
YOU'RE UP!

383
00:16:14,308 --> 00:16:16,059
CONNOR:
IMAGE IS AN INTEGRAL PART
OF ANY POLITICAL CAMPAIGN.

384
00:16:16,143 --> 00:16:17,227
SOME PEOPLE THINK
IT WAS A DECISIVE FACTOR

385
00:16:17,311 --> 00:16:19,521
IN JFK'S 1960 VICTORY
OVER NIXON.

386
00:16:19,605 --> 00:16:21,940
WHAT?

387
00:16:22,024 --> 00:16:23,692
YOU CAN TALK NERDY
TO ME ANYTIME.

388
00:16:26,570 --> 00:16:28,071
HUH!

389
00:16:31,033 --> 00:16:32,659
AND EVEN THOUGH
I FORGOT MY BRA,

390
00:16:32,743 --> 00:16:34,161
I GOT TO REWRITE
THE WHOLE DRESS CODE!

391
00:16:34,244 --> 00:16:36,663
YOU'RE PRETTY WEIRD,
AREN'T YOU?

392
00:16:36,747 --> 00:16:38,248
IMOGEN'S NOT WEIRD!

393
00:16:39,041 --> 00:16:40,542
IT'S A GOOD THING.

394
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:44,838
ANYWAY...

395
00:16:44,922 --> 00:16:46,006
BECKY:
UH, YOU SHOULD WASH THE CITY
OFF YOUR HANDS,

396
00:16:46,089 --> 00:16:47,591
IT'S PRETTY GROSS OUT THERE.

397
00:16:47,674 --> 00:16:48,550
UH, BATHROOM'S DOWN THE HALL.

398
00:16:48,634 --> 00:16:50,469
RIGHT. OKAY.

399
00:16:50,552 --> 00:16:52,054
BE RIGHT BACK.

400
00:16:53,722 --> 00:16:55,015
NOW I FEEL KINDA ICKY.

401
00:16:55,098 --> 00:16:55,641
I THINK I'M GONNA GO
WASH UP TOO-

402
00:16:55,724 --> 00:16:57,226
UH...

403
00:16:59,811 --> 00:17:02,606
DO YOU WANT TO GO
TO THE SEMIFORMAL WITH ME?

404
00:17:02,689 --> 00:17:04,525
FUN!
WE SHOULD INVITE JACK TOO.

405
00:17:04,608 --> 00:17:06,818
IS IT OKAY IF WE DON'T?

406
00:17:06,902 --> 00:17:08,070
I MEAN I JUST WANT
A NIGHT ALONE,

407
00:17:08,153 --> 00:17:09,446
YOU KNOW,
JUST THE TWO OF US.

408
00:17:09,530 --> 00:17:12,199
WE CAN GET TO KNOW EACH OTHER
MORE INTIMATELY.

409
00:17:12,282 --> 00:17:14,076
WOW.

410
00:17:14,159 --> 00:17:15,786
ARE YOU SURE?

411
00:17:15,869 --> 00:17:17,079
BECKY:
OH, AM I SCARING YOU?

412
00:17:17,162 --> 00:17:19,665
I'M REALLY GOOFY
WITH THIS KIND OF STUFF!

413
00:17:19,748 --> 00:17:22,668
IMOGEN:
NO, NO, NO! I SUPPOSE
WE COULD GIVE IT A TRY.

414
00:17:22,751 --> 00:17:25,963
I JUST DIDN'T KNOW
YOU FELT THAT WAY.

415
00:17:26,046 --> 00:17:28,757
YOU'RE THE MOST IMPORTANT PERSON
IN MY LIFE RIGHT NOW.

416
00:17:30,634 --> 00:17:32,135
OKAY.

417
00:17:32,970 --> 00:17:34,263
IT'S A DATE!

418
00:17:34,346 --> 00:17:35,973
A DATE?

419
00:17:36,056 --> 00:17:37,641
OH, RIGHT.

420
00:17:37,724 --> 00:17:40,018
IT'S A DATE.

421
00:17:40,102 --> 00:17:40,352
I'LL PICK YOU UP
AT SEVEN.

422
00:17:40,435 --> 00:17:41,562
OKAY!

423
00:17:41,645 --> 00:17:43,856
COOKIE TIME!

424
00:17:43,939 --> 00:17:45,440
BECKY:
BON APPETIT!

425
00:17:47,776 --> 00:17:49,278
(LAUGHS NERVOUSLY)

426
00:17:55,742 --> 00:17:59,079
I FOUND YOUR LAPTOP
IN KATIE'S ROOM.

427
00:17:59,162 --> 00:18:00,998
IT MUST'VE SLIPPED
DOWN BESIDE THE BED.

428
00:18:01,081 --> 00:18:03,750
I WAS DOING HOMEWORK
IN THERE!

429
00:18:03,834 --> 00:18:05,836
OH MY GOD,
I'M SUCH A TERRIBLE PERSON!

430
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:07,796
I ACCUSED ZIG
OF TAKING IT,

431
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:08,797
AND NOW HE'S GONNA BE
PUT IN A GROUP HOME!

432
00:18:08,881 --> 00:18:11,341
WHOA, THERE, GIRLIE.

433
00:18:11,425 --> 00:18:12,593
ACCUSING ZIG OF TAKING
THE LAPTOP WITHOUT PROOF

434
00:18:12,676 --> 00:18:14,970
WAS WRONG,

435
00:18:15,053 --> 00:18:15,804
BUT TALKING TO MS. GRELL
WASN'T!

436
00:18:15,888 --> 00:18:17,222
I DON'T KNOW, MOM.

437
00:18:17,306 --> 00:18:17,848
I'VE BEEN READING
HORROR STORIES

438
00:18:17,931 --> 00:18:19,308
ABOUT THOSE PLACES!

439
00:18:19,391 --> 00:18:20,976
THEY'RE LIKE "OLIVER,"

440
00:18:21,059 --> 00:18:22,352
BUT WITHOUT THE SINGING
AND DANCING.

441
00:18:22,436 --> 00:18:23,604
THOSE HOMES ARE EXPECTED
TO DO A LOT

442
00:18:23,687 --> 00:18:25,022
WITH VERY LIMITED RESOURCES.

443
00:18:25,105 --> 00:18:27,232
IT'S NOT FAIR!

444
00:18:27,316 --> 00:18:29,568
I WISH THERE WAS SOMETHING
WE COULD DO.

445
00:18:29,651 --> 00:18:30,694
ZIG SPENT ALL THAT TIME
HERE LAST YEAR.

446
00:18:30,777 --> 00:18:32,696
HE FELT LIKE FAMILY.

447
00:18:32,779 --> 00:18:35,324
MS. GRELL SAID...

448
00:18:35,407 --> 00:18:37,034
IF ZIG COULD FIND
A SAFE PLACE TO STAY,

449
00:18:37,117 --> 00:18:38,744
THEN SHE WOULDN'T HAVE
TO CALL CHILDREN'S AID.

450
00:18:38,827 --> 00:18:41,038
MAYA, ZIG CAN'T LIVE
WITH US.

451
00:18:41,121 --> 00:18:43,373
EVEN IF IT'S ONLY
FOR A FEW WEEKS?

452
00:18:48,545 --> 00:18:50,881
ALLI:
I HAVE TO ADMIT
YOU GUYS LOOK GOOD.

453
00:18:52,132 --> 00:18:54,801
WE LOOK GREAT!
WE'RE GONNA WIN THIS THING.

454
00:18:54,885 --> 00:18:56,553
WELL, CONNOR DEFINITELY
HAS THE YOUTH VOTE.

455
00:19:00,432 --> 00:19:01,934
FRANKIE:
BYE!

456
00:19:03,101 --> 00:19:05,771
HEY, WHO ARE
YOUR NEW FRIENDS?

457
00:19:05,854 --> 00:19:06,396
THEY'RE NOT MY FRIENDS,
THEY'RE JUST SOME GRADE NINES

458
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,232
WHO WANT MATH HELP.

459
00:19:08,315 --> 00:19:10,484
WELL, WHEN DID THEY ASK YOU,
LIKE LAST WEEK?

460
00:19:10,567 --> 00:19:12,069
NO, JUST NOW.

461
00:19:13,445 --> 00:19:14,947
AFTER YOUR MAKEOVER.

462
00:19:16,406 --> 00:19:17,908
ALLI:
HUH. WHAT A COINCIDENCE.

463
00:19:21,912 --> 00:19:23,413
(BELL RINGS)

464
00:19:25,999 --> 00:19:27,626
MS. GRELL:
THE POINT OF THIS EXERCISE
IS TO TRUST YOUR PARTNER ENOUGH

465
00:19:27,709 --> 00:19:30,295
TO LET THEM CATCH YOU.

466
00:19:30,379 --> 00:19:32,506
SO GO AHEAD,
AND WHEN I SAY SO, SWITCH.

467
00:19:34,925 --> 00:19:36,426
DROP ME AND DIE,
GRACE.

468
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:39,721
(SIGHS HEAVILY)

469
00:19:41,056 --> 00:19:42,558
HI.

470
00:19:44,268 --> 00:19:45,018
ZIG, I DIDN'T KNOW
WHAT WOULD HAPPEN

471
00:19:45,102 --> 00:19:46,478
WHEN I TALKED
TO MS. GRELL.

472
00:19:46,562 --> 00:19:47,521
YOU SHOULD'VE JUST
STAYED OUT OF IT!

473
00:19:47,604 --> 00:19:49,898
I KNOW, AND I'M SORRY,
BUT I WANNA HELP!

474
00:19:49,982 --> 00:19:50,899
MS. GRELL:
AND SWITCH!

475
00:19:50,983 --> 00:19:52,484
WELL, YOU CAN'T.

476
00:19:53,402 --> 00:19:54,903
YES, I CAN.

477
00:19:54,987 --> 00:19:56,071
YOU SAID IF YOU HAD
A PLACE TO STAY,

478
00:19:56,154 --> 00:19:57,406
THEN MS. GRELL WOULDN'T
CALL CHILDREN'S AID!

479
00:19:57,489 --> 00:19:59,157
RIGHT. BUT I DON'T,
SO SHE WILL.

480
00:19:59,241 --> 00:20:02,661
BUT YOU DO HAVE
A PLACE TO STAY.

481
00:20:02,744 --> 00:20:05,330
WHAT, YOUR NEW RICH BOYFRIEND
IS GONNA SPRING FOR A SUITE?

482
00:20:05,414 --> 00:20:07,207
MS. GRELL:
LESS CHATTING, MORE FALLING!

483
00:20:07,291 --> 00:20:10,127
NO, BUT MY SISTER'S AWAY
AT COLLEGE,

484
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:13,797
SO THERE'S AN EXTRA ROOM
AT MY HOUSE.

485
00:20:13,881 --> 00:20:16,175
(MAYA CRASHES ON FLOOR)
OOF!

486
00:20:16,258 --> 00:20:17,176
YOUR MOM WOULD NEVER
SAY YES!

487
00:20:17,259 --> 00:20:18,886
MAYA:
SHE ALREADY DID.

488
00:20:18,969 --> 00:20:20,470
IT TOOK SOME CONVINCING.

489
00:20:24,975 --> 00:20:29,479
ALSO, THERE ARE RULES:

492
00:20:38,739 --> 00:20:40,532
SO... WHAT DO YOU SAY?
HOUSEMATES?

493
00:20:42,492 --> 00:20:44,870
(LAUGHS)

494
00:20:44,953 --> 00:20:46,538
