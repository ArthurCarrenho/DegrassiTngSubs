THEY'RE CLASSIC.
LIKE WE TALKED ABOUT.

26
00:00:57,516 --> 00:00:59,142
CLASSIC IS JUST BORING
WEARING A TUXEDO.

27
00:00:59,226 --> 00:01:00,894
I NEED TO CHANGE THEM.

28
00:01:00,978 --> 00:01:02,604

SO THEY'RE A TEENSY BIT MORE
HAUTE-COUTURE.

35

00:12:51,855 --> 00:12:52,648
ACTUALLY, I WANNA TALK TO YOU
ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE.

346
00:12:52,731 --> 00:12:54,525
LOOK, FRANKIE,
I DON'T HAVE TIME.

347
00:12:54,608 --> 00:12:56,235
DID MY MOM PAY YOU
TO GIVE ME A MODELLING SPOT?

348
00:12:56,318 --> 00:12:57,986
WHAT? OF COURSE NOT.

349
00:12:58,070 --> 00:13:00,239
I WOULD NEVER ACCEPT
A BRIBE!

350
00:13:00,322 --> 00:13:03,742
THEN WHY DID YOU CHANGE
YOUR MIND ALL OF A SUDDEN?

351
00:13:03,825 --> 00:13:06,620
WINSTON SAID HE'D ONLY SHOOT
THE SHOW FOR DTV

352
00:13:06,703 --> 00:13:08,121
IF YOU WEREN'T IN IT.

353
00:13:08,205 --> 00:13:09,748
HE DID WHAT?!

354
00:13:09,831 --> 00:13:10,791
HE SAID SOMETHING ABOUT
IT BEING IMPOSSIBLE

355
00:13:10,874 --> 00:13:13,001
TO BE AROUND YOU.

356
00:13:13,085 --> 00:13:15,128
AND YOU AGREED?
I DID, AT FIRST.

357
00:13:15,212 --> 00:13:16,713
BUT THEN I FELT BAD,

358
00:13:16,797 --> 00:13:18,340
ESPECIALLY 'CAUSE
YOU WERE SO GOOD!

359
00:13:18,423 --> 00:13:19,508
WHICH IS WHY
I CHANGED MY MIND.

360
00:13:19,591 --> 00:13:22,261
I JUST MADE WINSTON
FILM IT ANYWAY.

361
00:13:22,344 --> 00:13:24,721
LOOK, I REALLY NEED TO GO.
BREAK LEGS OUT THERE!

362
00:13:31,854 --> 00:13:33,605
WHY AREN'T YOU
IN THE GYM?

363
00:13:33,689 --> 00:13:35,357
TRISTAN:
I NEED YOU M.C.
THE FASHION SHOW FOR ME.

364
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,860
WHAT? NO, I CAN'T!
BECKY'S MAD AT ME!

365
00:13:37,943 --> 00:13:39,820
OKAY, WELL, I CAN'T DO IT.
SOMETHING'S COME UP.

366
00:13:39,903 --> 00:13:41,238
BECKY SAID I WAN'T SUPPOSED
TO LEAVE THIS SPOT

367
00:13:41,321 --> 00:13:41,780
AND SHE WAS VERY FIRM
ABOUT IT.

368
00:13:41,864 --> 00:13:43,115
YOU'LL BE AWESOME.

369
00:13:43,198 --> 00:13:44,867

I DON'T WANNA
MAKE THINGS WORSE.

372
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:49,705
MAYBE THIS IS YOUR CHANCE
TO REDEEM YOURSELF!

373
00:13:49,788 --> 00:13:51,540
YOU'LL BE STEPPING UP
IN A MOMENT OF CRISIS!

374
00:13:51,623 --> 00:13:53,834
YOU'LL BE EVERYONE'S HERO.
GOOD? GOOD!

375
00:13:53,917 --> 00:13:55,419

YOU'RE THE BEST!

385
00:14:24,406 --> 00:14:25,699
BEFORE WE BEGIN,
I'D LIKE TO SAY A FEW WORDS...

386
00:14:25,782 --> 00:14:28,535
ABOUT...

387
00:14:28,619 --> 00:14:31,538
FASHION.

388
00:14:31,622 --> 00:14:35,167
SOMETIMES, IN FASHION,
WE TAKE RISKS,

389
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:37,961
AND SOMETIMES THOSE RISKS
PAY OFF.

390
00:14:38,045 --> 00:14:39,546
BUT SOMETIMES THEY DON'T,

391
00:14:43,383 --> 00:14:45,844
AND THEN PEOPLE THAT ARE
MOST IMPORTANT TO FASHION

392
00:14:45,928 --> 00:14:49,598
ARE MAD AT FASHION
FOR DOING A DUMB THING.

393
00:14:49,681 --> 00:14:52,476
BUT MAYBE FASHION ONLY DID IT
BECAUSE FASHION FELT INSECURE.

394
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:54,228
BUT NOW FASHION IS REALLY,
REALLY SORRY...

395
00:14:58,023 --> 00:14:59,816
AND FASHION JUST CARES
ABOUT PEOPLE

396
00:15:03,445 --> 00:15:07,783
AND WOULD BE HEARTBROKEN
IF THEY COULDN'T FORGIVE IT

397
00:15:07,866 --> 00:15:09,368
FOR BEING
AN INCONSIDERATE IDIOT.

398
00:15:15,290 --> 00:15:18,710

THE MODELS!

TALKING TO?!

(SIGHS) NOT COOL.

405
00:15:43,485 --> 00:15:44,987

I WAS UGLY.

WHAT?! NO!

YOU'RE BEAUTIFUL!

WANNA AVOID ME?!

JUST LIKED ME BACK
OR NOT!

514
00:20:10,544 --> 00:20:11,545
YOU CAN HAVE THAT.
I WANT YOU TO HAVE THAT.

515
00:20:11,628 --> 00:20:13,547
BUT NOT...
NOT WITH HIM!

516
00:20:13,630 --> 00:20:17,009
YOU GET TO HAVE A MILLION GUYS
IN LOVE WITH YOU

517
00:20:17,092 --> 00:20:18,844
AND A PERFECT HOME,
NO!

518
00:20:18,927 --> 00:20:21,388
AND I JUST WANTED THIS ONE,
ONE GOOD THING.

519
00:20:23,682 --> 00:20:27,102
BUT YOU, OF ALL PEOPLE,
RUINED IT FOR ME.

520
00:20:27,186 --> 00:20:28,937
NO, IT'S NOT LIKE THAT!

521
00:20:29,021 --> 00:20:30,397
TRISTAN, PLEASE!
I LOVE YOU!

522
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:33,567
NO, I DON'T WANNA
HEAR IT!

523
00:20:33,650 --> 00:20:35,777
I DON'T WANT TO TALK TO YOU
EVER AGAIN.

524
00:20:38,405 --> 00:20:39,907
WHAT?

525
00:20:44,536 --> 00:20:46,205
