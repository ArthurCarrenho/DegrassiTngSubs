INCLUDING MR. SIMPSON,

346
00:13:24,513 --> 00:13:28,016
WHO'S GONNA BE REALLY,
REALLY MAD!

347
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:30,561
DO YOU THINK GANDHI WORRIED
ABOUT RUFFLING A FEW FEATHERS?

348
00:13:30,644 --> 00:13:32,646
NO, BUT HE ALSO SPENT
TEN YEARS IN PRISON.

349
00:13:32,729 --> 00:13:34,106
SIMPSON CAN'T ARREST ME.

350
00:13:34,189 --> 00:13:37,776
YEAH, BUT HE CAN
SUSPEND YOU!

351
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:41,572
NO, WE'RE AIRING IT;
THAT'S WHAT GANDHI WOULD DO.

352
00:13:41,655 --> 00:13:43,657
MAYBE THOUGH,
IN A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT OUTFIT.

353
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:45,242
(LAUGHS)

354
00:13:50,622 --> 00:13:51,790
MR. SIMPSON: (ON P.A.)
THE BEAKERS AND TEST TUBES
IN THE SCIENCE LAB

355
00:13:51,874 --> 00:13:53,333
ARE USED
FOR DANGEROUS CHEMICALS.

356
00:13:53,417 --> 00:13:56,545
THEY ARE NOT USED FOR BEVERAGES
FOR CONSUMPTION.

357
00:13:56,628 --> 00:13:58,297
HEY, HAVE YOU SEEN JENNA?

358
00:13:58,380 --> 00:14:00,424
BLONDE,
ABOUT YAY TALL,

359
00:14:00,507 --> 00:14:01,925
NEVER MET A CURLING IRON
SHE DIDN'T LIKE?

360
00:14:02,009 --> 00:14:03,802
YOU'RE INCORRIGIBLE.

361
00:14:03,886 --> 00:14:05,929
ALSO AVAILABLE.
MAYBE I CAN HELP.

362
00:14:06,013 --> 00:14:08,515
IF IT'S GIRL TALK, YOU KNOW,
I CAN TOTALLY DO THAT.

363
00:14:08,599 --> 00:14:10,309
TEMPTING,
BUT I DON'T NEED A GOSSIP SESH,

364
00:14:10,392 --> 00:14:12,019
I NEED A LAB ASSISTANT.

365
00:14:12,102 --> 00:14:13,562
PERFECT!
I LOVE SCIENCE.

366
00:14:13,645 --> 00:14:15,856
OH YEAH?
SINCE WHEN?

367
00:14:15,939 --> 00:14:17,441
ABOUT UH...
TEN SECONDS AGO.

368
00:14:19,193 --> 00:14:22,529
HEY, I GOT YOUR 911 TEXT.
DID YOU GET ANY NEWS?

369
00:14:22,613 --> 00:14:24,948
ABOUT MY MUGGER?
UH, NO.

370
00:14:25,032 --> 00:14:26,325
IT'S ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE.

371
00:14:26,408 --> 00:14:27,910
ADIOS, LADIES.

372
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:31,496
OKAY, SO APPARENTLY,
IT'S LIKE IMPOSSIBLE

373
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:33,457
TO DO A SCIENCE EXPERIMENT
WITH ONE HAND,

374
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:34,708
AND I KNOW-
OH, OF COURSE
I'LL HELP!

375
00:14:34,791 --> 00:14:36,210
WHEN DO WE START?

376
00:14:36,293 --> 00:14:37,794
NOW WOULD BE GOOD?

377
00:14:40,631 --> 00:14:41,507
GIRL:
THIS IS GREAT!
YEAH, TOTALLY!

378
00:14:41,590 --> 00:14:43,091
LOOK! THOSE GIRLS
GOT MY MESSAGE!

379
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:48,180
I DON'T THINK
SHE QUITE GOT YOUR MESSAGE.

380
00:14:48,263 --> 00:14:51,600
I CAN LIVE WITH THAT,
IT'S JUST ONE GIRL.

381
00:14:51,683 --> 00:14:54,311
ONE GIRL IN ONLY HER BRA
IS ONE GIRL TOO MANY.

382
00:14:54,394 --> 00:14:55,521
THIS IS AMAZING.

383
00:14:55,604 --> 00:14:57,397
THE REVOLUTION HAS BEGUN!

384
00:14:57,481 --> 00:14:58,982
SIMPSON HAS TO SEE
MY POINT.

385
00:15:01,235 --> 00:15:02,069
WELL, HE SURE SEES SOMETHING.

386
00:15:02,152 --> 00:15:03,654
(SIGHS)

387
00:15:05,155 --> 00:15:06,698
YOU MUST BE PLEASED
WITH YOURSELF.

388
00:15:06,782 --> 00:15:08,617
I'D BE LYING
IF I SAID I WASN'T, SIR.

389
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:09,159
MR. SIMPSON:
UH-HUH. YOU THINK THIS
IS A VICTORY,

390
00:15:09,243 --> 00:15:10,202
BUT IT'S NOT.

391
00:15:10,285 --> 00:15:12,913
IT'S OVER, IMOGEN.

392
00:15:12,996 --> 00:15:14,373
DON'T YOU WANT TO BARGAIN?
I THOUGHT YOU CAME TO TALK.

393
00:15:14,456 --> 00:15:15,666
NO, I CAME TO TAKE.

394
00:15:15,749 --> 00:15:17,584
TAKE WHAT?

395
00:15:17,668 --> 00:15:19,962
YOUR BROADCAST PRIVILEGES.
YOU ARE OFF THE AIRWAVES.

396
00:15:20,045 --> 00:15:21,547
YOU MUST BE JOKING!

397
00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:22,965
BECKY:
UM, I THINK
HE'S PRETTY SERIOUS.

398
00:15:23,048 --> 00:15:24,341
NO, I KNOW WHEN HE'S SERIOUS

399
00:15:24,424 --> 00:15:26,844
'CAUSE HE PUTS THAT
SERIOUS FACE... ON.

400
00:15:26,927 --> 00:15:29,304
YEP, THAT ONE.

401
00:15:29,388 --> 00:15:31,139
AS OF THIS VERY SECOND,
DEGRASSI TV IS OFF THE AIRWAVES.

402
00:15:31,223 --> 00:15:32,182
YOU CAN'T DO THAT!

403
00:15:32,266 --> 00:15:33,851
I CAN AND I AM!

404
00:15:33,934 --> 00:15:36,061
WHAT ABOUT FREEDOM
OF THE PRESS?

405
00:15:36,144 --> 00:15:36,562
MR. SIMPSON:
SOMEHOW, I DON'T THINK THIS
IS WHAT THE FOUNDING FATHERS

406
00:15:36,645 --> 00:15:38,146
HAD IN MIND.

407
00:15:44,444 --> 00:15:45,946

408
00:15:52,035 --> 00:15:53,537
GUYS, UM...
I'M REALLY SORRY.

409
00:15:56,123 --> 00:15:57,791
WHAT NOW, ARE YOU DITCHING US
FOR A GRADE NINE PARTY?

410
00:15:57,875 --> 00:15:59,626
NO, NO,
OF COURSE NOT.

GOT YOU ROPED INTO NOW?

412
00:16:01,712 --> 00:16:03,630

WELL, I COULDN'T SAY NO!

416
00:16:07,384 --> 00:16:09,761
WHY? WHAT MAGIC SPELL
DOES THIS GIRL HAVE OVER YOU?

417
00:16:11,430 --> 00:16:12,472
THEY HAD SEX!

418
00:16:12,556 --> 00:16:14,141
YOU HAD SEX WITH-

419
00:16:14,224 --> 00:16:16,602
SHHH! OKAY?
SHE'S GONNA BE HERE ANY SECOND!

420
00:16:16,685 --> 00:16:18,020
CONNOR:
BUT YOU SAID YOU WERE CASUAL;
THAT DOESN'T SOUND VERY CASUAL.

421
00:16:18,103 --> 00:16:20,105
GUYS, OKAY,
IT'S JUST SEX, OKAY?!

422
00:16:20,189 --> 00:16:22,566

00:16:22,649 --> 00:16:23,734
DALLAS:
SO IS SHE COMING TO PROM
WITH US AS WELL OR-?

424
00:16:23,817 --> 00:16:25,861
IT'S NOT LIKE THAT.

425
00:16:25,944 --> 00:16:26,695
CONNOR:
HAS SHE CHANGED HER FACERANGE
RELATIONSHIP STATUS?

426
00:16:26,778 --> 00:16:29,156
NO, BECAUSE IT'S JUST CASUAL!

427
00:16:29,239 --> 00:16:29,907
DALLAS:
AND IF WE ASKED HER,
SHE'D SAY THAT?

428
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:31,867
YEAH!

429
00:16:31,950 --> 00:16:33,452
HEY, EVERYONE!

430
00:16:34,745 --> 00:16:36,246
WHOA! THIS GAME IS SERIOUS!

00:16:43,962 --> 00:16:46,423
I THINK THIS GAME JUST GOT
A LOT MORE INTERESTING.

00:16:53,305 --> 00:16:55,766
HE IS. VERY.

440
00:16:55,849 --> 00:16:57,351
UH, CLARE,

SPEND A LOT OF TIME TOGETHER.

00:18:00,873 --> 00:18:01,957
I KNOW IT'S UNCHRISTIAN
TO SAY I TOLD YOU SO,

THIS IS OVER.

472
00:18:11,633 --> 00:18:13,343
THERE'S NOT A SINGLE THING
IN HERE ABOUT BOYS' ATTIRE!

473
00:18:13,427 --> 00:18:14,970
IT DOESN'T SPECIFICALLY
SAY GIRLS EITHER!

474
00:18:15,053 --> 00:18:16,930
IT DOESN'T HAVE TO.

475
00:18:17,014 --> 00:18:18,432

"NO YOGA PANTS."

WHY GIRLS WEAR THOSE TO SCHOOL.

479
00:18:23,478 --> 00:18:26,106
I MEAN THEY'RE FOR YOGA,

480
00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:27,816

THESE RESTRICTIONS.

482
00:18:28,567 --> 00:18:29,818

483
00:18:29,902 --> 00:18:31,403

YOU LIKED ME.

508
00:19:32,297 --> 00:19:33,924
I THOUGHT YOU WERE A NICE GUY,
BUT YOU USED ME!

DO THAT TO YOU!

510
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:36,760

YOUR FIRST TIME?

516
00:19:52,442 --> 00:19:53,944
LIKE IN A POOL HOUSE?

517
00:20:00,033 --> 00:20:01,535
JEEZ!

518
00:20:03,787 --> 00:20:04,913
WHY WOULDN'T YOU
TELL ME?

519
00:20:04,997 --> 00:20:06,832
I DIDN'T WANT
TO RUIN THE MOMENT.

520
00:20:06,915 --> 00:20:07,875
I THOUGHT IT WAS SPECIAL.

521
00:20:07,958 --> 00:20:09,376
IT WAS SPECIAL!

522
00:20:09,459 --> 00:20:10,752
BUT YOU WANT TO THROW IT
ALL AWAY?

523
00:20:10,836 --> 00:20:12,337
THAT IS NOT WHAT I MEANT!

524
00:20:13,505 --> 00:20:14,965
THEN...

525
00:20:15,048 --> 00:20:17,009
WHAT DO YOU WANNA
TALK ABOUT?

526
00:20:20,596 --> 00:20:24,808
I THINK WE SHOULD...

527
00:20:24,892 --> 00:20:26,518
WE SHOULD CHANGE
OUR FACERANGE STATUS

528
00:20:26,602 --> 00:20:29,521
TO "IN A RELATIONSHIP."

529
00:20:29,605 --> 00:20:31,023

530
00:20:31,106 --> 00:20:32,649
REALLY?

531
00:20:32,733 --> 00:20:34,234
REALLY.

532
00:20:36,069 --> 00:20:37,571
I FEEL SO SILLY!

533
00:20:40,949 --> 00:20:42,451
ME TOO.
