176
00:06:26,553 --> 00:06:29,139
NO, NO, IT NEEDS TO BE DONE

177
00:06:29,223 --> 00:06:30,724
OKAY.

178
00:06:32,017 --> 00:06:34,102
CAN I CALL YOU BACK?

00:06:34,186 --> 00:06:35,687
YEAH. OKAY, BYE.

TRISTAN:
I SEE THEIR KNAVERY:

181
00:06:38,899 --> 00:06:41,902
THIS IS TO MAKE AN ASS OF ME;
TO FRIGHT ME, IF THEY COULD.

182
00:06:41,985 --> 00:06:43,403
BUT I WILL NOT STIR
FROM THIS PLACE,

183
00:06:43,487 --> 00:06:44,988

00:06:50,827 --> 00:06:52,496
DON'T LAUGH.

187
00:06:52,579 --> 00:06:55,249

YES, BECAUSE MR. TOWNSEND THINKS
THE ONLY THING I CAN PLAY

189
00:06:56,917 --> 00:06:58,418
IS AN ASS.

190
00:07:00,128 --> 00:07:02,464
NOT THAT I CARE,
BUT WHAT MONOLOGUE DID ZOA GET?

191
00:07:02,548 --> 00:07:04,383
THE ONE SHE WANTED.

192
00:07:04,466 --> 00:07:07,135
MEANWHILE, TOWNSEND SAID
I WAS "FLAMBOYANT."

193
00:07:07,219 --> 00:07:10,389
YOU KNOW HOW THEY SPELL THAT?
G-A-Y.

194
00:07:10,472 --> 00:07:12,933
HE THINKS
I CAN'T HANDLE DRAMA.

195
00:07:13,016 --> 00:07:14,685

SO WHY DON'T YOU JUST GIVE HIM
A PIECE OF YOUR MIND?

196
00:07:14,768 --> 00:07:17,479
YOU KNOW,
LIKE MAYA DID TO ZOA.

197
00:07:17,563 --> 00:07:19,064
AND GET SUSPENDED
AND PUT UNDER HOUSE ARREST?

198
00:07:19,147 --> 00:07:21,024
COME ON, TRIS!

199
00:07:21,108 --> 00:07:23,986

204
00:07:35,873 --> 00:07:37,374
