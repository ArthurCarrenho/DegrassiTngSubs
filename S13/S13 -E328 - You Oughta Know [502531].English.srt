ON THE POST-MILLENNIAL
GENERATION.

00:00:11,136 --> 00:00:12,804
THIS ISN'T OFFICIAL
STUDENT COUNCIL BUSINESS, IS IT?

7
00:00:12,888 --> 00:00:13,555
I HAVE A MEETING
WITH THE EDITOR

8
00:00:13,639 --> 00:00:15,265
OF "MUSE" MAGAZINE TODAY!

9
00:00:15,349 --> 00:00:16,642
NEVER HEARD OF IT.

10
00:00:16,725 --> 00:00:17,935
IT'S A VERY PRESTIGIOUS
MAGAZINE!

11
00:00:18,018 --> 00:00:19,102
I SENT THE EDITOR,
MEREDITH FOX,

12
00:00:19,186 --> 00:00:20,312
MY PITCH
AND MY PORTFOLIO

13
00:00:20,395 --> 00:00:21,146
AND SHE ASKED ME
TO COME IN,

14
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:22,731
SO AM I READY?

15
00:00:24,191 --> 00:00:25,692
IT'S A LITTLE BIT
UM...

16
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:28,779
BORING?

17
00:00:28,862 --> 00:00:31,448
BUT IT'S JUST-
IT'S NOT UP MY ALLEY.

18
00:00:31,532 --> 00:00:32,866
AND WHICH ALLEY
WOULD THAT BE?

19
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:35,035
EXPLODING CARS?
GIRLS IN BIKINIS?

20
00:00:35,118 --> 00:00:36,537
YES, YES, DO THAT ONE!

21
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:38,372
DON'T LISTEN TO HIM,
IT'S GREAT.

22
00:00:38,455 --> 00:00:40,374
VERY IMPORTANT STUFF.

23
00:00:40,457 --> 00:00:41,458
DID YOU KNOW
THAT YOUTH UNEMPLOYMENT

24
00:00:41,542 --> 00:00:43,210
IS UP TO 64 PERCENT
IN THAT...

25
00:00:44,336 --> 00:00:47,256
UM, IN-IN THAT PLACE?

26
00:00:47,339 --> 00:00:48,966
YOU KNOW, WITH THE COLUMNS,
AND THE OLIVES...

27
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:50,259
DO YOU MEAN GREECE?

28
00:00:50,342 --> 00:00:52,135
YES! YEAH, YEAH,
THAT'S IT.

29
00:00:52,219 --> 00:00:53,846
IS SHE OKAY?

30
00:00:53,929 --> 00:00:54,763
SHE'S NOT USUALLY
AT A LOSS FOR WORDS.

31
00:00:54,847 --> 00:00:57,766
IT MUST BE NERVES.

32
00:00:57,850 --> 00:00:59,768

178
00:06:23,967 --> 00:06:25,928
"WEST DRIVE?"
THAT'S THE ONE!

179
00:06:26,011 --> 00:06:26,720
BUT HER CELEBRITY
DOESN'T SEEM TO BE

180
00:06:26,803 --> 00:06:28,138
HELPING HER AT SCHOOL,

181
00:06:28,222 --> 00:06:29,723
SHE SEEMS... LOST,
LONELY.

182
00:06:31,892 --> 00:06:33,435
LOVED BY FANS,
LIKED BY NO ONE?

183
00:06:33,519 --> 00:06:35,812
YOU'VE GOT IT.

184
00:06:35,896 --> 00:06:37,773
ALL RIGHT,
I LIKE THE SOUND OF THIS.

185
00:06:37,856 --> 00:06:38,440
ONE OF THE FEATURES
FOR OUR NEXT ISSUE

186
00:06:38,524 --> 00:06:40,025
ISN'T WORKING OUT,

187
00:06:40,108 --> 00:06:43,403
AND I'VE BEEN LOOKING
FOR A REPLACEMENT.

188
00:06:43,487 --> 00:06:44,488
THAT WOULD BE AMAZING!

189
00:06:44,571 --> 00:06:46,156
GREAT.

190
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,783
THE TURNAROUND

191
00:06:47,866 --> 00:06:49,868
COULD YOU GET ME A DRAFT

193
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:53,121
I KNOW IT'S ZERO NOTICE,
BUT HEY,

194
00:06:53,205 --> 00:06:54,498
WELCOME TO
THE MAGAZINE BUSINESS.

195
00:06:54,581 --> 00:06:55,958
THANKS SO MUCH
FOR THE OPPORTUNITY.

196
00:06:56,041 --> 00:06:58,502

TOO LONG HAVE
WE BEEN HELD HOSTAGE

198
00:06:59,837 --> 00:07:01,922
BY THE TYRANNY
OF THE POTATO CHIP.

199
00:07:02,005 --> 00:07:03,590
WE MUST OPEN OUR MINDS
TO ALTERNATE SNACK FOODS

200
00:07:03,674 --> 00:07:05,175
AND BE A FREE SOCIETY!

201
00:07:06,301 --> 00:07:09,179
FOR DEGRASSI TV,
I'M WINSTON CHU.

202
00:07:09,263 --> 00:07:11,056
OKAY...
UM, WE'LL GET BACK TO YOU.

203
00:07:17,062 --> 00:07:18,564
WE'VE WATCHED
OVER THIRTY AUDITIONS

204
00:07:18,647 --> 00:07:19,565
AND THEY'VE ALL
BEEN TERRIBLE!

205
00:07:19,648 --> 00:07:22,401
I'M NEVER GONNA FIND
AN ANCHOR!

206
00:07:22,484 --> 00:07:25,279
HI! I HOPE I'M NOT TOO LATE
TO AUDITION.

207
00:07:25,362 --> 00:07:26,697
NO, BECKY, JUST IN TIME.
TAKE A SEAT.

208
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:28,282
BECKY:
OKAY!

209
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:32,494
OKAY, WHENEVER YOU'RE READY.

210
00:07:32,578 --> 00:07:34,663
UM, I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT
I WAS SUPPOSED TO PREPARE,

211
00:07:34,746 --> 00:07:37,249
SO I JUST WROTE ABOUT SOMETHING
THAT'S BEEN ON MY MIND.

212
00:07:37,332 --> 00:07:38,834
IMOGEN: AND... ACTION!
BECKY: OKAY.

213
00:07:41,378 --> 00:07:43,797
A NEW STUDY REVEALS
THAT TEXTING AND DRIVING

214
00:07:43,881 --> 00:07:46,383
IS THE LEADING CAUSE
OF CAR ACCIDENTS AMONG TEENS.

215
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:48,427
WE NEED TO EDUCATE PEOPLE
SO NO MORE FAMILIES AND FRIENDS

216
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:50,470
HAVE THEIR LOVED ONES
RIPPED AWAY FROM THEM.

217
00:07:50,554 --> 00:07:53,348
BECAUSE IN A SECOND,
YOUR ENTIRE LIFE CAN CHANGE.

218
00:07:53,432 --> 00:07:55,350
FOR DEGRASSI TV,
I'M BECKY BAKER.

BECKY KILLED THAT!

226
00:08:11,742 --> 00:08:13,243
SHE'S TOO PERKY.

227
00:08:15,078 --> 00:08:17,039
THIS ISN'T ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED
WITH YOU AND ADAM, IS IT?

228
00:08:17,122 --> 00:08:19,833
NO! I JUST DON'T THINK
SHE'S THE RIGHT FIT.

229
00:08:19,917 --> 00:08:21,418

I'M IMOGEN MORENO.

230

00:08:29,718 --> 00:08:30,677
SHE WANTS THE ARTICLE

232
00:08:30,761 --> 00:08:32,054
I'M SORRY, WHEN?

233
00:08:32,137 --> 00:08:32,888
HOW AM I GONNA
PULL THIS OFF?

234
00:08:32,971 --> 00:08:34,640
I CAN BARELY
THINK STRAIGHT!

235
00:08:34,723 --> 00:08:36,475

AT A HUNDRED PERCENT?

236
00:08:36,558 --> 00:08:38,435
I'M JUST EXHAUSTED
AND STRESSED.

237
00:08:38,519 --> 00:08:40,103
WELL, IF YOU'RE SO
FREAKED OUT,

238
00:08:40,187 --> 00:08:41,605
WHY DID YOU SAY YES?
BECAUSE THIS IS A CHANCE
TO GET PUBLISHED

239
00:08:41,688 --> 00:08:44,483
IN A NATIONAL MAGAZINE!

240
00:08:44,566 --> 00:08:45,943

NO ONE BRINGS YOU A LATTE
UNLESS THEY WANT SOMETHING BIG.

248
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:11,260
I'M WRITING AN ARTICLE.
A FEATURE.

ABOUT ME?
YES.

250
00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:15,347
OKAY, I'LL DO IT.
WOW! THAT WAS EASY.

251
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:16,640
MY AGENT WOULD KILL ME

252
00:09:16,723 --> 00:09:18,141
IF I TURNED DOWN
FREE PUBLICITY.

253
00:09:18,225 --> 00:09:20,143

SO WHEN YOU FAINTED
FROM THE EXCITEMENT

366
00:14:06,722 --> 00:14:08,140
OF MEETING ZOE
FOR THE FIRST TIME-

367

WHEN ZOE DUMPED HIM

376
00:14:26,366 --> 00:14:28,202
THAT HE STOPPED SPEAKING
FOR TWO WEEKS?

377
00:14:28,285 --> 00:14:31,163
