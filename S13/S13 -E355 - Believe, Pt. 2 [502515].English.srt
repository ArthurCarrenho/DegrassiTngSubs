00:15:40,649 --> 00:15:42,442
COUNSEL,
PLEASE APPROACH THE BENCH.

347
00:15:46,446 --> 00:15:47,990
ZOE:
I'M SORRY, MOM.

348
00:15:48,073 --> 00:15:49,366
MS. RIVAS:
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?

349
00:15:49,449 --> 00:15:49,950
YOU DIDN'T ANSWER
ANY OF MY CALLS,

350
00:15:50,033 --> 00:15:51,159
I WAS SO WORRIED!

351
00:15:51,243 --> 00:15:53,662
I DIDN'T THINK
I COULD DO IT.

352
00:15:53,745 --> 00:15:56,915
I'M JUST GLAD YOU'RE SAFE.

353
00:15:56,999 --> 00:15:59,751
JUDGE SANDERS:
ALL RIGHT, LET'S CONTINUE.

354
00:15:59,835 --> 00:16:01,753
ZOE, I AM GOING TO PERMIT
YOUR STATEMENT.

355
00:16:13,223 --> 00:16:14,725
I'M A MESS.

356
00:16:17,853 --> 00:16:19,563
BUT YOU ALREADY KNOW THAT.

357
00:16:22,232 --> 00:16:23,734
YOU'VE SPENT THE LAST DAY

358
00:16:23,817 --> 00:16:27,321
LISTENING TO PEOPLE SAY
TERRIBLE THINGS ABOUT ME,

359
00:16:27,404 --> 00:16:28,906
AND I DON'T BLAME THEM.

360
00:16:31,241 --> 00:16:34,286
I'VE MADE A LOT OF BAD CHOICES

361
00:16:34,369 --> 00:16:36,580
AND I'M PROBABLY GOING
TO MAKE A LOT MORE.

362
00:16:40,125 --> 00:16:42,586
BUT I DID NOT CHOOSE
TO BE SEXUALLY ASSAULTED.

363
00:16:45,631 --> 00:16:48,050
IF YOU DON'T CONVICT
LUKE BAKER

364
00:16:48,133 --> 00:16:50,594
AND NEIL MARTIN TODAY,

365
00:16:50,677 --> 00:16:54,348
THEN YOU'RE SAYING
I DESERVED IT,

366
00:16:54,431 --> 00:16:57,142
AND YOU'RE SAYING TO OTHER
GIRLS AND BOYS

367
00:16:57,226 --> 00:16:58,727
THAT THEY'LL DESERVE IT, TOO.

368
00:17:02,523 --> 00:17:04,024
WELL, THEY DON'T,

369
00:17:05,526 --> 00:17:07,027
AND I DON'T.

370
00:17:11,573 --> 00:17:14,535
I'M NOT SURE I WANT TO LIVE
IN A WORLD WHERE THAT'S TRUE.

371
00:17:21,959 --> 00:17:23,460
ZIG:
HEY.

372
00:17:25,754 --> 00:17:28,257
YOU WERE GREAT UP THERE.

373
00:17:28,340 --> 00:17:32,052
NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS,
YOU SHOULD BE PROUD.

374
00:17:32,135 --> 00:17:33,887
I COULDN'T HAVE DONE IT
WITHOUT YOU.

375
00:17:33,971 --> 00:17:37,599
YOU SAVED MY LIFE.
LITERALLY.

376
00:17:37,683 --> 00:17:39,977
WHICH IS WHY I WANT YOU
TO HAVE THIS.

I'M GETTING A FRESH START,
YOU DESERVE ONE TOO.

381
00:17:52,322 --> 00:17:53,824
YOU KNOW
IT'S NOT THAT EASY.

382
00:17:55,659 --> 00:17:58,495
A WISE MAN ONCE SAID,

383
00:17:58,579 --> 00:18:01,874
YOU CAN START BY GETTING RID
OF THOSE PILLS.

384
00:18:01,957 --> 00:18:04,001

FOR THAT CRAP?

THEIR DELIBERATION,

390

TWO QUESTIONS TO ANSWER:

391

WAS ZOE TOO DRUNK
TO CONSENT TO SEXUAL RELATIONS

392
00:18:26,732 --> 00:18:30,235
WITH THESE BOYS?

393
00:18:30,319 --> 00:18:34,656
AND DID LUKE AND NEIL RECORD
AND DISTRIBUTE THIS ASSAULT?

394
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:36,241
