00:13:51,498 --> 00:13:53,500
I WAS THERE, DUDE!
WHY ARE YOU DEFENDING HIM?

396
00:14:05,721 --> 00:14:07,598

WELL, WE CAN'T FIND HER
ANYWHERE.

531
00:19:29,211 --> 00:19:31,046
WE THOUGHT WE'D SEE HER
WHEN WE WERE GETTING DRESSED,

532
00:19:31,129 --> 00:19:32,714
AND NO ONE'S SEEN HER
SINCE YOU WENT TO TALK TO HER!

538
00:19:43,892 --> 00:19:46,186

00:20:08,292 --> 00:20:10,169
THEN WHERE IS SHE?!

551
00:20:10,252 --> 00:20:12,671
SHE PROBABLY JUST WENT
BACK INSIDE.

552
00:20:12,754 --> 00:20:14,006
WHICH IS WHAT
WE SHOULD BE DOING!

553
00:20:14,089 --> 00:20:15,966

IT'S CLEARING UP!
