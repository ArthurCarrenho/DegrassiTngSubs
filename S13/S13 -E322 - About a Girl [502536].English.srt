YOU DON'T WANNA KISS ME?

SO YOU'RE GOING
TO IMPERSONATE BECKY

350
00:13:28,642 --> 00:13:31,395
AND TELL TODD TO GO SCRAM?

351
00:13:31,478 --> 00:13:33,522
IT'S THE ONLY WAY
I CAN GET RID OF HIM

352
00:13:33,605 --> 00:13:35,315
WITHOUT LETTING HER KNOW
I BROKE INTO HER ACCOUNT.

353
00:13:35,399 --> 00:13:36,775
DOES ANYONE ELSE
THINK THIS IS SKETCHY?

354
00:13:36,859 --> 00:13:37,943
AS LONG AS HE DOES IT
AFTER CAMP HOURS,

355
00:13:38,026 --> 00:13:39,152
I DON'T CARE.

356
00:13:39,236 --> 00:13:40,320
YEAH,
THAT SEEMS SMART.

357
00:13:40,404 --> 00:13:41,613
AS LONG AS IT SOUNDS
LIKE BECKY,

358
00:13:41,697 --> 00:13:43,907
AND YOU DELETE IT
FROM HER OUTBOX RIGHT AFTER.

359
00:13:43,991 --> 00:13:45,492
RIGHT. OKAY.

360
00:13:47,327 --> 00:13:49,913
"DEAR TODD...

361
00:13:49,997 --> 00:13:52,666
THERE'S SOMETHING
I NEED TO TELL YOU."

362
00:13:52,749 --> 00:13:54,334
NO, THAT'S TOO SMART.

BUT I DON'T MENTION HIM MUCH
'CAUSE I KNOW YOU LIKE ME."

370
00:14:11,268 --> 00:14:13,270
BECAUSE YOU WOULD COWER
AT HIS 18 INCH BICEPS.

371
00:14:13,353 --> 00:14:15,314

LOVE IT.

IT'S NOT GONNA WORK.

379
00:14:31,163 --> 00:14:32,706
WHY NOT?
IT SOUNDS LIKE HER.

380
00:14:32,789 --> 00:14:33,999
AND IT'S GONNA
SOUND LIKE HER

381
00:14:34,082 --> 00:14:36,001
WHEN SHE TELLS TODD
SHE DIDN'T SEND IT!

382
00:14:36,752 --> 00:14:38,128
BUT I'M DELETING IT
FROM HER OUTBOX!

383
00:14:38,212 --> 00:14:39,922

TO TELL MILES.

THEN WHY DID YOU?

399
00:15:34,601 --> 00:15:36,770
WELL...

400
00:15:36,854 --> 00:15:38,814

I LIKED HIM.

DO YOU?

402
00:15:40,524 --> 00:15:42,734
OF COURSE NOT!

403
00:15:42,818 --> 00:15:45,445
BUT YOU STILL HAD TO SELL ME OUT
TO PROVE YOUR POINT?

404

ADAM!

519
00:20:04,997 --> 00:20:06,540
IT'S A SIN,

520
00:20:06,623 --> 00:20:08,083
AND I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU
THINK I WOULD!

521
00:20:08,166 --> 00:20:09,251
ADAM:
SO LET'S JUST FORGET
ABOUT IT.

522
00:20:09,334 --> 00:20:11,503
I'M AN IDIOT, OKAY?

523
00:20:11,587 --> 00:20:13,088
LET'S LAUGH IT OFF.
(LAUGHS)

524
00:20:15,883 --> 00:20:17,384
BECKY, PLEASE.

525
00:20:18,635 --> 00:20:20,137
I LOVE YOU.

526
00:20:25,559 --> 00:20:27,978
BECKY:
BUT THERE'S NO LOVE
WITHOUT TRUST, ADAM.

527
00:20:28,061 --> 00:20:29,188
AND IF YOU WON'T TALK TO ME,

528
00:20:29,271 --> 00:20:31,064
THEN YOU OBVIOUSLY
DON'T TRUST ME.

529
00:20:34,276 --> 00:20:36,236
I THINK I NEED SOME TIME
TO THINK ABOUT ALL THIS.

530
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:37,487
ADAM:
NO! BECKY, WAIT!

531
00:20:37,571 --> 00:20:38,488
BECKY:
I'M SORRY.

532
00:20:38,572 --> 00:20:40,073
(PHONE CLICKS OFF)

533
00:20:44,036 --> 00:20:45,537
(SIGHS)
