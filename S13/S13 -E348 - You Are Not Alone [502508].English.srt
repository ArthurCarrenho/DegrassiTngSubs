AND DANCE IN SILENCE.

349
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:48,602
I CALL IT...
SILENT DANCE PARTY.

350
00:12:50,229 --> 00:12:52,022
THAT'S AN APPROPRIATE NAME.

351
00:12:52,105 --> 00:12:53,690
ARE YOU MAKING FUN OF IT?

352
00:12:53,774 --> 00:12:55,692
NO!

353
00:12:55,776 --> 00:12:57,444
NO, NO,
I-I UH...

354
00:12:57,528 --> 00:12:59,154
I LIKE IT.

355
00:12:59,238 --> 00:13:00,739
WE'LL LET YOU KNOW.

356
00:13:03,116 --> 00:13:04,701
THAT'S THE LAST ONE.

357
00:13:04,785 --> 00:13:06,203
READY TO NARROW IT DOWN
TO A SHORT LIST?

358
00:13:06,286 --> 00:13:08,121
CAN I ACTUALLY DO THAT
ON MY OWN?

359
00:13:08,205 --> 00:13:10,332
YOU SURE YOU CAN HANDLE THAT?

360
00:13:10,415 --> 00:13:11,917
OKAY, OKAY.

361
00:13:12,751 --> 00:13:14,253
GOOD LUCK.

362
00:13:19,633 --> 00:13:21,176
MAYA:
GRACE?

363
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:23,637
I NEED YOUR HELP
WITH ZIG.

364
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:25,013
OH GOD, YOU STUCK YOUR NOSE
IN IT AGAIN, DIDN'T YOU?

365
00:13:25,097 --> 00:13:25,889
HE'S DEALING DRUGS AGAIN!

366
00:13:25,973 --> 00:13:27,641
OR... HE WAS.

367
00:13:27,724 --> 00:13:28,725
I FLUSHED THEM.

368
00:13:28,809 --> 00:13:30,018
WOW!

369
00:13:30,102 --> 00:13:31,353
WAS THAT EVER
A BAD IDEA!

370
00:13:31,436 --> 00:13:32,604
I JUST WANTED HIM
TO STOP!

371
00:13:32,688 --> 00:13:33,730
IF HE'S REALLY WORKING
WITH TINY,

372
00:13:33,814 --> 00:13:34,898
WITH THOSE GUYS,

373
00:13:34,982 --> 00:13:37,317
HE CAN'T.
WHY?

374
00:13:37,401 --> 00:13:39,778
FOR STARTERS,
HE OWES THEM MONEY.

375
00:13:39,862 --> 00:13:41,530
HE GETS THE WEED
UP FRONT.

376
00:13:41,613 --> 00:13:42,364
IF HE SELLS,
HE TAKES A SMALL CUT,

377
00:13:42,447 --> 00:13:43,448
AND GIVES THE REST TO TINY.

378
00:13:43,532 --> 00:13:44,950
TINY TAKES A CUT,

379
00:13:45,033 --> 00:13:45,659
AND GIVES THE REST
TO THE GUY ABOVE HIM,

380
00:13:45,742 --> 00:13:47,244
AND SO ON.

381
00:13:47,327 --> 00:13:49,121
SO IT'S LIKE
A PYRAMID SCHEME.

382
00:13:49,204 --> 00:13:50,873
NOT EVERYTHING'S
ABOUT MONEY.

383
00:13:50,956 --> 00:13:52,457
LET ME SHOW YOU.

384
00:13:55,669 --> 00:13:57,838
ALL RIGHT.

385
00:13:57,921 --> 00:13:59,214
ZIG USED TO LIVE...
HERE,

386
00:13:59,298 --> 00:14:00,966
ON TINY'S BLOCK.

387
00:14:01,049 --> 00:14:01,967
HE COULD EITHER
JOIN THESE GUYS

388
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:03,594
OR GET HASSLED
BY THEM.

389
00:14:03,677 --> 00:14:05,679
OKAY, SO BY JOINING,
HE'S SAFE IN HIS NEIGHBOURHOOD?

390
00:14:05,762 --> 00:14:07,306
NOT EVEN.
GANGS ARE SMALL NOW.

391
00:14:07,389 --> 00:14:08,807
TEN TO TWELVE GUYS,
MAYBE.

392
00:14:08,891 --> 00:14:11,143
TERRITORY'S SMALL, TOO.

393
00:14:11,226 --> 00:14:12,895
THERE'S ANOTHER
CLIQUE HERE.

394
00:14:12,978 --> 00:14:14,730
THESE ARE BLOODS.

395
00:14:14,813 --> 00:14:16,315
MS-THIRTEEN IS HERE.

396
00:14:17,316 --> 00:14:18,942
ET CETERA,

397
00:14:19,026 --> 00:14:20,861
ET CETERA.

398
00:14:20,944 --> 00:14:23,572
THE SCHOOL IS HERE.

399
00:14:23,655 --> 00:14:25,199
SO HE NEEDS THE GANG
TO GET TO SCHOOL SAFELY?

400
00:14:25,282 --> 00:14:27,993
BUT HE DOESN'T LIVE
THERE ANYMORE.

401
00:14:28,076 --> 00:14:29,328
HE STILL SEES
SOME OF THOSE GUYS EVERY DAY.

402
00:14:29,411 --> 00:14:30,954
AND NOW,
THANKS TO YOU,

403
00:14:31,038 --> 00:14:34,541
HE OWES THEM
A BUNCH OF MONEY.

404
00:14:34,625 --> 00:14:37,461
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?!

405
00:14:37,544 --> 00:14:39,671

OF STAYING OUT OF IT!

407
00:14:51,308 --> 00:14:52,518

HOME WITH ME,

OR DO TRIATHLETES
RUN EXCLUSIVELY?

409
00:14:55,354 --> 00:14:58,273
I WAS KIDDING,

410
00:14:58,357 --> 00:15:00,901

AT TRIATHLON CLUB.

411
00:15:00,984 --> 00:15:02,402
HOW DO YOU MEAN?
IT TOOK ME TEN MINUTES
TO SIT DOWN.

412
00:15:02,486 --> 00:15:04,321
I DON'T THINK
I'M GETTING BACK UP.

413
00:15:04,404 --> 00:15:07,407
LET ME HELP YOU.
I CAN'T LIFT
MY ARM EITHER!

414
00:15:07,491 --> 00:15:09,618
WHY, WERE YOU RUNNING
ON YOUR HANDS?

415
00:15:09,701 --> 00:15:10,744
I WENT TO AN AXE-THROWING LEAGUE
WITH JACK

416
00:15:10,827 --> 00:15:12,371
FROM TRIATHLON CLUB.

417
00:15:12,454 --> 00:15:14,665
WAIT. JACK,
AS IN IMOGEN'S FRIEND JACK?

418
00:15:14,748 --> 00:15:16,375
IT WAS SO COOL,
OUT IN THE WOODS.

419
00:15:16,458 --> 00:15:18,210
WE HAD BEER
AND TOSSED AXES,

420
00:15:18,293 --> 00:15:19,419
IT WAS JUST A BUNCH
OF LADIES

421
00:15:19,503 --> 00:15:21,171
AND NO ONE MENTIONED GUYS
EVEN ONCE!

422

ALL THOSE GIRLS GAY?

423

ARE THEY? I DON'T KNOW.
SO WHAT?

424
00:15:27,094 --> 00:15:30,472
SO MAYBE YOU'LL FIND YOURSELF
WITH SOME NEW SUITORS!

425
00:15:30,556 --> 00:15:31,765

THEY'D WANNA HANG OUT WITH ME

I'M FUN TO BE AROUND?

LET ME HELP YOU.

428
00:15:36,436 --> 00:15:38,272
AH, NO, NO, NO!

429
