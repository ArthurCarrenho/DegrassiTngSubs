22
00:00:39,513 --> 00:00:41,349
NO CAN DO.

23
00:00:41,432 --> 00:00:43,059
I'M SEEING A MOVIE WITH ALLI,
JENNA, AND CONNOR.

24
00:00:43,142 --> 00:00:44,852

WHOA, WHOA!
THAT'S NOT WHAT HAPPENED!

31
00:00:54,278 --> 00:00:54,945
CLARE'S THE ONE
WHO WASN'T OVER ELI

32
00:00:55,029 --> 00:00:57,239
