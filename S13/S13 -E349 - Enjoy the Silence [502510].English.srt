00:19:12,569 --> 00:19:14,071
LET'S WORK ON BELIEVABILITY.

521
00:19:18,492 --> 00:19:19,284
IT'S IMPORTANT NOT TO TELL
THE GANG OUTRIGHT

522
00:19:19,368 --> 00:19:20,619
THEY WANT TO LEAVE.

523
00:19:20,702 --> 00:19:22,996
THEY NEED TO FADE OUT
GRADUALLY.

524
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:24,373
THE OTHER PIECE OF THE PUZZLE
IS COMMUNITY.

525
00:19:24,456 --> 00:19:25,791
THEY'RE LOSING ONE,

526
00:19:25,874 --> 00:19:26,834
THEY NEED SUPPORT
FROM ELSEWHERE.

527
00:19:26,917 --> 00:19:29,294
ZIG DOESN'T REALLY TALK
TO HIS PARENTS.

528
00:19:29,378 --> 00:19:31,171
WELL, WE'LL TRY TO SET UP
A REUNION.

529
00:19:31,255 --> 00:19:32,506
HOPEFULLY WE CAN GET HIM BACK
INTO THAT HOUSEHOLD.

530
00:19:32,589 --> 00:19:34,258
WHERE WILL HE STAY
UNTIL THEN?

531
00:19:34,341 --> 00:19:35,592
HE CAN STAY WITH US.

532
00:19:35,676 --> 00:19:36,802
MOM, WHAT IF THE GANG
RETALIATES?

533
00:19:36,885 --> 00:19:38,637
THAT'S POSSIBLE.

534
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:41,014
ALTHOUGH WE'LL TRY TO MEDIATE
IF ANY CONFLICT ARISES.

535
00:19:41,098 --> 00:19:42,015
IF YOU'RE UP
FOR KEEPING HIM HERE,

536
00:19:42,099 --> 00:19:43,600
IT COULD REALLY HELP.

537
00:19:46,270 --> 00:19:47,771
YEAH, I KNOW.
WE HAVE TO.

538
00:19:49,106 --> 00:19:50,983
GREAT.

539
00:19:51,066 --> 00:19:51,525
I SHOULD GIVE YOU
ALL MY CONTACT INFO.

540
00:19:51,608 --> 00:19:53,110
OKAY.

541
00:19:59,408 --> 00:20:00,909
(SIGHS HEAVILY)

542
00:20:02,119 --> 00:20:04,162
SO, LISTEN, UM...

543
00:20:04,246 --> 00:20:06,039
THANKS.

544
00:20:06,123 --> 00:20:08,500
FOR EVERYTHING.

545
00:20:08,584 --> 00:20:10,711
EVEN PRETENDING
YOU WERE INTO ME.

546
00:20:10,794 --> 00:20:13,088
ZIG... I DIDN'T-

547
00:20:13,172 --> 00:20:14,798
YOU DID.

548
00:20:14,882 --> 00:20:16,592
IT'S OKAY.

549
00:20:16,675 --> 00:20:17,968
IF YOU KNEW,
WHY DID YOU GO ALONG?

550
00:20:18,051 --> 00:20:20,179
WELL,
I GOT TO KISS YOU.

551
00:20:20,262 --> 00:20:23,182
(BOTH LAUGH)

552
00:20:23,265 --> 00:20:26,351
BUT OBVIOUSLY,
YOU STILL DIG THE RICH GUY...

553
00:20:26,435 --> 00:20:28,937
AND IT'S OKAY.

554
00:20:29,021 --> 00:20:30,522
FRIENDS?

555
00:20:33,358 --> 00:20:36,570
IF YOU PROMISE
TO STAY OUT OF TROUBLE.

556
00:20:36,653 --> 00:20:38,155
I PROMISE TO TRY.

557
00:20:41,992 --> 00:20:43,493
(BOTH LAUGH)
