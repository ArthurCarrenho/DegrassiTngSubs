1
00:00:02,002 --> 00:00:03,212
DETECTIVE:
CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT
THE INCIDENT THAT OCCURRED

2
00:00:03,295 --> 00:00:07,299
AT MILES HOLLINGSWORTH'S PARTY
INVOLVING ZOE RIVAS?

3
00:00:07,382 --> 00:00:10,552
I WASN'T THERE,
BUT I'VE DONE A LOT OF RESEARCH.

4
00:00:10,636 --> 00:00:13,514
I BELIEVE ZOE WAS ASSAULTED
BY TWO BOYS IN THIS VIDEO.

5
00:00:13,597 --> 00:00:14,848
NO ONE KNEW WHO THEY WERE,

6
00:00:14,932 --> 00:00:15,933
BUT THEN SOMEONE SENT ME
SECURITY FOOTAGE

7
00:00:16,016 --> 00:00:17,518
FROM THAT NIGHT.

8
00:00:20,479 --> 00:00:24,650
THIS IS WINSTON CHU
AND THIS IS MILES HOLLINGSWORTH.

9
00:00:24,733 --> 00:00:25,734
DETECTIVE:
ARE THOSE THE BOYS
WHO ASSAULTED YOU?

10
00:00:25,817 --> 00:00:27,319
I DON'T KNOW.

11
00:00:28,695 --> 00:00:30,322
DETECTIVE:
BUT YOU KNOW THESE BOYS?

12
00:00:30,405 --> 00:00:31,907
YEAH.

13
00:00:33,325 --> 00:00:34,910
I TRIED TO KISS MILES
AT THE PARTY...

14
00:00:34,993 --> 00:00:36,620
I THINK.

15
00:00:36,703 --> 00:00:37,496
DETECTIVE:
YOU THINK?

16
00:00:37,579 --> 00:00:39,998
LOOK, I BLACKED OUT.

17
00:00:40,082 --> 00:00:41,583
I REMEMBER BEING ALONE
WITH TWO GUYS,

18
00:00:41,667 --> 00:00:46,380
BUT I HAVE NO IDEA
WHO THEY WERE

19
00:00:46,463 --> 00:00:48,549
OR WHAT HAPPENED.

20
00:00:48,632 --> 00:00:50,342
DETECTIVE:
IS THIS YOU IN THE VIDEO?

21
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:55,597
NO, I...
NO, I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING WRONG.

22
00:00:57,224 --> 00:00:58,851
CAN I GO TO BASKETBALL PRACTICE?

23
00:00:58,934 --> 00:01:00,018
THIS IS THE LAST ONE
BEFORE THE PLAYOFFS.

24
00:01:00,102 --> 00:01:01,812
DETECTIVE:
ANSWER THE QUESTION.

25
00:01:01,895 --> 00:01:03,480
WINSTON:
YES, IT'S US
IN THE SECURITY FOOTAGE.

26
00:01:03,564 --> 00:01:05,732
WE CARRIED ZOE OFF
TO THE POOL HOUSE

27
00:01:05,816 --> 00:01:07,359
SO SHE COULD SLEEP IT OFF.

28
00:01:07,442 --> 00:01:09,903
BUT IT'S NOT US
IN THE ASSAULT VIDEO.

29
00:01:09,987 --> 00:01:10,404
DETECTIVE:
I'VE SEEN SOME
PRETTY CONVINCING EVIDENCE.

30
00:01:10,487 --> 00:01:11,989
IT'S WRONG!

31
00:01:13,282 --> 00:01:15,492
I'M SORRY, DETECTIVE,
BUT... I CAN PROVE IT!

32
00:01:19,288 --> 00:01:20,831
THERE'S A TIME CODE EMBEDDED
IN THE ASSAULT VIDEO -

33
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:23,917
10:15 P.M.

34
00:01:24,001 --> 00:01:26,128
10:10 P.M., 10:16 P.M.,
ALL ACCOUNTED FOR.

35
00:01:28,422 --> 00:01:31,049
FALSE ACCUSATIONS
ARE VERY SERIOUS.

36
00:01:31,133 --> 00:01:33,969
I'M SO, SO SORRY.
I HONESTLY THOUGHT IT WAS THEM.

37
00:01:34,052 --> 00:01:34,386
DETECTIVE:
WELL, WE'RE GOING TO HAVE
TO KEEP THESE.

38
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:36,180
OF COURSE.

39
00:01:36,263 --> 00:01:37,764
(STEADYING BREATHS)

40
00:01:42,394 --> 00:01:43,562
BUT IF IT WASN'T THEM,
WHO WAS IT?

41
00:01:43,645 --> 00:01:45,647
♪♪♪

42
00:01:45,731 --> 00:01:47,941
♪ Whatever it takes ♪

43
00:01:48,025 --> 00:01:49,860
♪ (The best that I can be) ♪

44
00:01:49,943 --> 00:01:51,236
♪ Ooh, ooh, ooh ♪

45
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:53,447
♪ I know I can make it through ♪

46
00:01:58,952 --> 00:02:00,454
BECKY:
THIS IS CRAZY!

47
00:02:00,537 --> 00:02:02,372
ARE THEY INTERVIEWING
EVERY GUY IN SCHOOL?

48
00:02:02,456 --> 00:02:03,373
YEAH, EVERYONE
WHO WAS AT THE PARTY

49
00:02:03,457 --> 00:02:04,416
AND EVERYONE
WHO TWEETED PICTURES.

50
00:02:04,499 --> 00:02:05,459
THE WHOLE
BASKETBALL TEAM?

51
00:02:05,542 --> 00:02:07,044
YEAH. ONE BY ONE.

52
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:11,548
(CRIES)
THIS IS ALL MY FAULT.

53
00:02:11,632 --> 00:02:14,510
I NEVER SHOULD HAVE
GOTTEN INVOLVED.

54
00:02:14,593 --> 00:02:16,428
I'M GONNA TAKE
MY EVIDENCE DOWN RIGHT NOW,

55
00:02:16,512 --> 00:02:17,554
IF I'M EVEN WELCOME
IN THE STUDENT COUNCIL ROOM.

56
00:02:17,638 --> 00:02:19,848
HEY, HEY.

57
00:02:19,932 --> 00:02:20,933
IF ANYONE GIVES YOU
ANY PROBLEMS,

58
00:02:21,016 --> 00:02:23,685
YOU JUST TELL 'EM
TO TALK TO YOUR BRO.

59
00:02:23,769 --> 00:02:25,270
(HALF LAUGHS)
ALL RIGHT?

60
00:02:27,272 --> 00:02:27,648
IT'LL BE ALL RIGHT.
OKAY.

61
00:02:27,731 --> 00:02:29,233
OKAY.

62
00:02:33,237 --> 00:02:34,488
NO, YOU HAVE NO IDEA

63
00:02:34,571 --> 00:02:36,031
WHAT IT'S LIKE FOR HER
RIGHT NOW.

64
00:02:36,114 --> 00:02:38,408
STUDENT COUNCIL CAN'T POSSIBLY
STILL THROW A PEP RALLY!

65
00:02:38,492 --> 00:02:39,660
DALLAS:
BUT THIS IS DEGRASSI'S
FIRST PLAYOFF BASKETBALL GAME

66
00:02:39,743 --> 00:02:41,828
IN TWO SEASONS.

67
00:02:41,912 --> 00:02:43,664
DREW:
YEAH. THE SCHOOL
SHOULD SUPPORT THE TEAM.

68
00:02:43,747 --> 00:02:45,207
CLARE:
TWO OF WHOM
ARE SEXUAL PREDATORS.

69
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:46,500
DALLAS:
MILES WAS CLEARED.

70
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:47,960
THERE'S NO PROOF
THAT MY BOYS DID THIS.

71
00:02:48,043 --> 00:02:49,378
CLARE:
THERE'S NO PROOF THEY DIDN'T.

72
00:02:49,461 --> 00:02:50,420
DREW:
BUT THE POLICE HAVEN'T
PRESSED CHARGES.

73
00:02:50,504 --> 00:02:51,338
THE WHOLE SCHOOL
SHOULDN'T BE PUNISHED

74
00:02:51,421 --> 00:02:53,131
BECAUSE OF TWO IDIOTS.

75
00:02:53,215 --> 00:02:54,842
IT WASN'T JUST TWO GUYS,
DREW!

76
00:02:54,925 --> 00:02:55,884
EVERYONE AT THAT THIS PARTY
LET THIS HAPPEN.

77
00:02:55,968 --> 00:02:57,469
YOU LET THIS HAPPEN.

78
00:03:00,681 --> 00:03:01,640
IT'S JUST NOT THE RIGHT TIME
FOR A PEP RALLY.

79
00:03:01,723 --> 00:03:03,225
WE SHOULDN'T EVEN
HAVE THE GAME.

80
00:03:05,102 --> 00:03:06,603
(SCHOOL BELL RINGS)

81
00:03:18,282 --> 00:03:19,783
SORRY.

82
00:03:21,618 --> 00:03:24,037
(SCOFFED LAUGHTER)
YOU DIDN'T MAKE THE VIDEO.

83
00:03:24,454 --> 00:03:26,957
I GOT THE POLICE
INVOLVED.

84
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,542
I BROKE HER HEART.

85
00:03:30,627 --> 00:03:32,045
ZOE WAS DRUNK AT THAT PARTY
'CAUSE OF ME.

86
00:03:32,129 --> 00:03:34,673
(EXHALES, STRESSED)

87
00:03:34,756 --> 00:03:36,675
BECKY:
OKAY, SO HOW DO WE FIX THIS?

88
00:03:38,468 --> 00:03:39,678
TILL EVERYONE FINDS OUT

89
00:03:39,761 --> 00:03:40,846
WHO WAS ACTUALLY
IN THAT VIDEO,

90
00:03:40,929 --> 00:03:42,431
WE CAN'T.

91
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:50,772
MILES PLUS WINSTON
EQUALS...

92
00:03:50,856 --> 00:03:52,357
NOT PERVS!
NOT PERVS.            HA-HA!

93
00:04:00,032 --> 00:04:02,326
NOW I'M FREE TO FOCUS
ON THE BIG GAME.

94
00:04:02,409 --> 00:04:03,952
YOU WANT FRONT ROW SEATS
SO YOU CAN CHEER ME ON?

95
00:04:04,036 --> 00:04:05,454
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

96
00:04:05,537 --> 00:04:06,830
WHAT? WE'RE CLEARED,
SERIOUSLY.

97
00:04:06,914 --> 00:04:09,082
CHEWY.

98
00:04:09,166 --> 00:04:11,335
IN OFFICIAL
POLICE PARLANCE,

99
00:04:11,418 --> 00:04:12,920
WE'RE "NO LONGER
PERSONS OF INTEREST."

100
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:16,173
I THOUGHT
YOU'D BE HAPPY.
MILES,

101
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:17,674
THEY CANCELLED
THE PEP RALLY.

102
00:04:17,758 --> 00:04:19,635
WHAT? WHY?
BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY
THEY THINK

103
00:04:19,718 --> 00:04:21,220
THE GUYS WERE ON
THE BASKETBALL TEAM.

104
00:04:21,303 --> 00:04:23,597
WELL,
THEY COULDN'T HAVE BEEN.

105
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:24,681
BUT IT IS YOU
IN THOSE PARTY PHOTOS,

106
00:04:24,765 --> 00:04:26,433
ISN'T IT,

107
00:04:26,517 --> 00:04:28,727
CARRYING ZOE, HALF-NAKED,
THROUGH THE PARTY?

108
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:29,561
LOOK,
I ALREADY TOLD YOU-

109
00:04:29,645 --> 00:04:31,271
YOU DIDN'T GROPE HER.

110
00:04:33,649 --> 00:04:36,652
BUT WHAT ELSE HAPPENED?
WHY WERE YOU WITH HER?

111
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:40,322
(SIGHS)

112
00:04:44,076 --> 00:04:45,577
I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING WRONG!

113
00:04:47,538 --> 00:04:49,915
TWO GUYS MADE THE VIDEO.
IT COULD'VE BEEN ANY TWO!

114
00:04:49,998 --> 00:04:50,916
DREW:
SO WHAT, WE NEED TO FIND
EVERY PICTURE

115
00:04:50,999 --> 00:04:53,502
WITH, WHAT, TWO GUYS IN IT?!

116
00:04:53,585 --> 00:04:56,713
BECKY: BINGO!
IMOGEN: GUYS!

117
00:04:56,797 --> 00:04:59,216
IMOGEN:
DON'T YOU THINK THE POLICE HAVE
ALREADY THOUGHT ABOUT OF THIS?

118
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:01,969
BECKY:
WELL, ISN'T IT OUR DUTY TO HELP
AS CONCERNED CITIZENS?

119
00:05:02,052 --> 00:05:04,054
WHY DO YOU EVEN CARE?
YOU BARELY KNOW ZOE.

120
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:05,681
BECKY:
WELL, WHAT IF IT HAD BEEN ME?

121
00:05:05,764 --> 00:05:07,307
IMOGEN:
YOU DON'T DRINK.

122
00:05:07,391 --> 00:05:09,017
BECKY:
WHAT IF I TRIED?
I DON'T KNOW HOW TO DRINK.

123
00:05:09,101 --> 00:05:09,768
WHAT IF I HAD PASSED OUT
AT THAT PARTY?

124
00:05:09,852 --> 00:05:11,353
WHAT IF YOU DID?

125
00:05:12,855 --> 00:05:16,650
LOOK, GUYS,
EVERYONE IS BEING BLAMED.

126
00:05:16,733 --> 00:05:17,609
ALL RIGHT,
THAT ANONYMOUS JERK,

127
00:05:17,693 --> 00:05:18,485
THE WATCHER,
HAS BEEN POSTING PHOTOS

128
00:05:18,569 --> 00:05:20,445
OF EVERY GUY IN THE SCHOOL

129
00:05:20,529 --> 00:05:22,990
WITH THE LABEL "RAPIST"
ON IT, ALL RIGHT?

130
00:05:23,073 --> 00:05:24,575
INCLUDING ME!

131
00:05:25,909 --> 00:05:27,327
AND THOSE GUYS,

132
00:05:27,411 --> 00:05:29,121
THE REAL GUYS
WHO DID THIS TO ZOE,

133
00:05:29,204 --> 00:05:31,039
THEY'RE STILL OUT THERE.

134
00:05:34,877 --> 00:05:36,378
OKAY.

135
00:05:38,297 --> 00:05:39,756
SO WE'RE LOOKING
AT ALL THE PICTURES

136
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,341
WITH TWO GUYS TOGETHER.

137
00:05:45,179 --> 00:05:46,680
OKAY.

138
00:05:49,224 --> 00:05:51,435
DOCTOR:
ZOE...

139
00:05:51,518 --> 00:05:55,981
THIS IS A DELICATE SITUATION,
BUT I HAVE YOUR RESULTS.

140
00:05:56,064 --> 00:05:57,441
WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO CALL
YOUR MOTHER IN?

141
00:05:57,524 --> 00:05:58,901
UNLESS I'M DYING,

142
00:05:58,984 --> 00:06:00,110
SHE CAN STAY
IN THE WAITING ROOM.

143
00:06:00,194 --> 00:06:01,695
DOCTOR:
ARE YOU SURE?

144
00:06:04,281 --> 00:06:07,743
OKAY. WELL, THERE'S NO EVIDENCE
OF PREGNANCY YET.

145
00:06:07,826 --> 00:06:10,829
WE'VE TESTED FOR
THE STANDARD STIS AND HIV.

146
00:06:10,913 --> 00:06:13,790
BUT EVEN IF THE RESULTS
ARE NEGATIVE NOW,

147
00:06:13,874 --> 00:06:16,502
WE'LL HAVE TO RETEST
IN A FEW MONTHS.

148
00:06:16,585 --> 00:06:18,086
IS THAT REALLY NECESSARY?

149
00:06:20,214 --> 00:06:22,841
DOCTOR:
YOUR EXAM SHOWED SIGNS
OF TRAUMA TO THE VAGINAL AREA.

150
00:06:25,719 --> 00:06:27,596
I WAS RAPED?

151
00:06:27,679 --> 00:06:29,640
DOCTOR:
LIKELY NOT INTERCOURSE...

152
00:06:29,723 --> 00:06:31,892
BUT THERE WAS INSERTION.

153
00:06:31,975 --> 00:06:33,560
IF YOU'D COME IN SOONER,

154
00:06:33,644 --> 00:06:35,312
WE COULD HAVE HAD
A CLEARER PICTURE.

155
00:06:46,949 --> 00:06:48,659
HEY, CUTIE!
WHERE ARE WE EATING LUNCH?

156
00:06:51,328 --> 00:06:52,287
FRANKIE:
I WAS HEADED TO THE CAF,

157
00:06:52,371 --> 00:06:54,039
BUT, UM,
MAYBE WE CAN EAT OUTSIDE.

158
00:06:54,998 --> 00:06:56,500
WHY?

159
00:07:00,462 --> 00:07:02,214
PEOPLE ARE MAD AT YOU.

160
00:07:02,297 --> 00:07:04,633
AT ME?

161
00:07:04,716 --> 00:07:06,176
THE PEP RALLY GOT CANCELLED
'CAUSE OF THE ACCUSATIONS.

162
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:07,719
WHICH I DIDN'T MAKE.

163
00:07:07,803 --> 00:07:09,596
BUT EVERYONE THINKS
YOU DID.

164
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:12,933
THEY SAY...

165
00:07:13,016 --> 00:07:14,518
WHAT?

166
00:07:16,061 --> 00:07:16,895
THEY SAY YOU HAD SEX
WITH THOSE GUYS

167
00:07:16,979 --> 00:07:18,480
AND REGRETTED IT,

168
00:07:21,275 --> 00:07:22,776
SO YOU CRIED RAPE.

169
00:07:25,237 --> 00:07:26,613
YOU DON'T BELIEVE THAT,
DO YOU?

170
00:07:26,697 --> 00:07:28,073
THAT IS SORTA WHAT HAPPENED
WITH DREW,

171
00:07:28,156 --> 00:07:29,074
AND YOU WERE WALKING
AROUND THAT PARTY

172
00:07:29,157 --> 00:07:30,492
SAYING YOU WANTED
TO MAKE OUT WITH GUYS.

173
00:07:30,576 --> 00:07:32,452
SO WHAT,
I WAS ASKING FOR IT?!

174
00:07:36,206 --> 00:07:39,001
YOU TOO, HUH?

175
00:07:39,084 --> 00:07:42,713
GO AHEAD,
EAT LUNCH WITHOUT ME.

176
00:07:42,796 --> 00:07:44,423
I'LL BE FINE
ON MY OWN.

177
00:07:55,309 --> 00:07:55,851
BECKY:
THESE ARE THE PAIRS OF GUYS
WHO WERE SEEN TOGETHER

178
00:07:55,934 --> 00:07:57,436
AT THE PARTY.

179
00:07:58,020 --> 00:07:59,521
NOW WHAT DO WE DO?

180
00:08:01,356 --> 00:08:02,858
BECKY: I DON'T KNOW.
GRACE: I DO.

181
00:08:05,611 --> 00:08:06,320
DON'T WORRY,
I ALREADY KNOW ABOUT

182
00:08:06,403 --> 00:08:08,488
YOUR LITTLE ROGUES' GALLERY.

183
00:08:08,572 --> 00:08:10,073
UM, WHO ARE YOU?

184
00:08:11,909 --> 00:08:15,245
DEFENDER OF JUSTICE,
FRIEND TO THE LITTLE GUY.

185
00:08:15,329 --> 00:08:18,290
IMOGEN:
WAIT, THAT'S THE WATCHER'S
TWITTER BIO.

186
00:08:18,373 --> 00:08:20,292
YOU'RE THE WATCHER?!

187
00:08:20,375 --> 00:08:21,877
DREW:
YOU'RE A JERK.

188
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,504
YOU'RE THE REASON
I MADE A FALSE ACCUSATION

189
00:08:23,587 --> 00:08:24,463
TO THE POLICE.
I KNOW,
AND I WANNA FIX THAT.

190
00:08:24,546 --> 00:08:26,673
WHY SHOULD WE TRUST YOU?

191
00:08:26,757 --> 00:08:27,883
GRACE:
I'M LETTING YOU KNOW
MY REAL IDENTITY.

192
00:08:27,966 --> 00:08:29,468
DEFEATS THE PURPOSE
OF BEING ANONYMOUS.

193
00:08:29,551 --> 00:08:31,053
OKAY, WHAT DO WE DO?

194
00:08:35,682 --> 00:08:36,975
GRACE:
SEND AN ANONYMOUS EMAIL
TO ONE GUY FROM EACH PAIR.

195
00:08:37,059 --> 00:08:38,393
SAY SOMETHING LIKE,

196
00:08:38,477 --> 00:08:40,354
"I KNOW IT WAS YOU
WHO ASSAULTED ZOE.

197
00:08:40,437 --> 00:08:42,231
YOUR BUDDY ALREADY
RATTED YOU OUT."

198
00:08:42,314 --> 00:08:43,148
THEN WE WAIT
AND WATCH.

199
00:08:43,232 --> 00:08:45,692
WAIT FOR WHAT?

200
00:08:45,776 --> 00:08:47,194
ONE OF THOSE DUDES
TO CONFRONT HIS BUDDY.

201
00:08:47,277 --> 00:08:48,946
NOBODY LIKES A SNITCH.

202
00:08:49,029 --> 00:08:51,240
QUICK LEARNER.
GOLD STAR FOR YOU.

203
00:08:51,323 --> 00:08:53,283
THIS'LL REALLY WORK?

204
00:08:53,367 --> 00:08:54,493
GRACE:
IF NOT, I'VE GOT SOME
OTHER TRICKS UP MY SLEEVE.

205
00:08:54,576 --> 00:08:56,078
(SCHOOL BELL RINGS)

206
00:08:58,205 --> 00:08:59,540
DALLAS: (PA ANNOUNCEMENT)
DUE TO UNFORESEEN CIRCUMSTANCES

207
00:08:59,623 --> 00:09:00,624
THE PLAYOFF PEP RALLY
HAS BEEN CANCELLED,

208
00:09:00,707 --> 00:09:02,459
HOWEVER,
THE GAME GOES ON.

209
00:09:02,543 --> 00:09:03,043
COME OUT
AND CHEER ON OUR BOYS.

210
00:09:03,126 --> 00:09:04,628
GO PANTHERS!

211
00:09:08,423 --> 00:09:09,258
I PAID YOUR PARTNER
TO SWITCH WITH ME.

212
00:09:09,341 --> 00:09:12,469
YOU'RE MINE FOR THE HOUR.

213
00:09:12,553 --> 00:09:14,805
I JUST WANNA WORK
ON MY ASSIGNMENT.

214
00:09:14,888 --> 00:09:16,849
OKAY, LOOK,
I KNOW LIFE SUCKS FOR YOU,

215
00:09:16,932 --> 00:09:18,058
BUT I NEED YOU
TO TELL MAYA

216
00:09:18,141 --> 00:09:19,560
THAT NOTHING HAPPENED
BETWEEN US.

217
00:09:19,643 --> 00:09:21,687
SO YOU WANT ME
TO SEND HER A MEMO?

218
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:24,815
YEAH,
OR JUST TALK TO HER.

219
00:09:24,898 --> 00:09:26,650
I NEED THINGS
TO GO BACK TO NORMAL.

220
00:09:29,111 --> 00:09:30,654
DO YOU KNOW
WHAT IT'S LIKE

221
00:09:30,737 --> 00:09:33,699
NOT KNOWING
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU?

222
00:09:33,782 --> 00:09:37,202
NOT KNOWING
IF SOMEONE TOUCHED YOU?

223
00:09:37,286 --> 00:09:38,787
YEAH, I CAN'T IMAGINE,
BUT THAT'S NOT MY FAULT.

224
00:09:38,871 --> 00:09:41,915
YOU KNOW WHAT?
KIND OF IS.

225
00:09:41,999 --> 00:09:43,792
(SCOFFS)
I DID NOTHING.
EXACTLY!

226
00:09:43,876 --> 00:09:46,336
YOU SAW HOW DRUNK I WAS
AND YOU DID NOTHING.

227
00:09:48,297 --> 00:09:49,798
LEFT ME SOMEWHERE.

228
00:09:50,883 --> 00:09:52,342
WHAT WAS I SUPPOSED TO DO?

229
00:09:52,426 --> 00:09:55,971
SOMETHING, ANYTHING!
MADE SURE I WAS SAFE.

230
00:09:56,054 --> 00:09:57,723
YOU LET THEM
DO THIS TO ME!

231
00:10:14,031 --> 00:10:15,991
IMOGEN:
SEE ANYTHING WEIRD?

232
00:10:16,074 --> 00:10:19,203
BECKY:
YEAH, THESE TWO,
BUT SO FAR NO REACTION.

233
00:10:19,286 --> 00:10:20,287
IMOGEN:
WELL, MY GUYS LOOKED
REALLY CONFUSED,

234
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:22,456
SO IT OBVIOUSLY WASN'T THEM.

235
00:10:22,539 --> 00:10:23,540
BECKY:
DON'T WORRY. I'M PRETTY SURE
IT'S THESE TWO DIRTBAGS.

236
00:10:23,624 --> 00:10:24,833
NEIL:
WHAT THE HELL, BRO?!

237
00:10:24,917 --> 00:10:25,876
YOU SAID
WE WERE GONNA KEEP QUIET!

238
00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:28,003
LUKE:
'KAY, DUDE, CHILL OUT!

239
00:10:28,086 --> 00:10:28,837
LOOK, I DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING
TO ANYBODY.

240
00:10:28,921 --> 00:10:30,631
WHAT HAPPENED?

241
00:10:30,714 --> 00:10:32,508
NEIL:
SOMEONE EMAILED ME
THIS MORNING

242
00:10:32,591 --> 00:10:34,635
AND THEY'RE SAYING
THAT YOU TOLD THEM.

243
00:10:34,718 --> 00:10:37,095
LUKE: TOLD 'EM WHAT?
NEIL: TOLD THEM WHAT WE DID.

244
00:10:37,721 --> 00:10:39,223
OH MY GOSH.
BECKY...

245
00:10:40,224 --> 00:10:42,142
NO. NO.

246
00:10:42,226 --> 00:10:44,269
LUKE, LUKE COULDN'T HAVE
BEEN INVOLVED.

247
00:10:44,353 --> 00:10:45,896
THOSE ARE THE ONLY TWO
THAT REACTED.

248
00:10:45,979 --> 00:10:47,606
YEAH,
BUT HE'S MY BROTHER.

249
00:10:47,689 --> 00:10:48,315
HE ALREADY TALKED
TO THE POLICE.

250
00:10:48,398 --> 00:10:49,608
HE'S BEEN CLEARED.

251
00:10:49,691 --> 00:10:51,777
SO HAS EVERYONE,
BASICALLY.

252
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:53,362
IT DIDN'T SOUND LIKE HIM
IN THE VIDEO.

253
00:10:53,445 --> 00:10:55,322
IT DIDN'T SOUND LIKE ANYONE,
IT SOUNDED LIKE A ROBOT.

254
00:10:55,405 --> 00:10:56,657
OKAY, THEN MAYBE
IT WAS A ROBOT.

255
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:58,825
EVERYONE'S SCARED,
BECKS,

256
00:10:58,909 --> 00:11:01,537
AND THAT GRACE GIRL
IS GONNA FIND OUT ANYWAY.

257
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:03,288
JUST LET ME
TALK TO HIM, OKAY?

258
00:11:08,126 --> 00:11:09,795
LUKE:
LOOK, DUDE,
I DIDN'T TELL A SINGLE PERSON.

259
00:11:09,878 --> 00:11:12,089
HONESTLY, JUST CHILL OUT.

260
00:11:12,172 --> 00:11:14,132
WE'RE FINE.
NOBODY HERE KNOWS.

261
00:11:14,216 --> 00:11:14,633
JUST... I'LL TALK TO YOU
AFTER SCHOOL, ALL RIGHT?

262
00:11:14,716 --> 00:11:16,218
JUST SHUT UP.

263
00:11:34,069 --> 00:11:36,363
AH! YOU CREEPER,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

264
00:11:36,446 --> 00:11:39,116
UM, I FORGOT
MY SCIENCE PROJECT.

265
00:11:39,199 --> 00:11:40,158
UM, CAN I BORROW YOUR PHONE
TO CALL MOM

266
00:11:40,242 --> 00:11:41,869
TO COME BRING IT?

267
00:11:41,952 --> 00:11:42,411
WHAT HAPPENED
TO YOUR PHONE?

268
00:11:42,494 --> 00:11:44,788
I FORGOT IT TOO!

269
00:11:44,872 --> 00:11:46,790

278
00:13:05,661 --> 00:13:07,955
TELL ME
THIS ISN'T YOU.

279
00:13:08,038 --> 00:13:10,290
BECKY-
TELL ME WHAT I'M SEEING
ISN'T REAL.

280
00:13:10,374 --> 00:13:11,959
OKAY, LOOK,
IT'S NOT LIKE IT SEEMS.

281
00:13:12,042 --> 00:13:13,502
SHE KISSED US.
SHE WAS INTO IT.

282
00:13:13,585 --> 00:13:15,212
SHE WAS TOO DRUNK!

283
00:13:15,295 --> 00:13:16,839
SHE KEPT ON ASKING US
IF WE THOUGHT SHE WAS SEXY.

284
00:13:16,922 --> 00:13:18,674
SHE WANTED TO FOOL AROUND
WITH US.

285
00:13:18,757 --> 00:13:21,009
LUKE...

286
00:13:21,093 --> 00:13:22,302
LOOK, BECKY,
I WOULD NEVER HURT ANYONE.

00:13:24,763 --> 00:13:26,557
JUST GIVE ME BACK MY PHONE.
CLASS IS GONNA START SOON.

289
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:28,141
I CAN'T.

290
00:13:31,395 --> 00:13:35,107
WHAT, YOU'D SHOW THE VIDEO
TO THE POLICE?

291
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:37,109
I'M YOUR BROTHER.
WHOSE SIDE ARE YOU ON?

292
00:13:41,154 --> 00:13:42,781

I DON'T REMEMBER IT.

305
00:14:34,708 --> 00:14:36,210
SO CAN'T WE JUST FORGET IT?

306
00:14:41,882 --> 00:14:44,259

WE JUST PUT IT BEHIND US,

BELIEVE YOU ANYWAYS.

00:14:49,431 --> 00:14:51,350
I'M A GOOD CHRISTIAN GUY,
I'M A HOCKEY STAR,

00:14:51,433 --> 00:14:53,101
I'M ON THE BASKETBALL TEAM.

312
00:14:57,356 --> 00:14:58,482
LOOK, YOU'RE GONNA RUIN MY LIFE
IF YOU KEEP THIS UP.

313
00:14:58,565 --> 00:15:00,651
MINE'S ALREADY RUINED!

314
00:15:00,734 --> 00:15:01,985
YEAH, BUT THAT'S BECAUSE PEOPLE
THINK THAT SOMETHING HAPPENED.

315
00:15:02,069 --> 00:15:04,154
I WILL TELL THEM
THAT IT DIDN'T.

316
00:15:04,238 --> 00:15:04,738
I WILL TELL PEOPLE
THAT IT DIDN'T GO ANY FURTHER

317
00:15:04,821 --> 00:15:07,824

318
00:15:07,908 --> 00:15:10,077
LOOK, PEOPLE WILL FINALLY
SHUT UP ABOUT THIS THING,

319
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,578

00:15:57,583 --> 00:15:58,292
THE GUY IN THE VIDEO
