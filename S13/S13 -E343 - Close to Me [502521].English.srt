SOME TIME TOGETHER,

91

SORT THINGS OUT WITH IMOGEN?

I ACCIDENTALLY ASKED HER
TO BE MY DATE TO THE DANCE.

122
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:25,742
HOW DO YOU ACCIDENTALLY
ASK SOMEONE OUT?!

123

ACTUALLY.

BECKY:
I DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHAT WENT WRONG!

125
00:05:28,829 --> 00:05:30,455
ALL I SAID WAS THAT
I WANTED A NIGHT

126
00:05:30,539 --> 00:05:31,331
TO GET TO KNOW EACH OTHER
MORE INTIMATELY.

127
00:05:31,415 --> 00:05:32,833

INTIMATELY?

128
00:05:32,916 --> 00:05:33,876
THAT MIGHT BE
WHERE THINGS WENT WRONG.

129
00:05:33,959 --> 00:05:35,586
OH.

130
00:05:35,669 --> 00:05:37,713
WELL, YOU COULD BECOME

I'M PRETTY SURE
THAT'S NOT HOW IT WORKS.

00:05:39,631 --> 00:05:42,050
OR YOU COULD PRETEND
TO BE A LESBIAN, YOU KNOW?

133
00:05:42,134 --> 00:05:43,969
KISSING GIRLS ISN'T
ALL THAT BAD.

MAYBE IF WE TAKE IT
SUPER SLOW,

135
00:05:45,387 --> 00:05:47,306

HE JUST DOESN'T KNOW YOU.

142

WHY NOT?

146
00:06:11,121 --> 00:06:11,914

BUT THIS ONE WILL GET UNDER
MONEYBAG'S SKIN.

151
00:06:17,503 --> 00:06:19,004
BY BEING
A LITTLE TOO LIPPY.

152
00:06:19,087 --> 00:06:20,047
AND THEN I'LL HAVE TO PUT MILES
IN A CHOKE HOLD

153
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:21,924
TO KEEP HIM FROM KILLING
OUR DARLING ZIG.

154

AND I'LL ACCIDENTALLY
SET THE GYM ON FIRE.

AND THEN IT'S OFF TO JUVIE
FOR ALL OF US.

A LITTLE PESSIMISTIC ABOUT THIS.

COME ON, ZIG,
I'VE SEEN YOU BUST A MOVE.

159

IT'S NOT MY JOB TO FIX
YOUR RELATIONSHIP, MAYA.

160
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:37,856
BUT-

161
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:39,608
LEARN TO TAKE "NO"
FOR AN ANSWER!

162
00:06:43,028 --> 00:06:43,987
ADORABLE! PERFECT!
LET'S GO!

163
00:06:44,071 --> 00:06:45,447
IT'S NOT TOO POUFY?

164
00:06:45,531 --> 00:06:47,282
ALLI:
NO, IT'S GREAT!

165
00:06:47,366 --> 00:06:48,992

00:06:49,993 --> 00:06:51,411
CONNOR WOULD LOVE YOU

168
00:06:51,495 --> 00:06:53,413
EVEN IF YOU LOOKED LIKE
A GIANT CUPCAKE.

169
00:06:54,248 --> 00:06:55,541
YOU THINK I LOOK LIKE
A GIANT CUPCAKE!

170
00:06:55,624 --> 00:06:57,543
SO NOT WHAT I MEANT!

171
00:06:57,626 --> 00:06:58,919
NOPE, I'M NOT WEARING
THIS TONIGHT!

172
00:06:59,002 --> 00:07:00,295
OKAY,
BUT WE'RE ALREADY LATE

TO LOSE A FRIEND.

348
00:15:30,681 --> 00:15:32,391
SO YOU THINK
SHE'D SAY YES?

349
00:15:32,474 --> 00:15:33,934
(LAUGHS)

350
00:15:34,017 --> 00:15:34,977
I HAVE A HUNCH.

351
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:36,562
(BOTH LAUGH)

352
00:15:38,856 --> 00:15:40,774
I WISH I HAD A FRIEND
LIKE YOU.

353
00:15:42,568 --> 00:15:44,486
WELL, PLAY YOUR CARDS RIGHT
AND MAYBE YOU WILL.

354
00:15:44,570 --> 00:15:46,154
(LAUGHS) THANKS.

355
00:15:47,614 --> 00:15:49,116
YEAH.

356
00:15:50,993 --> 00:15:52,494
♪ The only party hero ♪

357
00:15:54,246 --> 00:15:56,665
SO THOSE ARE ACTUAL HOLES
IN YOUR FACE.

358
00:15:56,748 --> 00:15:58,083
YES.

359
00:15:58,166 --> 00:15:59,668
AH.

360
00:16:00,794 --> 00:16:03,130
CAN I TOUCH THEM?

361
00:16:03,213 --> 00:16:04,590
NO! OKAY.

362
00:16:04,673 --> 00:16:06,175
NO...

363
00:16:07,467 --> 00:16:09,845
HAVE YOU GUYS SEEN MILES?

364
00:16:09,928 --> 00:16:11,847
ZIG, I NEED YOU
TO COME WITH ME.

365
00:16:13,307 --> 00:16:15,893
MAYA:
WHAT'S GOING ON?

366
00:16:15,976 --> 00:16:18,020
I'VE GOTTEN REPORTS
THERE'S DRUGS IN YOUR LOCKER.

367
00:16:18,103 --> 00:16:19,897
I NEED YOU TO OPEN IT
SO I CAN DO AN INSPECTION.

368
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:21,815
THIS IS RIDICULOUS!

369
00:16:21,899 --> 00:16:23,400
ZIG:
YEAH, WHAT GIVES YOU THE RIGHT
TO SEARCH MY LOCKER?!

370
00:16:23,483 --> 00:16:24,985
THE SCHOOL CHARTER!

371
00:16:26,195 --> 00:16:27,696
COME ON.

372
00:16:32,743 --> 00:16:34,036
WHAT'S GOING ON?

373
00:16:34,119 --> 00:16:37,497
YOU RAT!
I KNOW IT WAS YOU!

374
00:16:37,581 --> 00:16:39,124
MAYA:
NO, MILES WOULD NEVER DO
ANYTHING LIKE THAT!

375
00:16:39,208 --> 00:16:40,709
RIGHT?
RIGHT.

376
00:16:42,836 --> 00:16:44,296
HE CAN'T EVEN
LOOK AT YOU!

377
00:16:44,379 --> 00:16:45,881
HE'S LYING TO YOU,
MATLIN!

378
00:16:47,466 --> 00:16:49,551
MILES, JUST TELL ME
THE TRUTH.

379
00:16:49,635 --> 00:16:51,220
THE GUY'S A HUGE JERK.

380
00:16:51,303 --> 00:16:52,804
(SCOFFS)

381
00:16:54,223 --> 00:16:55,724
SERIOUSLY?

382
00:16:58,519 --> 00:16:59,603
CAN WE NOT DO THIS HERE?

383
00:16:59,686 --> 00:17:01,730
NO, JUST ANSWER
THE QUESTION.

384
00:17:01,813 --> 00:17:04,316
DID YOU TELL ON ZIG?

385
00:17:04,399 --> 00:17:05,400
I WAS WORRIED ABOUT YOU,
MAYA.

386
00:17:05,484 --> 00:17:08,445
YOU HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT HIS LIFE IS LIKE!

387
00:17:08,529 --> 00:17:11,990
YOU HAVE NO CLUE
HOW HARD IT IS FOR HIM!

388
00:17:12,074 --> 00:17:14,493
ARE YOU SERIOUSLY
DEFENDING HIM RIGHT NOW?!

389
00:17:14,576 --> 00:17:15,994
YOU KNOW WHAT
HE SAID TO ME?!

390
00:17:16,078 --> 00:17:17,621
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU'D DO
SOMETHING SO SPITEFUL

391
00:17:17,704 --> 00:17:20,040
JUST BECAUSE WHAT,
YOU WERE JEALOUS?

392
00:17:20,123 --> 00:17:21,416
BECAUSE HE'S FOOLING YOU,
MAYA,

393
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:23,293
AND YOU'RE FALLING
FOR IT!

394
00:17:23,377 --> 00:17:24,795
THE ONLY THING
I FELL FOR

395
00:17:24,878 --> 00:17:25,796
WAS BELIEVING
THAT YOU WERE SOMEONE

396
00:17:25,879 --> 00:17:27,798
THAT I COULD ACTUALLY
BE WITH!

397
00:17:29,967 --> 00:17:31,468
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

398
00:17:34,346 --> 00:17:38,141
I'M SAYING THAT I NEED
SOME TIME TO THINK.

399
00:17:38,225 --> 00:17:39,309
SO YOU'RE CHOOSING HIM.

400
00:17:39,393 --> 00:17:40,894
IT'S NOT LIKE THAT!

401
00:17:43,313 --> 00:17:44,815
WHATEVER YOU SAY.

402
00:18:00,873 --> 00:18:02,374
(SIGHS)
YOUR SUBJECTS AWAIT.

403
00:18:03,333 --> 00:18:05,502
ON WHAT,
ANOTHER STRIP SHOW?!

404
00:18:05,586 --> 00:18:08,380
WELL, AT LEAST
IT WASN'T BOTH BOOBS.

405
00:18:08,463 --> 00:18:09,631
IS THAT SUPPOSED
TO MAKE ME FEEL BETTER?

406
00:18:09,715 --> 00:18:11,216
YES?

407
00:18:12,092 --> 00:18:13,594
(HUFFS)

408
00:18:21,185 --> 00:18:21,768
I CAN'T BELIEVE
I LET THOSE NINER GIRLS

409
00:18:21,852 --> 00:18:24,479
GET TO ME.

410
00:18:24,563 --> 00:18:26,398
CONNOR MUST THINK
I'M AN IDIOT!

411
00:18:29,318 --> 00:18:31,278
SOMEHOW,
I DON'T THINK HE DOES.

412
00:18:31,361 --> 00:18:32,863
(ALLI LAUGHS)

413
00:18:37,034 --> 00:18:38,869
I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT WANT
TO CHANGE.

414
00:18:38,952 --> 00:18:40,621
THANKS.

415
00:18:40,704 --> 00:18:41,955
WHY DID YOU WEAR
A GARMENT

416
00:18:42,039 --> 00:18:44,416
THAT COULDN'T CONTAIN
YOUR AMPLE BOSOM?

417
00:18:44,499 --> 00:18:46,418
WELL, YOU SAID
YOU LIKED IT!

418
00:18:49,213 --> 00:18:51,882
BUT OKAY, REALLY...

419
00:18:51,965 --> 00:18:52,758
BECAUSE THOSE STUPID
LITTLE GIRLS

420
00:18:52,841 --> 00:18:54,843
WERE TRYING
TO GET WITH YOU!

421
00:18:54,927 --> 00:18:56,762
THEY ONLY LIKE ME NOW THAT
I'M CONVENTIONALLY DRESSED.

422
00:18:56,845 --> 00:18:59,264
YOU LIKED ME
BEFORE THEN.

423
00:18:59,348 --> 00:19:02,017
BESIDES, I DON'T LOVE
ANY OF THOSE OTHER GIRLS.

424
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:03,685
YOU LOVE ME?

425
00:19:03,769 --> 00:19:06,730
YES, AND I HOPE
YOU RECIPROCATE.

426
00:19:06,813 --> 00:19:09,066
YES, OF COURSE
I RECIPROCATE!

427
00:19:09,149 --> 00:19:11,568
CONNOR, I LOVE YOU,

428
00:19:11,652 --> 00:19:13,153
JUST THE WAY YOU ARE.

429
