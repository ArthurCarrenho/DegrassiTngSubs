1
00:00:01,950 --> 00:00:05,020
GOOD MORNING, DEGRASSI. I'M LIBERTY VAN ZANDT.

2
00:00:05,053 --> 00:00:06,855
CONGRATS THIS MORNING TO TOBY ISAACS

3
00:00:06,889 --> 00:00:08,323
AND HIS COMPUTER PROGRAMMING TEAM.

4
00:00:08,357 --> 00:00:12,027
THANKS TO THEM, DEGRASSI PLACED THIRD IN THE REGIONALS!

5
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:13,362
NICE WORK, TOBY.

6
00:00:13,395 --> 00:00:14,396
THE CHESS CLUB IS ALSO ON A WINNING STREAK.

7
00:00:14,429 --> 00:00:16,698
THEY PLACED SECOND IN THE ALL CITY FINALS

8
00:00:16,732 --> 00:00:19,368
WHICH WERE SIMULTANEOUSLY BROADCAST ON THE INTERNET...

9
00:00:19,401 --> 00:00:20,235
THAT'S IT?

10
00:00:21,069 --> 00:00:22,237
NASCAR IS EXCITING.

11
00:00:22,271 --> 00:00:24,306
BRITNEY IN A HOT TUB? THAT'S EXCITING.

12
00:00:24,339 --> 00:00:27,809
THIRD PLACE IN SOME GEEK CONTEST - NOT.

13
00:00:31,947 --> 00:00:33,982
IN SPORTS, FOR ALL BOYS INTERESTED

14
00:00:34,016 --> 00:00:34,950
IN THE WRESTLING TEAM,

15
00:00:34,983 --> 00:00:37,152
THERE'S A MEETING AFTER SCHOOL IN THE GYM.

16
00:00:37,185 --> 00:00:39,821
SPEAKING OF WRESTLING, LAST YEAR'S CHAMPION, SEAN CAMERON,

17
00:00:39,855 --> 00:00:42,925
HAS BEEN NAMED THIS MONTH'S OVERALL SPORTS MVP

18
00:00:42,958 --> 00:00:43,959
BY THE STUDENTS' ATHLETIC ASSOCIATION.

19
00:00:43,992 --> 00:00:45,928
THAT'S FANTASTIC, SEAN!

20
00:00:49,431 --> 00:00:50,899
NICE TO BE HIM.

21
00:00:54,136 --> 00:00:56,305
FORGET IT. JUST FORGET IT.

22
00:00:59,942 --> 00:01:01,877
♪ Whatever it takes

23
00:01:03,312 --> 00:01:06,148
♪ I know I can make it through

24
00:01:08,784 --> 00:01:10,185
♪ If I hold out

25
00:01:11,253 --> 00:01:12,254
♪ If I do...

26
00:01:12,287 --> 00:01:15,123
♪ I know I can make it through

27
00:01:20,429 --> 00:01:21,930
♪ Be the best

28
00:01:21,964 --> 00:01:24,299
♪ The best that I can be

29
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:27,836
♪ Hear what I say to you

30
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:31,039
♪ Whatever it takes

31
00:01:31,073 --> 00:01:32,841
♪ I can see it

32
00:01:32,874 --> 00:01:35,043
♪ I know I can make it

33
00:01:37,012 --> 00:01:39,948
♪ I know I can make it through.

34
00:01:44,353 --> 00:01:48,290
THIS IS DEOXYRIBONUCLEIC ACID OR DNA.

35
00:01:48,323 --> 00:01:51,226
AND DNA MAKES UP YOUR GENES.

36
00:01:51,259 --> 00:01:53,428
TAKE ONE AND PASS IT BACK.

37
00:01:53,462 --> 00:01:54,396
YOU DONE SULKING?

38
00:01:54,429 --> 00:01:55,797
I'M NOT.

39
00:01:55,831 --> 00:01:57,165
I JUST EXPECTED -

40
00:01:57,199 --> 00:01:58,967
I DON'T KNOW, SOMETHING.

41
00:01:59,001 --> 00:02:00,736
SOME KIND OF REACTION.

42
00:02:00,769 --> 00:02:01,870
LIKE WHAT?

43
00:02:01,903 --> 00:02:06,375
'OH TOBY, I JUST LOVE A MAN WHO CAN WRITE BINARY CODE.'

44
00:02:06,408 --> 00:02:07,976
BOYS?

45
00:02:08,010 --> 00:02:09,311
CARE TO SHARE WITH THE CLASS?

46
00:02:09,344 --> 00:02:11,046
I WAS JUST WONDERING IF EVERYTHING ABOUT US

47
00:02:11,079 --> 00:02:13,315
IS DECIDED BY DNA?

48
00:02:13,348 --> 00:02:16,885
SOME THINGS. LIKE YOUR EYE COLOUR.

49
00:02:16,918 --> 00:02:17,953
BUT THERE ARE OTHER THINGS ABOUT US

50
00:02:17,986 --> 00:02:21,056
THAT WE HAVE THE POWER TO CHANGE.

51
00:02:21,757 --> 00:02:23,291
OKAY GUYS, REMEMBER TO BRING BACK THESE DIAGRAMS

52
00:02:23,325 --> 00:02:25,794
FOR TOMORROW'S CLASS.

53
00:02:29,998 --> 00:02:31,299
BUT NO ONE NOTICES ME.

54
00:02:31,333 --> 00:02:33,001
SURE THEY DO.

55
00:02:33,035 --> 00:02:34,836
YOU'RE THE LOVEABLE-IF SLIGHTLY-INVISIBLE

56
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:36,838
COMPUTER EXPERT.

57
00:02:36,872 --> 00:02:37,906
THAT'S IT?

58
00:02:37,939 --> 00:02:39,141
WELL. YEAH.

59
00:02:40,542 --> 00:02:43,445
NO BIG DEAL. YOU COULD CHANGE YOUR IMAGE.

60
00:02:43,478 --> 00:02:45,514
YOU COULD MOON THE CAF.

61
00:02:45,547 --> 00:02:46,481
I COULD DYE MY HAIR GREEN.

62
00:02:46,515 --> 00:02:49,051
YOU COULD TAKE UP SNOWBOARDING.

63
00:02:49,084 --> 00:02:51,386
I COULD TRY OUT FOR WRESTLING.

64
00:02:52,821 --> 00:02:54,923
YEAH, NOW THAT'S FUNNY.

65
00:02:54,956 --> 00:02:56,024
NO. BAD TOBY.

66
00:02:56,324 --> 00:02:58,960
NO ONE IGNORES JOCKS, JT.

67
00:02:58,994 --> 00:03:00,962
I THINK IT'S A GREAT IDEA.

68
00:03:04,966 --> 00:03:06,868
WIRELESS WEB ACCESS, EMAIL

69
00:03:06,902 --> 00:03:09,304
AND GPS? TER, YOUR PHONE RULES.

70
00:03:11,506 --> 00:03:12,908
THE SALESMAN SAID IT WAS THE BEST.

71
00:03:12,941 --> 00:03:14,443
TER!

72
00:03:15,077 --> 00:03:17,312
OKAY, HON. WE GROW TIRED OF YOUR GAMES.

73
00:03:17,345 --> 00:03:18,246
YOU GOT TO SPILL.

74
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:19,915
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

75
00:03:19,948 --> 00:03:21,049
A NEW COAT TWO DAYS AGO A NEW COAT.

76
00:03:21,083 --> 00:03:22,217
YESTERDAY, A NEW BAG.

77
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:24,286
TODAY, A NEW CELL PHONE.

78
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:26,121
WE WON'T STAND FOR IT ANY LONGER.

79
00:03:26,154 --> 00:03:27,889
MY DAD MADE SOME EXTRA MONEY.

80
00:03:27,923 --> 00:03:29,057
WHAT? DID HE ROB A BANK?

81
00:03:29,091 --> 00:03:30,792
PAIGE, GET OFF HER BACK.

82
00:03:30,826 --> 00:03:33,962
I WILL. WHEN SHE TELLS ME WHERE THE MONEY'S COMING FROM.

83
00:03:33,995 --> 00:03:36,798
I FORGOT MY LUNCH IN MY LOCKER.

84
00:03:43,105 --> 00:03:44,940
CAN YOU BELIEVE HER?

85
00:03:44,973 --> 00:03:47,042
OKAY, CALL ME CRAZY BUT -

86
00:03:48,977 --> 00:03:53,081
DO YOU THINK TERRI'S GOT A BAD CASE OF STICKY FINGERS?

87
00:03:53,115 --> 00:03:55,317
MORE LIKE, SHOPLIFTING?

88
00:04:00,155 --> 00:04:02,057
TOBY, YOU REALIZE YOU'LL GET KILLED.

89
00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:04,092
CREAMED. SQUASHED. MURDERIZED.

90
00:04:04,126 --> 00:04:05,127
QUIT IT, JT.

91
00:04:05,927 --> 00:04:07,996
I'M JUST BEING REALISTIC.

92
00:04:08,029 --> 00:04:09,898
REMEMBER WHAT HAPPENED IN GYM YESTERDAY?

93
00:04:09,931 --> 00:04:12,901
THAT'S BECAUSE ALL I EVER DO IS SIT IN FRONT OF A COMPUTER.

94
00:04:12,934 --> 00:04:13,802
UH-HUH?

95
00:04:13,835 --> 00:04:14,503
SO IF I GO OUT FOR WRESTLING

96
00:04:14,536 --> 00:04:16,571
I'M GOING TO HAVE TO GET FIT.

97
00:04:16,605 --> 00:04:19,040
AND NO ONE WILL EVER LAUGH AT ME AGAIN.

98
00:04:19,074 --> 00:04:20,408
TOBY...

99
00:04:20,442 --> 00:04:22,844
DO YOU HAVE YOUR KEYS? I WON'T BE HOME AFTER SCHOOL.

100
00:04:22,878 --> 00:04:25,013
FOR YOUR INFORMATION, VAMPIRE,

101
00:04:25,046 --> 00:04:27,415
I HAVE WRESTLING PRACTICE AFTER SCHOOL.

102
00:04:27,449 --> 00:04:29,284
YOU? WRESTLING? RIGHT.

103
00:04:32,988 --> 00:04:34,389
DON'T SAY A WORD.

104
00:04:34,422 --> 00:04:36,424
I CAN MAKE THE TEAM, JT.

105
00:04:38,593 --> 00:04:40,061
SECRET ADMIRER?

106
00:04:40,095 --> 00:04:42,197
NO. JUST A FRIEND.

107
00:04:42,230 --> 00:04:44,232
JUST HER PAROLE OFFICER.

108
00:04:46,001 --> 00:04:48,003
OKAY, TER. WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL US?

109
00:04:48,036 --> 00:04:49,037
TELL YOU WHAT?

110
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:50,138
YOU DON'T KNOW?

111
00:04:50,172 --> 00:04:52,974
OKAY, COME WITH ME. I'VE GOTTA SHOW YOU SOMETHING.

112
00:04:53,008 --> 00:04:53,875
NOT THAT AGAIN.

113
00:04:53,909 --> 00:04:55,844
I MEANT OUTSIDE. C'MON.

114
00:05:01,383 --> 00:05:04,619
TERRI MCGREGOR. UNDERCOVER SUPER-MODEL.

115
00:05:04,653 --> 00:05:07,055
TER, YOU LOOK FABULOUS.

116
00:05:07,088 --> 00:05:09,424
HON, WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL US?

117
00:05:10,058 --> 00:05:11,993
WHY? BECAUSE I'M FAT.

118
00:05:13,094 --> 00:05:14,996
TER. THERE'S NOTHING TO BE ASHAMED OF.

119
00:05:15,030 --> 00:05:15,897
AT ALL.

120
00:05:15,931 --> 00:05:17,098
YOU'RE A MODEL.

121
00:05:17,132 --> 00:05:19,267
YEAH, IN A HUGE AD CAMPAIGN.

122
00:05:20,936 --> 00:05:23,004
YO BELUGA!

123
00:05:23,605 --> 00:05:25,240
YO, SHUT UP, MORON.

124
00:05:25,273 --> 00:05:29,177
HEY, THE PHOTOGRAPHER USE THE WIDE-ANGLE LENS OR WHAT?

125
00:05:29,211 --> 00:05:30,178
YES, LOSER.

126
00:05:30,212 --> 00:05:32,948
JUST LIKE YOU NEED A MICROSCOPE TO FIND YOUR--

127
00:05:32,981 --> 00:05:35,250
I WAS GOING TO SAY "BRAIN"!

128
00:05:45,227 --> 00:05:46,094
OH, MAN.

129
00:05:48,096 --> 00:05:49,998
TOBY!

130
00:05:50,031 --> 00:05:50,565
YOU LOST?

131
00:05:52,067 --> 00:05:54,469
NO. NO, I'M HERE FOR WRESTLING.

132
00:05:56,371 --> 00:05:57,472
OKAY, GUYS, LISTEN UP.

133
00:05:57,505 --> 00:05:58,607
NOW THE TRY OUTS ARE NEXT WEEK.

134
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:00,508
AND AS YOU KNOW, WE ONLY HAVE ROOM FOR ONE WRESTLER

135
00:06:00,542 --> 00:06:02,611
IN EACH WEIGHT CLASS.

136
00:06:02,644 --> 00:06:05,247
SO, LET'S GET STARTED. ANDREWS?

137
00:06:09,084 --> 00:06:10,418
51 KILOS - GOOD.

138
00:06:12,387 --> 00:06:13,455
ISAACS?

139
00:06:18,159 --> 00:06:19,094
55.

140
00:06:19,427 --> 00:06:20,762
SHOULD TOBY AND I START?

141
00:06:20,795 --> 00:06:23,064
NO. YOU GUYS ARE IN DIFFERENT WEIGHT CLASSES.

142
00:06:23,098 --> 00:06:25,967
ACTUALLY, ISAACS YOU'RE IN THE 54 TO 57-AND-A-HALF KILO CLASS.

143
00:06:26,001 --> 00:06:27,335
UP AGAINST - SEAN.

144
00:06:46,655 --> 00:06:51,493
TEN MINUTES LEFT. SO, USE THIS TIME FOR INTERNET RESEARCH.

145
00:06:53,795 --> 00:06:57,065
HEY, I FOUND THE BEST WRESTLING SITE.

146
00:07:01,603 --> 00:07:04,005
MAYBE IN A FEW YEARS I COULD BE LIKE THIS GUY.

147
00:07:04,039 --> 00:07:05,206
UH, EARTH TO TOBY.

148
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:08,743
LET'S JUST CONCENTRATE ON GETTING YOU ON THE TEAM FIRST.

149
00:07:08,777 --> 00:07:10,645
POINT TAKEN.

150
00:07:10,679 --> 00:07:13,715
HEY, CONGRATULATIONS ON PLACING THIRD IN THE FINALS.

151
00:07:13,748 --> 00:07:15,750
I'M PROUD OF YOU, TOBY.

152
00:07:15,784 --> 00:07:17,786
THAT'S INTERESTING RESEARCH TOPIC, GUYS.

153
00:07:17,819 --> 00:07:19,788
YOU KNOW 'MAKING WEIGHT' IS A PRETTY SERIOUS PROBLEM.

154
00:07:19,821 --> 00:07:22,023
A LOT OF KIDS END UP IN THE HOSPITAL.

155
00:07:22,057 --> 00:07:25,160
WELL, ON THE COMPUTING TEAM WE DON'T 'MAKE WEIGHT' -

156
00:07:25,193 --> 00:07:26,795
WE MAKE PROGRAMS.

157
00:07:26,828 --> 00:07:28,196
ISN'T THAT RIGHT, TOBY?

158
00:07:28,229 --> 00:07:30,098
THAT'S RIGHT, COACH.

159
00:07:31,466 --> 00:07:34,302
I HAVE TO MAKE THE WRESTLING TEAM.

160
00:08:09,571 --> 00:08:10,472
THIS IS MURDER.

161
00:08:10,505 --> 00:08:12,741
THREE DAYS AND I'VE ONLY LOST ONE POUND.

162
00:08:12,774 --> 00:08:14,342
DING! LOSING ATTITUDE!

163
00:08:14,376 --> 00:08:17,078
YOUR PENALTY? THIRTY CRUNCHES.

164
00:08:17,812 --> 00:08:19,047
AH! UNCLE!

165
00:08:19,647 --> 00:08:22,150
FINE, WE'LL GET A DRINK FIRST.

166
00:08:28,223 --> 00:08:30,458
TAKE IT FROM SOMEONE WHO LEARNED THE HARD WAY -

167
00:08:30,492 --> 00:08:32,827
THOSE AREN'T REALLY CHOCOLATE.

168
00:08:32,861 --> 00:08:35,663
ONLY YOU'D MAKE THAT MISTAKE.

169
00:08:35,697 --> 00:08:38,600
I'M JUST HERE FOR A GOOD ENERGY BAR.

170
00:08:38,633 --> 00:08:43,138
UH, LAXATIVES - SO TASTY GOING IN, SO NASTY GOING OUT.

171
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:18,706
MATCH TO FEIN!

172
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:22,243
WELCOME TO THE TEAM, REGGIE. GOOD JOB.

173
00:09:24,579 --> 00:09:25,747
ISAACS, SCALE.

174
00:09:33,421 --> 00:09:34,689
53 KILOS?

175
00:09:36,858 --> 00:09:38,526
THAT'S QUITE A LOSS.

176
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,628
I'M TRAINING HARD, COACH.

177
00:09:42,831 --> 00:09:46,401
YOU KNOW ANY PLAYER CAUGHT 'MAKING WEIGHT' WILL BE CUT.

178
00:09:46,434 --> 00:09:48,837
WOULDN'T DO ANYTHING SO STUPID.

179
00:09:49,571 --> 00:09:50,238
ANDREWS?

180
00:09:51,206 --> 00:09:54,909
LOOKS LIKE YOU GOT COMPETITION. LET'S GO.

181
00:10:00,215 --> 00:10:00,782
SHAKE HANDS.

182
00:10:00,815 --> 00:10:01,850
GOOD LUCK.

00:10:46,794 --> 00:10:48,363
SOMEONE'S IN A GOOD MOOD.

187
00:10:48,396 --> 00:10:51,966
TODAY MARKS A NEW CHAPTER IN THE BOOK OF TOBY ISAACS.

188
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,969
MAKING THE WRESTLING TEAM IS THAT IMPORTANT TO YOU?

189
00:10:55,003 --> 00:10:57,505
YES. BECAUSE NOW, I AM A JOCK.

190
00:10:57,939 --> 00:11:00,408
NERD TOBY IS NO MORE.

191
00:11:00,842 --> 00:11:03,645
WELL, JOCKSTRAP - THERE ARE TWO OF THOSE GIANT

00:11:06,881 --> 00:11:08,216
NOT HUNGRY.

194
00:11:09,350 --> 00:11:12,353
THAT'S WHAT YOU SAID YESTERDAY. AND THE DAY BEFORE THAT.

195
00:11:12,387 --> 00:11:13,655
THANK YOU, MOM.

196
00:11:17,358 --> 00:11:18,927
SO YOU'RE NOT HAVING BREAKFAST.

197
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:23,798
NO. NOW, GO BACK TO SIPPING YOUR BLOOD AND LEAVE ME ALONE.

198
00:11:28,469 --> 00:11:31,639

YEAH, SURE.

203
00:11:43,084 --> 00:11:45,453
IT'S A MOMENTOUS OCCASION.

204
00:11:51,926 --> 00:11:52,927
OKAY, NOW, KENDRA -

205
00:11:52,961 --> 00:11:56,764

GRAB MY ARM IF YOU WANT.

207
00:11:58,967 --> 00:12:00,802
UM, I THINK I'LL PASS.

208
00:12:03,771 --> 00:12:05,440
SO - BIG MEET TODAY.

209
00:12:06,608 --> 00:12:07,642
WE'LL BE THERE TO CHEER YOU ON.

210
00:12:07,675 --> 00:12:11,713

214
00:12:23,424 --> 00:12:24,926
CATCH YA, LAY-TAH?

215
00:12:26,127 --> 00:12:28,663
THAT'S HOW WRESTLERS TALK.

216
00:12:28,696 --> 00:12:29,631
COOL - NOT.

217
00:12:31,532 --> 00:12:32,900
WHAT? JEALOUS BECAUSE I'M ON A TEAM,

218
00:12:32,934 --> 00:12:35,003
WHILE YOU'RE JUST A MASCOT?

219
00:12:35,903 --> 00:12:36,404
GREAT.

220
00:12:41,776 --> 00:12:43,511
THIS MINI-SKIRT PHOTO IS WOW!

221
00:12:43,544 --> 00:12:44,679
I'D TOTALLY WEAR IT,

222
00:12:44,712 --> 00:12:46,614
IF I WAS A "PLUS".

223
00:12:46,648 --> 00:12:48,016
SO, WHEN'S THE NEXT SHOOT?

224
00:12:48,049 --> 00:12:50,518
TODAY. BUT MY AGENT CALLED AND CANCELLED.

225
00:12:50,551 --> 00:12:53,121
HOW NICE, ANOTHER LIE FROM MS. MCGREGOR.

226
00:12:53,154 --> 00:12:54,622
IT'S NOT A LIE.

227
00:12:55,623 --> 00:12:57,692
I DON'T WANT TO GO, OKAY?

228
00:12:58,126 --> 00:13:01,696
NOT OKAY. YOU'RE IN A NATIONAL AD CAMPAIGN.

229
00:13:01,729 --> 00:13:03,865
IT WASN'T NATIONAL WHEN I AGREED TO DO IT.

230
00:13:03,898 --> 00:13:04,966
SO THAT'S IT?

231
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:07,468
THAT -

232
00:13:08,403 --> 00:13:09,837
AND WHAT MOHAMMED SAID.

233
00:13:09,871 --> 00:13:14,008
MORNING, GANG. FIVE SECONDS TO HOME ROOM LIFT-OFF.

234
00:13:14,042 --> 00:13:16,744
TER, WHO CARES WHAT MOHAMMED SAID?

235
00:13:16,778 --> 00:13:18,980
THIS DISCUSSION IS NOT OVER.

236
00:13:19,013 --> 00:13:19,947
OH, YES IT IS, PAIGE.

237
00:13:19,981 --> 00:13:22,050
OR, IT WILL BE, IN 3-2-1.

238
00:13:24,686 --> 00:13:24,986
(Bell)

239
00:13:36,798 --> 00:13:38,966
BIG MEET TODAY.

240
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,003
DOING ANYTHING SPECIAL TO GET READY?

241
00:13:42,904 --> 00:13:44,739
MAYBE NOT DOING SOMETHING?

242
00:13:44,772 --> 00:13:46,641
LIKE - NOT EATING?

243
00:13:46,674 --> 00:13:47,942
NOT THIS AGAIN.

244
00:13:48,876 --> 00:13:51,012
TOBY, YOU'RE NORMALLY A GARBARATOR.

245
00:13:51,045 --> 00:13:53,848
I'M JUST NOT HUNGRY THESE DAYS.

246
00:13:54,849 --> 00:13:59,053
FINE. I'LL JUST HAVE TO TAKE IT UP WITH MOM AND JEFF.

247
00:14:00,988 --> 00:14:02,990
BACON CHILI BURGER SUPREME WITH CHUNKY FRIES.

248
00:14:03,024 --> 00:14:05,159
EXTRA SHEILA SAUCE.

249
00:14:05,193 --> 00:14:09,397
HEY, EASY BIG GUY, I GOT TO FEED A WHOLE SCHOOL.

250
00:14:13,568 --> 00:14:15,636
THERE YOU GO, LUMBERJACK!

251
00:14:19,006 --> 00:14:19,140
SEE?

252
00:14:22,009 --> 00:14:22,610
EATING.

253
00:14:23,578 --> 00:14:24,579
HAPPY?

254
00:14:51,973 --> 00:14:52,807
(Vomiting)

255
00:14:54,242 --> 00:14:55,943
TOBY? IS THAT YOU?

256
00:15:01,015 --> 00:15:04,585
SHEILA'S SPECIAL SAUCE AIN'T SO SPECIAL.

257
00:15:04,619 --> 00:15:06,587
COULD YOU LEAVE ME ALONE?

258
00:15:06,621 --> 00:15:09,624
WELL, DO YOU WANT THE NURSE OR SOMETHING?

259
00:15:09,657 --> 00:15:12,593
NO, JUST SOME PRIVACY.

260
00:15:13,094 --> 00:15:13,928
NOW!

261
00:15:21,169 --> 00:15:22,003
(Vomiting)

262
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:26,874
JT?

263
00:15:26,908 --> 00:15:27,875
OH, HEY ASHLEY.

264
00:15:27,909 --> 00:15:31,045
I WONDERED WHEN YOU'D TUNE INTO MY LOVE VIBE.

265
00:15:31,078 --> 00:15:33,047
LET'S SKIP YOUR LITTLE FANTASY.

266
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:34,949
OKAY. LET'S TALK ABOUT YOURS.

267
00:15:34,982 --> 00:15:36,884
JT -

268
00:15:36,918 --> 00:15:38,853
I'M WORRIED ABOUT TOBY.

269
00:15:39,987 --> 00:15:43,825
I KNOW. HE'S BEEN ALL WEIRD AND CRABBY LATELY.

270
00:15:44,225 --> 00:15:46,160
BUT, HE IS IN TRAINING.

271
00:15:47,962 --> 00:15:50,064
TRAINING FOR AN EATING DISORDER.

272
00:15:50,097 --> 00:15:52,033
WHAT? YOU'RE SERIOUS.

273
00:15:52,934 --> 00:15:53,868
YEAH, I AM.

274
00:15:55,203 --> 00:15:56,137
I'M PRETTY SURE TOBY'S A GUY.

275
00:15:56,170 --> 00:15:58,840
I MEAN, THAT'S GIRL STUFF.

276
00:15:58,873 --> 00:16:01,642
NO, IT ISN'T. GUYS CAN HAVE IT TOO.

277
00:16:01,676 --> 00:16:02,310
SO IF YOU NOTICE ANYTHING -

278
00:16:02,343 --> 00:16:04,545
I WANT TO KNOW ABOUT IT.

279
00:16:15,089 --> 00:16:16,891
OKAY - POP QUIZ.

280
00:16:16,924 --> 00:16:18,025
CLICK ON THE 'POP QUIZ' LINK.

281
00:16:18,059 --> 00:16:19,060
YOU HAVE 15 MINUTES.

282
00:16:19,093 --> 00:16:19,861
AND WHEN YOUR TIME IS UP,

283
00:16:19,894 --> 00:16:22,864
THE TEST WILL AUTOMATICALLY END.

284
00:16:29,804 --> 00:16:31,005
ARE YOU OKAY?

285
00:16:31,038 --> 00:16:32,874
DO YOU WANT TO SEE NURSE HENDERSON?

286
00:16:32,907 --> 00:16:35,610
NO. NO, I'M FINE, MR. SIMPSON.

287
00:16:44,085 --> 00:16:44,919
GOOD AFTERNOON STUDENTS,

288
00:16:44,952 --> 00:16:46,053
GO SUPPORT YOUR DEGRASSI WRESTLERS,

289
00:16:46,087 --> 00:16:49,724
AS THEY TAKE ON THE BARDELL TEAM THIS AFTERNOON.

290
00:16:49,757 --> 00:16:51,893
ANNE MARIE, PLEASE?

291
00:16:51,926 --> 00:16:53,995
I NEED TO CANCEL A SHOOT.

292
00:16:55,129 --> 00:16:57,598
YEAH, SHE CAN CALL ME BACK.

293
00:16:57,932 --> 00:16:59,800
TER?

294
00:17:01,402 --> 00:17:04,038
MORE GRRRL CAN FIND A NEW MODEL.

295
00:17:04,071 --> 00:17:05,740
WHY?

296
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:08,042
OKAY, IT'S NONE OF MY BUSINESS.

297
00:17:08,075 --> 00:17:11,646
I JUST THINK IT'S TOO BAD YOU'RE GIVING UP.

298
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:14,982
SPINNER, I DREAMT OF BEING A MODEL FOR YEARS.

299
00:17:15,016 --> 00:17:16,984
BUT NOT "PLUS-SIZE". NOT -

300
00:17:18,953 --> 00:17:20,221
OKAY, SO YOU'RE NOT SOME TWIG.

301
00:17:20,254 --> 00:17:22,023
YOU THINK GUYS REALLY LIKE THAT?

302
00:17:22,056 --> 00:17:23,090
DON'T YOU?

303
00:17:23,925 --> 00:17:25,092
SOMETIMES.

304
00:17:25,126 --> 00:17:28,062
BUT LOTS OF TIMES GUYS LIKE GIRLS LIKE YOU.

305
00:17:28,095 --> 00:17:29,063
WITH A FIGURE.

306
00:17:29,096 --> 00:17:30,765
GIRLS LIKE ME?

307
00:17:30,798 --> 00:17:32,066
YOU MEAN FAT?

308
00:17:32,099 --> 00:17:33,834
TER, YOU'RE PRETTY.

309
00:17:33,868 --> 00:17:35,970
YOU DON'T HAVE TO LIE.

310
00:17:36,003 --> 00:17:36,904
I'M NOT LYING.

311
00:17:36,938 --> 00:17:39,106
TER, YOU'RE REALLY PRETTY.

312
00:17:39,941 --> 00:17:43,010
AND ANYONE WHO TELLS YOU DIFFERENT IS BLIND.

313
00:17:43,044 --> 00:17:43,844
OR JEALOUS.

314
00:17:43,878 --> 00:17:46,714
SO YOU JUST TELL THEM TO SHUT UP.

315
00:18:03,965 --> 00:18:04,298
HEY.

316
00:18:06,734 --> 00:18:08,269
TOBY, YOU LOOK AWFUL.

317
00:18:12,073 --> 00:18:14,141
I CAUGHT YOU YAKKING.

318
00:18:14,175 --> 00:18:15,876
THAT WAS SHEILA'S SAUCE.

319
00:18:15,910 --> 00:18:16,978
THAT WAS YOU.

320
00:18:20,147 --> 00:18:22,016
ASH AND I ARE WORRIED.

321
00:18:22,049 --> 00:18:24,185
YOU'VE BEEN TALKING TO HER? BEHIND MY BACK?

322
00:18:24,218 --> 00:18:26,153
TOBY, DON'T WRESTLE.

323
00:18:26,187 --> 00:18:26,921
WHAT?

324
00:18:26,954 --> 00:18:28,122
DON'T WRESTLE.

325
00:18:29,290 --> 00:18:31,859
THERE'S A GYM FULL OF PEOPLE OUT THERE WAITING FOR ME.

326
00:18:31,892 --> 00:18:34,195
ME - AND I'M GONNA GO IN THERE AND I'M GONNA WIN.

327
00:18:34,228 --> 00:18:37,064
AND NOT THIRD PRIZE IN SOME 'GEEK CONTEST'.

328
00:18:37,098 --> 00:18:39,367
ISAACS? WEIGH-IN! LET'S GO!

329

00:19:12,933 --> 00:19:13,934
SHAKE HANDS.

333
00:19:38,092 --> 00:19:39,293
TOBY?

334
00:19:41,929 --> 00:19:42,763
TOBY?

335
00:19:44,131 --> 00:19:46,067
BUDDY, WAKE UP!

336
00:19:46,367 --> 00:19:47,201
TOBY?

337
00:19:47,234 --> 00:19:47,835
TOBY?

338
00:19:49,236 --> 00:19:49,904
IT WAS SO AWESOME.

339
00:19:49,937 --> 00:19:52,907
HERE, LOOK AT THE TEST SHOTS.

340
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:53,874

00:19:53,908 --> 00:19:54,975
YEAH.

342
00:19:58,946 --> 00:19:59,814
HEY, LOOK WHO IT IS.

343
00:19:59,847 --> 00:20:02,283
IT'S THE MORE-OF-EVERYTHING GIRL.

344
00:20:02,316 --> 00:20:03,984
YOU KNOW WHAT?

345
00:20:04,018 --> 00:20:08,089
I THINK YOU SHOULD JOIN OUR SUMO TEAM. SERIOUSLY.

346
00:20:12,893 --> 00:20:16,030
HEY! MOST GIRLS ON THE PLANET LOOK LIKE THIS,

347
00:20:16,063 --> 00:20:17,398
SO GET USED TO IT!

348
00:20:17,431 --> 00:20:18,599
NO KIDDING.

349
00:20:18,632 --> 00:20:21,936
I MADE 500 BUCKS TODAY AS A PLUS-SIZE MODEL -

350
00:20:21,969 --> 00:20:23,104
YEAH, PLUS-SIZE.

351
00:20:24,138 --> 00:20:26,941
WHAT DO YOU MAKE ICE CREAM BOY?

352
00:20:29,110 --> 00:20:30,978
NICE, TERRI.

353
00:20:39,987 --> 00:20:41,155
HEY, YOU OKAY?

354
00:20:44,024 --> 00:20:46,427
ASH IS ON THE PHONE WITH MY DAD.

355
00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:47,561
HE'S ON HIS WAY.

356
00:20:47,595 --> 00:20:49,830
YOU'RE OFF THE TEAM, RIGHT?

357
00:20:49,864 --> 00:20:52,233
ARMSTRONG CHEWED ME OUT.

358
00:20:52,266 --> 00:20:55,202
HE SAID I WAS PLAYING WITH MY LIFE.

359
00:20:55,970 --> 00:20:57,538
LISTEN, TOBES, YOU CAN CRY IF YOU WANT.

360
00:20:57,571 --> 00:20:59,974
BUT I'M NOT GIVING YOU A HUG.

361
00:21:03,310 --> 00:21:06,413
LEAST I GAVE EVERYONE A GOOD LAUGH.

362
00:21:06,447 --> 00:21:07,915
HARDLY.

363
00:21:07,948 --> 00:21:10,151
NEWS GOT OUT, PEOPLE FREAKED.

364
00:21:10,618 --> 00:21:13,354
EVEN SEAN ASKED IF YOU WERE OKAY.

365
00:21:15,122 --> 00:21:18,058
THE WHOLE SCHOOL'S WORRIED.

366
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:21,529
I HAD A NICE LITTLE CHAT WITH KENDRA.

367
00:21:21,562 --> 00:21:26,033
SHE'S LIKE, 'OH, I HOPE HE'S OKAY. I'M SO WORRIED!'

368
00:21:31,272 --> 00:21:35,009
SO, YOU STILL THINK YOU'RE INVISIBLE, TOBES?
