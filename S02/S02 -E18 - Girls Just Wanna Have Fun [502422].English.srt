00:00:04,018 --> 00:00:06,054
IF I EAT POPCORN, I'LL GET GREASY FINGERS.

3
00:00:06,087 --> 00:00:08,623
AND GREASY FINGERS MEAN A SLIMY KEYBOARD.

00:00:33,615 --> 00:00:37,552

00:01:45,019 --> 00:01:48,556
AND YOU DIDN'T CALL ME? WHO IS IT?

34
00:01:55,330 --> 00:01:59,701
GOT MYSELF A BIT OF A STICKY SITUATION HERE.

35
00:02:01,236 --> 00:02:02,637

HE WANTED TO "CHECK IN" WITH ME.

107
00:05:11,826 --> 00:05:13,995
THIS WHOLE THING IS GETTING REALLY CONFUSING

108
00:05:14,028 --> 00:05:17,231

00:06:01,442 --> 00:06:03,311
SO MAYBE WE SHOULD, TOO.

128

00:06:22,563 --> 00:06:23,898
I'M SORRY.

135
00:06:25,133 --> 00:06:26,234
YEAH, I GET IT.

136
00:06:26,267 --> 00:06:29,103
I CAN'T DANCE 'CAUSE I'M WHITE.

137
00:06:29,137 --> 00:06:30,505
THAT'S NOT WHAT I'M SAYING.

138
00:06:30,538 --> 00:06:31,572
YES IT IS.

139
00:06:31,606 --> 00:06:33,040
POLAR BEARS ARE WHITE.

140
00:06:33,074 --> 00:06:35,877
I'M WHITE. AND YOU'RE RACIST.

141
00:06:35,910 --> 00:06:37,378
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING...

142
00:06:37,411 --> 00:06:40,915
OKAY, I'M NOT SAYING YOU CAN'T DANCE CAUSE YOU'RE WHITE.

143
00:06:40,948 --> 00:06:44,452
I'M SAYING YOU CAN'T DANCE CAUSE YOU SUCK.

144
00:06:46,454 --> 00:06:50,057
FINE. I'M GOING SOLO. YOU'RE FIRED!

145
00:06:53,161 --> 00:06:54,462
YOU CAN'T FIRE ME!

146
00:06:55,429 --> 00:06:57,431
I'M GOING SOLO.

147
00:06:57,465 --> 00:06:59,967
ENJOY THE LEAFS' GAME - ON TV!

148
00:07:06,407 --> 00:07:08,576
I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS WAS ACTUALLY CONSIDERED COOL.

149
00:07:08,609 --> 00:07:10,478
I DON'T KNOW, I THINK I LOOK PRETTY GOOD.

150
00:07:10,511 --> 00:07:12,246
I THINK YOU LOOK LIKE A BIG, RETRO LOSER.

151
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:12,914
SHUT UP.

152
00:07:12,947 --> 00:07:13,581
HEY.

153
00:07:14,315 --> 00:07:15,283

00:07:15,316 --> 00:07:17,151
HEY, WHAT'S UP?

155
00:07:18,219 --> 00:07:21,522
THIS IS WHAT THE JUNIOR DANCE IS ALL ABOUT.

156
00:07:21,556 --> 00:07:23,524
SERIOUS IMMATURITY.

157
00:07:23,558 --> 00:07:25,993
NOW HERE'S A HOT LITTLE 80'S RETRO-NUMBER

158
00:07:26,027 --> 00:07:29,297

159
00:07:30,398 --> 00:07:33,067
UGH! I HATE THAT STUPID SONG!

160
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:35,436
WOW EM, YOU HATE EVERYTHING TODAY.

161
00:07:35,469 --> 00:07:38,606
NO - JUST SIMPSON'S TASTE IN MUSIC.

162
00:07:39,173 --> 00:07:42,276
I THOUGHT I SAW YOU GIRLS PLAYING WALLFLOWER BY THE DOOR.

163
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:45,079
THIS GIRL? SHE LIKES TO PARTY ALL THE TIME.

164
00:07:45,112 --> 00:07:47,448
HEAD ON IN.

165
00:07:47,481 --> 00:07:51,252
HOW ABOUT YOU GUYS? YOU GONNA COME IN AND GET DOWN?

166
00:07:51,285 --> 00:07:54,021
WE'RE GONNA MORE LIKE - GET LOST.

167

168
00:07:59,594 --> 00:08:00,394
I'M IN HERE.

169
00:08:00,428 --> 00:08:01,696
CAN YOU FEEL THE EXCITEMENT?

170
00:08:01,729 --> 00:08:04,131
GIRLS' NIGHT IS JUST MINUTES AWAY.

171
00:08:04,165 --> 00:08:06,567
WE'VE GOT ROMANCE, SUSPENSE...

172
00:08:06,601 --> 00:08:09,670

174
00:08:13,474 --> 00:08:15,276
I'M SO SORRY.

175
00:08:15,309 --> 00:08:17,278
I COMPLETELY FORGOT.

176
00:08:17,311 --> 00:08:19,046
MR. SIMPSON CALLED -

177
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:21,415
HE LUCKED INTO LAST MINUTE ELVIS COSTELLO TICKETS AND -

178
00:08:21,449 --> 00:08:24,185
AS YOU KNOW WE BOTH LIVE FOR ELVIS.

179
00:08:24,218 --> 00:08:25,553
GREAT. HAVE FUN.

180
00:08:26,554 --> 00:08:28,689
I'M SORRY. I WAS EXCITED.

181
00:08:28,723 --> 00:08:30,591
WE CAN RESCHEDULE, OKAY?

182
00:08:30,625 --> 00:08:32,493
UNLESS, OF COURSE, ANOTHER ANTIQUE 80'S SINGER

183
00:08:32,526 --> 00:08:34,061
ROLLS INTO TOWN.

184
00:08:35,496 --> 00:08:36,964
SO, HOW WAS YOUR DANCE?

185
00:08:36,998 --> 00:08:39,500
IT SUCKED. THANKS TO THE DJ.

186
00:08:39,533 --> 00:08:42,036
WASN'T MR. SIMPSON DJ'ING?

187
00:08:42,069 --> 00:08:44,572
THAT'S SORT OF MY POINT.

188
00:08:45,106 --> 00:08:47,208
WELL, I'M SURE HE TRIED HIS BEST.

189
00:08:47,241 --> 00:08:50,077
HAVE FUN TONIGHT. I WON'T BE LATE.

190
00:08:53,714 --> 00:08:55,316
IT'S NO BIG DEAL, EM.

191
00:08:55,349 --> 00:08:56,550
NOT TO HER.

192
00:08:58,552 --> 00:09:00,221
YOU KNOW WHAT?

193
00:09:01,555 --> 00:09:04,158
WE DESERVE SOME EXCITEMENT TOO.

194
00:09:06,027 --> 00:09:09,230
WHAT DO YOU SAY WE CRASH THE SENIOR'S DANCE?

195
00:09:09,263 --> 00:09:09,664
AH YES!

196
00:09:17,438 --> 00:09:19,040
WOW...

197
00:09:19,073 --> 00:09:22,276
YOU LOOK EXACTLY LIKE YOUR MOM IN HER HIGH SCHOOL PHOTO.

198
00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:25,379
NO I DON'T, I LOOK LIKE CYNDI LAUPER.

199
00:09:29,417 --> 00:09:30,251
I'M CHANGING -

200
00:09:30,284 --> 00:09:32,453
NO, DON'T! YOU LOOK GREAT.

201
00:09:32,486 --> 00:09:33,421
YOU'RE RIGHT.

202
00:09:33,454 --> 00:09:36,657
WHEN SHE WAS MY AGE MY MOM WAS TOTALLY COOL.

203
00:09:36,691 --> 00:09:39,327
SHE DIDN'T DATE DWEEBS LIKE MR. SIMPSON.

204
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,662
SHE DATED GUYS LIKE CRAIG.

205
00:09:41,696 --> 00:09:43,230
SHE WISHES.

206
00:09:43,264 --> 00:09:45,199
NO. BUT YOU DO.

207
00:09:45,833 --> 00:09:51,105
"OOH CRAIG, I LOVE YOUR EYES. AND YOUR HAIR. AND YOUR SMILE."

208
00:09:54,275 --> 00:09:56,277
WE ARE SO GOING TO HAVE FUN TONIGHT.

209
00:09:56,310 --> 00:10:00,047
WE ARE SO GOING TO SEE CRAIG TONIGHT!

210
00:10:02,350 --> 00:10:04,185
I THOUGHT YOU HAD A DATE TONIGHT.

211
00:10:04,218 --> 00:10:06,287
I DID. SHE CANCELLED ON ME.

212
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,722
STORY OF MY LIFE.

213
00:10:09,724 --> 00:10:11,292
WHO ARE YOU SUPPOSED TO BE?

214
00:10:11,325 --> 00:10:12,326
SID VICIOUS.

215
00:10:13,127 --> 00:10:13,594
UH, WHO?

216
00:10:15,229 --> 00:10:16,597
SID VICIOUS?

217
00:10:16,630 --> 00:10:18,165
THE SEX PISTOLS?

218
00:10:20,101 --> 00:10:23,070
YOU WEREN'T TOO HIP BACK IN THE 80'S, WERE YOU, JOEY?

219
00:10:23,104 --> 00:10:24,739
OH, YOU WANT TO SEE HIP?

220
00:10:24,772 --> 00:10:26,540
OH, I'LL SHOW YOU HIP.

221
00:10:26,574 --> 00:10:27,241
OH YEAH.

222
00:10:28,776 --> 00:10:31,479
SO - YOU GOTTA HOT DATE FOR TONIGHT? GOT SOMEONE SPECIAL?

223
00:10:31,512 --> 00:10:33,247
YEAH, THERE IS THIS ONE GIRL.

224
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:35,750
BUT SHE WON'T BE COMING TONIGHT.

225
00:10:36,283 --> 00:10:39,286
LOOKS LIKE WE BOTH HAVE BAD LUCK TONIGHT.

226
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:41,389
THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT!

227
00:10:41,422 --> 00:10:44,692
WOULDN'T BE AN 80'S DANCE WITHOUT THIS.

228
00:10:45,226 --> 00:10:46,794
THIS IS YOUR DEFINITION OF HIP?

229
00:10:46,827 --> 00:10:48,763
HIP AND COOL. TRUST ME.

230
00:10:50,264 --> 00:10:52,299
NOT SO SURE I WANT TO.

231
00:10:54,468 --> 00:10:57,805
THIS IS SO COOL. WE ARE SO COOL.

232
00:10:59,306 --> 00:11:01,575
RADITCH ALERT!

233
00:11:11,252 --> 00:11:13,521
HEY, YOU DIDN'T EVEN DRESS-UP.

234
00:11:13,554 --> 00:11:17,124
LOOK, THESE GLOVES ARE SO TOTALLY RAD.

235
00:11:17,158 --> 00:11:18,359

WHAT'RE YOU DOING HERE?

241
00:11:35,943 --> 00:11:37,511
WE WANT TO CRASH THE DANCE.

242
00:11:37,545 --> 00:11:38,145

00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:41,515
BUT WE SORTA NEED YOUR HELP.

00:11:47,455 --> 00:11:47,788

251
00:12:43,677 --> 00:12:46,347
IF RADITCH SEES US WE'RE BUSTED.

252
00:12:58,626 --> 00:12:59,894

253
00:13:05,399 --> 00:13:06,534

AND WE'RE SPENDING ALL NIGHT IN THE 80'S,

257
00:13:38,799 --> 00:13:41,502
FROM BEFORE YOU WAS EVEN BABIES.

258
00:13:41,535 --> 00:13:43,904
YOU ARE GOING DOWN, HOMIE.

259
00:13:43,938 --> 00:13:46,540
I'M SO PUMPED. I CAN NAIL THIS!

260
00:13:49,410 --> 00:13:50,277

00:13:58,886 --> 00:14:02,356
SO, AH, WHO'RE YOU SUPPOSED TO BE, VANILLA ICE?

264
00:14:11,498 --> 00:14:13,334
OH. WELL, HOW ARE YOU SUPPOSED TO BREAK IN THAT GET-UP?

265
00:14:13,367 --> 00:14:15,402
WHO'S THE DUMB ONE NOW?

266
00:14:15,436 --> 00:14:17,371
UH YOU ARE - STILL.

267
00:14:17,404 --> 00:14:19,873
YOU SEE, THESE ARE FOR BREAK-DANCING.

268
00:14:19,907 --> 00:14:22,643
YOU MAY HAVE THE GROOVES, BUT UM,

269
00:14:23,677 --> 00:14:25,512
DO YOU HAVE THE MOVES?

270
00:14:56,677 --> 00:14:59,013
WE DID IT!

271
00:14:59,046 --> 00:15:00,514
WE'RE IN.

272
00:15:00,547 --> 00:15:05,052
OH THE SENIORS DANCE. THIS IS THE MOST FUN EVER!

273
00:15:08,155 --> 00:15:09,123
ALRIGHT EVERYBODY,

274
00:15:09,156 --> 00:15:11,058
IT'S TIME FOR THE BREAK-DANCING COMPETITION.

275
00:15:11,091 --> 00:15:12,126
FIRST PRIZE IS THIS:

276
00:15:12,159 --> 00:15:14,461
A PAIR IF PRIMO GOLD SEATS

277
00:15:14,495 --> 00:15:17,097

278
00:15:17,131 --> 00:15:21,602
THAT'S RIGHT. FIRST UP WE HAVE JIMMY BROOKS. JIMMY?

279
00:15:22,469 --> 00:15:24,772
WHAT'D YOU DO WITH MY CLOTHES?

00:15:24,805 --> 00:15:26,640
CLOTHES? WHAT CLOTHES?

281
00:15:27,841 --> 00:15:30,377
ANY DAY NOW, JIMMY.

282
00:15:57,037 --> 00:15:57,638
RRRRIP!

283
00:16:01,675 --> 00:16:02,509
(LAUGHTER)

284
00:16:10,751 --> 00:16:13,887
THAT GIVES A WHOLE NEW MEANING TO DOING THE MOONWALK...

285
00:16:13,921 --> 00:16:17,191
ANYWAY NEXT UP WE HAVE SPINNER MASON.

286
00:16:17,224 --> 00:16:20,594
SPINNER? BRING IT ON, SPINNER...

287
00:16:21,829 --> 00:16:25,833
PARTY PEOPLE, GET READY FOR SOME SERIOUS TUNAGE.

288
00:16:31,205 --> 00:16:32,873
THAT'S NOT MY MUSIC.

289
00:16:33,841 --> 00:16:35,909
DANCE! DANCE!

290
00:16:35,943 --> 00:16:38,679
DANCE! DANCE! DANCE! DANCE!

291
00:17:03,170 --> 00:17:05,839
ALRIGHT IT'S SLOW TIME FOR ALL YOU COUPLES OUT THERE.

292
00:17:05,873 --> 00:17:08,208
HERE IS ONE OF MY FAVORITES.

293
00:17:16,183 --> 00:17:19,853
CRAIG'S HEADED RIGHT THIS WAY.

294
00:17:22,122 --> 00:17:23,624
HEY, CRAIG.

295
00:17:23,657 --> 00:17:25,993
EMMA. MANNY. YOU HAVING FUN?

296
00:17:27,561 --> 00:17:28,562
YEAH.

297
00:17:28,595 --> 00:17:33,167
WE HAVEN'T HAD THIS MUCH FUN SINCE... WELL, NEVER!

298
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:33,901
GREAT!

299
00:17:35,803 --> 00:17:36,804
GREAT.

300
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:43,143
YEAH SO. MANNY YOU, UH, WANNA DANCE?

301
00:17:50,017 --> 00:17:50,484

00:17:58,292 --> 00:18:01,161
YEAH GREAT. YOU TWO DANCE.

304
00:18:02,162 --> 00:18:03,664
I'LL STAND HERE...

305
00:18:50,844 --> 00:18:53,280
EMMA! WHAT ARE YOU DOING OUT HERE?

306
00:18:53,313 --> 00:18:54,848
YOU SHOULD BE IN BED!

307
00:18:54,882 --> 00:18:57,150
REALLY? SO SHOULD YOU TWO.

308
00:18:57,184 --> 00:18:57,584
EMMA!

309
00:19:21,308 --> 00:19:24,011
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU DID THAT TO ME.

310
00:19:24,044 --> 00:19:27,648
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU DID THAT TO ME.

311
00:19:35,022 --> 00:19:37,257
I CAN'T BELIEVE MARCO.

312
00:19:37,291 --> 00:19:39,893
YEAH. HE'S GOT THE TICKETS.

313
00:19:39,927 --> 00:19:42,062
HE'S GOT THE GIRLS.

314
00:19:42,095 --> 00:19:43,830
WHAT HAVE WE GOT?

315
00:19:43,864 --> 00:19:46,934
PAINFUL AND HUMILIATING MEMORIES.

316
00:19:55,075 --> 00:19:56,810
HAVE YOU EVER HEARD OF KNOCKING?

317
00:19:56,843 --> 00:19:58,712
HAVE YOU EVER HEARD OF MANNERS?

318
00:19:58,745 --> 00:20:01,415
I'M NOT THE ON PLAYING TONSIL HOCKEY ON OUR FRONT STEPS.

319
00:20:01,448 --> 00:20:04,084
WHAT ARCHIE AND I DO TOGETHER IS NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS.

320
00:20:04,117 --> 00:20:05,385
AND YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO BE HOME.

321
00:20:05,419 --> 00:20:07,888
NOT DRESSED UP LIKE ME AT SOME DANCE -

322
00:20:07,921 --> 00:20:10,190
I'M NOT YOU, I'M CYNDI LAUPER,

323
00:20:10,223 --> 00:20:12,993
I DON'T CARE WHO YOU ARE, YOU WERE WAY OUT OF LINE TONIGHT.

324
00:20:13,026 --> 00:20:14,027
ME OUT OF LINE?

325
00:20:14,061 --> 00:20:15,829
WHAT ABOUT YOU, NOT TELLING ME ABOUT SIMPSON -

326
00:20:15,862 --> 00:20:16,930
I DID TELL YOU.

327
00:20:16,964 --> 00:20:18,198
YEAH, WHEN IT WAS TOO LATE.

328
00:20:18,231 --> 00:20:21,234
IS IT SO WRONG THAT I'VE FINALLY FOUND SOMEONE I CARE ABOUT?

329
00:20:21,268 --> 00:20:21,735
YES.

330
00:20:21,768 --> 00:20:22,836
WHY?

331
00:20:22,869 --> 00:20:24,905
BECAUSE YOU'VE GOT ME!

332
00:20:28,842 --> 00:20:33,947
EM. YOU'LL ALWAYS BE THE MOST IMPORTANT PERSON IN MY LIFE.

333
00:20:33,981 --> 00:20:35,749
JUST BECAUSE SNAKE AND I ARE DATING

334
00:20:35,782 --> 00:20:38,819
DOESN'T MEAN THINGS BETWEEN US ARE GOING TO CHANGE.

335
00:20:38,852 --> 00:20:41,054
THAT'S NOT TRUE. THINGS ARE ALREADY CHANGING.

336
00:20:41,088 --> 00:20:43,290
YOU, AND MANNY -

337
00:20:43,323 --> 00:20:44,324
MANNY?

338
00:20:46,093 --> 00:20:49,997
WE BOTH LIKE THIS GUY. WE BOTH THOUGHT HE LIKED ME.

339
00:20:50,030 --> 00:20:52,165
AND HE LIKED HER?

340
00:20:52,199 --> 00:20:54,368
I FELT LIKE SUCH AN IDIOT.

341
00:20:57,037 --> 00:21:00,974
I'M SURE SHE DIDN'T PLAN IT, EM. NEITHER DID I.

342
00:21:04,411 --> 00:21:06,079
NICE WORK ON THE DO.

343
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:09,816
YOU DID THIS EVERY SINGLE DAY?

344
00:21:09,850 --> 00:21:10,717
IMAGINE.

345
00:21:16,323 --> 00:21:18,925
SO. ARE YOU GOING TO BE OKAY WITH THIS?

346
00:21:18,959 --> 00:21:20,027
SIMPSON AND ME?

347
00:21:23,330 --> 00:21:24,398
I'M NOT SURE.

348
00:21:27,134 --> 00:21:28,201
THAT'S OKAY.
