1
00:00:03,450 --> 00:00:05,919
MAYBE I SHOULD BRING HAGGIS FOR INTERNATIONAL DAY?

2
00:00:05,952 --> 00:00:08,188
ISN'T THAT MADE FROM STOMACH OR LIVER

3
00:00:08,221 --> 00:00:09,723
OR SOMETHING EVEN GROSSER?

4
00:00:09,756 --> 00:00:12,859
YEAH, BUT IT'S MY SCOTTISH HERITAGE.

5
00:00:12,893 --> 00:00:14,895
TERRI? YOU ARE UNDER ARREST.

6
00:00:14,928 --> 00:00:16,663
FOR WEARING LAST YEAR'S JEANS.

7
00:00:16,696 --> 00:00:17,864
FASHION CRIME!

8
00:00:18,999 --> 00:00:21,868
WELL I KNOW SOMEONE WHO COULD USE A TICKET HERSELF.

9
00:00:21,902 --> 00:00:22,969
ME? A FASHION CRIMINAL?

10
00:00:23,003 --> 00:00:27,274
YEAH - FOR STARTING THE SCHOOL YEAR WITH A MULLET.

11
00:00:28,275 --> 00:00:31,745
BUT YOU GUYS WANT A REAL FASHION CRIME?

12
00:00:33,113 --> 00:00:35,715
DO YOU THINK THEY'RE MAYBE BALD UNDER THERE?

13
00:00:35,749 --> 00:00:39,586
DO YOU THINK MAYBE YOU'RE JUST A BIT IGNORANT?

14
00:00:41,154 --> 00:00:43,123
YOU'RE UNDER ARREST. CRIME?

15
00:00:43,156 --> 00:00:44,624
TERRORIST CHIC.

16
00:00:45,792 --> 00:00:46,993
VERY FUNNY HAZEL.

17
00:00:59,739 --> 00:01:01,141
WELL, OKAY, HAZE?

18
00:01:01,841 --> 00:01:05,979
WHEN I'M OFFENDED YOU KNOW YOU'VE REALLY GONE TOO FAR.

19
00:01:06,012 --> 00:01:10,083
WELL, DRESS LIKE THAT, WHAT DO YOU EXPECT? RIGHT?

20
00:01:12,719 --> 00:01:14,654
♪ Whatever it takes

21
00:01:16,089 --> 00:01:19,125
♪ I know I can make it through

22
00:01:21,361 --> 00:01:22,963
♪ If I hold out

23
00:01:25,131 --> 00:01:27,968
♪ I know I can make it through

24
00:01:33,206 --> 00:01:34,975
♪ Be the best

25
00:01:35,008 --> 00:01:37,143
♪ The best that I can be

26
00:01:38,178 --> 00:01:40,714
♪ Hear what I say to you

27
00:01:41,448 --> 00:01:43,650
♪ What ever it takes

28
00:01:45,352 --> 00:01:47,721
♪ I know I can make it

29
00:01:49,923 --> 00:01:52,759
♪ I know I can make it through

30
00:02:01,434 --> 00:02:04,304
OH, THANK YOU. IT'S NOT EVEN MY BIRTHDAY.

31
00:02:04,337 --> 00:02:06,439
SIR, CAN I HAVE THAT -

32
00:02:06,473 --> 00:02:06,973
LATER.

33
00:02:09,009 --> 00:02:10,043
FIRST UP, A REMINDER THAT TOMORROW

34
00:02:10,076 --> 00:02:12,812
IS GRADE NINE INTERNATIONAL DAY.

35
00:02:12,846 --> 00:02:14,080
SO I EXPECT TO BE DAZZLED BY EACH AND EVERY ONE

36
00:02:14,114 --> 00:02:15,248
OF YOUR DISPLAYS.

37
00:02:15,281 --> 00:02:17,217
WHAT IF YOU DON'T HAVE A CULTURE?

38
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:18,251
GAVIN, WE'VE BEEN THROUGH THIS.

39
00:02:18,284 --> 00:02:19,786
EVERYONE HAS A CULTURE.

40
00:02:19,819 --> 00:02:23,123
SO BRING FOOD, DRESS UP, DO A PLAY -

41
00:02:23,156 --> 00:02:25,191
AND WHAT IF WE DO NOTHING?

42
00:02:25,225 --> 00:02:27,794
NOTHING? I THOUGHT YOU WOULD HAVE BEEN INTO THIS, HAZEL.

43
00:02:27,827 --> 00:02:29,229
BUT - IF NOT?

44
00:02:29,996 --> 00:02:32,999
CLASS PARTICIPATION IS 10 PERCENT OF YOUR MARK.

45
00:02:33,033 --> 00:02:36,036
OKAY - ATTENDANCE. ADEN?

46
00:02:36,069 --> 00:02:38,905
BAZOIAN? BROOKS? CRUIKSHANK?

47
00:02:39,939 --> 00:02:41,941
HAVEN'T YOU STARTED YET?

48
00:02:42,942 --> 00:02:47,781
OH, WELL, IF YOU HAVEN'T, MAYBE I COULD HELP YOU FINISH IT - TONIGHT.

49
00:02:48,381 --> 00:02:52,118
AS IN ME, COMING OVER TO YOUR PLACE, FINALLY.

50
00:02:52,152 --> 00:02:53,453
SURE. MAYBE.

51
00:02:55,321 --> 00:02:58,525
HON, THE COMPLETE LACK OF INVITES CHEZ VOUS?

52
00:02:58,558 --> 00:02:59,392
PARANOIA-INDUCING.

53
00:02:59,426 --> 00:03:01,161
ARE WE BEST FRIEND OR NOT?

54
00:03:01,194 --> 00:03:02,862
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

55
00:03:02,896 --> 00:03:05,031
MICHALCHUK?

56
00:03:05,065 --> 00:03:09,002
I KNOW YOU'RE HERE. TALKING TO HAZEL AS ALWAYS.

57
00:03:25,218 --> 00:03:26,286
I SUCK.

58
00:03:27,487 --> 00:03:30,857
YEAH, YOU MIGHT BE RIGHT ABOUT THAT.

59
00:03:30,890 --> 00:03:34,194
THAT'S YOUR HAND-SEWING PROJECT?

60
00:03:34,227 --> 00:03:35,295
IT'S PERFECT!

61
00:03:36,896 --> 00:03:39,165
YEAH. I GUESS IT'S NOT BAD.

62
00:03:40,166 --> 00:03:41,935
I'D RATHER STICK SEWING NEEDLES IN MY EYES

63
00:03:41,968 --> 00:03:43,369
THAN DO ANOTHER PROJECT.

64
00:03:43,403 --> 00:03:45,105
MORTON'S ASSIGNING MORE TODAY.

65
00:03:45,138 --> 00:03:48,541
YEAH, AND THEY'RE BASED ON HOW WELL WE DID THESE.

66
00:03:48,575 --> 00:03:51,044
I DON'T EVEN CARE. THIS STUFF IS FOR GIRLS.

67
00:03:51,077 --> 00:03:53,079
AND NOT EVEN TRUE, JUST LOOK AT JT -

68
00:03:53,113 --> 00:03:54,180
WHY, LIBERTY?

69
00:03:55,115 --> 00:03:56,182
I'M HORRIBLE!

70
00:03:58,218 --> 00:04:00,553
DOESN'T LOOK LIKE IT, GAY T.

71
00:04:01,121 --> 00:04:03,857
OH, YEAH. NO, NO, THAT'S NOT MINE.

72
00:04:03,890 --> 00:04:04,958
THIS IS MINE.

73
00:04:09,362 --> 00:04:12,165
YOU WIN, MAN. THAT'S THE WORST!

74
00:04:12,565 --> 00:04:15,101
PLEASE HAVE YOUR PROJECTS READY.

75
00:04:15,135 --> 00:04:17,470
MISS SANTOS, IT'S VERY NICE.

76
00:04:19,239 --> 00:04:22,008
HERE, TAKE IT. PRETEND IT'S NOT MINE.

77
00:04:22,041 --> 00:04:24,043
MISS VAN ZANDT?

78
00:04:28,414 --> 00:04:31,584
ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE WORK. WONDERFUL.

79
00:04:32,886 --> 00:04:34,354
UH, THANK YOU, SIR.

80
00:04:34,387 --> 00:04:35,221
MR. YORKE?

81
00:04:37,290 --> 00:04:39,225
PERHAPS WE SHOULD SEND YOU BACK TO GEOMETRY

82
00:04:39,259 --> 00:04:42,328
TO FIND OUT WHAT A SQUARE LOOKS LIKE.

83
00:04:49,903 --> 00:04:50,870
HEY, HOW'S IT GOING?

84
00:04:50,904 --> 00:04:53,206
LAST NIGHT I ASKED MY MOM WHAT MY CULTURE WAS.

85
00:04:53,239 --> 00:04:54,374
SHE POINTED TO THE GLOBE.

86
00:04:54,407 --> 00:04:56,342
SAID I'M FROM EARTH.

87
00:04:56,376 --> 00:04:58,511
IT'S GOOD TO KNOW. I HAD MY DOUBTS.

88
00:04:58,545 --> 00:04:59,913
OH, YEAH! SHE...

89
00:05:03,016 --> 00:05:06,286
OKAY, I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU ARE SO AGAINST INTERNATIONAL DAY.

90
00:05:06,319 --> 00:05:08,054
BECAUSE - WE'RE PEOPLE.

91
00:05:08,087 --> 00:05:09,122
WHY DO WE NEED LABELS?

92
00:05:09,155 --> 00:05:11,524
I AM WEARING FULL UKRAINIAN, DOWN TO MY CHOBOTES,

93
00:05:11,558 --> 00:05:13,059
AND AM I COMPLAINING?

94
00:05:13,092 --> 00:05:16,095
OF COURSE, I DID MAKE A LITTLE UPDATE.

95
00:05:16,129 --> 00:05:18,264
YOU'RE AN INSPIRATION. REALLY.

96
00:05:18,298 --> 00:05:21,034
PLEASE. ALL YOU HAVE TO WEAR ARE SOME CUT-OFF SHORTS.

97
00:05:21,067 --> 00:05:23,336
AND BRING IN LIKE ROTI OR JERK CHICKEN.

98
00:05:23,369 --> 00:05:25,371
I EAT JERK CHICKEN ALL THE TIME

99
00:05:25,405 --> 00:05:27,407
BUT WHY WOULD I BRING IT?

100
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:30,109
WELL, IT'S JAMAICAN ISN'T IT?

101
00:05:30,143 --> 00:05:32,111
JERK CHICKEN? TOTALLY.

102
00:05:32,145 --> 00:05:35,014
AND YOU'RE JAMAICAN. AREN'T YOU?

103
00:05:35,949 --> 00:05:37,483
RIGHT. JAMAICAN, MON.

104
00:05:45,058 --> 00:05:47,560
A REMINDER TO GRADE NINE STUDENTS THAT TOMORROW

105
00:05:47,594 --> 00:05:50,063
IS INTERNATIONAL DAY.

106
00:05:56,035 --> 00:05:58,137
JT! YOU HAVE TO HELP ME!

107
00:05:58,171 --> 00:06:00,573
DID YOU SEE THE PROJECT I JUST GOT ASSIGNED?

108
00:06:00,607 --> 00:06:04,143
YEAH, THE SKIRT THINGY? UH, PIECE OF CAKE.

109
00:06:04,177 --> 00:06:06,980
A WHOLE SKIRT? ON A MACHINE?

110
00:06:07,013 --> 00:06:09,282
YOU CAN DO IT, LIBERTY.

111
00:06:09,315 --> 00:06:12,585
OH RIGHT. YOU SAW WHAT MORTON THOUGHT OF THE PILLOW I DID.

112
00:06:12,619 --> 00:06:15,121
AKA YOUR PROJECT. YOU GOT A D!

113
00:06:16,089 --> 00:06:18,258
WELL, I GOT A D. BUT YOU CLAIMED THE D -

114
00:06:18,291 --> 00:06:21,561
LOOK, LIBERTY, I DON'T CARE, OKAY.

115
00:06:21,594 --> 00:06:23,196
AND YOU'LL BE FINE.

116
00:06:23,229 --> 00:06:25,632
I'LL PROBABLY SEW MY FINGER OFF.

117
00:06:25,665 --> 00:06:27,133
NOT MY PROBLEM.

118
00:06:29,168 --> 00:06:34,107
DON'T MAKE ME TELL THE GUYS YOU'RE THE NEXT MARTHA STEWART.

119
00:06:35,308 --> 00:06:37,377
YOU'RE KIDDING? YOU WOULDN'T.

120
00:06:37,410 --> 00:06:38,478
TRY ME.

121
00:06:42,282 --> 00:06:43,983
FINE, I'LL DO IT.

122
00:06:44,017 --> 00:06:46,185
BUT IF YOU DO TELL ANYONE?

123
00:06:46,219 --> 00:06:48,655
I'LL SEW YOUR FINGER OFF.

124
00:06:48,688 --> 00:06:49,555
THANKS.

125
00:06:49,589 --> 00:06:51,024
NOW, I WAS THINKING A SLIT UP THE SIDE

126
00:06:51,057 --> 00:06:52,425
MIGHT BE CUTE, YOU KNOW,

127
00:06:52,458 --> 00:06:56,162
HAVE BIT OF NICE PLAID FABRIC THERE.

128
00:07:18,685 --> 00:07:20,153
WHAPP'N SWEETNESS?

129
00:07:20,186 --> 00:07:21,254
HEY, WAYNE.

130
00:07:21,287 --> 00:07:22,622
HERE FOR YOUR USUAL CURRIED GOAT?

131
00:07:22,655 --> 00:07:23,723
NO. FOR SCHOOL.

132
00:07:23,756 --> 00:07:26,559
I WANT TO GIVE MY CLASS A TASTE OF THE REAL JAMAICA.

133
00:07:26,592 --> 00:07:28,394
GO FOR THE GOAT. YOU LOVE IT.

134
00:07:28,428 --> 00:07:31,130
I DO. BUT I'M NOT SURE THEY WILL.

135
00:07:31,164 --> 00:07:31,431
AH.

136
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:36,102
HOW'S ABOUT SOME JERK CHICKEN? THAT'S PRETTY SAFE.

137
00:07:36,135 --> 00:07:38,771
PERFECT. HOW MUCH FOR LIKE, 50 PEOPLE?

138
00:07:38,805 --> 00:07:41,474
JUST TO GIVE THEM A TASTE.

139
00:07:42,208 --> 00:07:43,209
TELL YOU WHAT -

140
00:07:43,242 --> 00:07:45,111
SINCE YOU'RE SUCH A GOOD CUSTOMER,

141
00:07:45,144 --> 00:07:46,112
I'LL GIVE YOU A BREAK.

142
00:07:46,145 --> 00:07:47,146
WOW. THANKS.

143
00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:51,951
WHAT'S THIS FOR?

144
00:07:51,984 --> 00:07:55,221
UM, I'M DOING, A PROJECT ON JAMAICA.

145
00:07:55,254 --> 00:07:57,190
THOUGHT I'D GO FOR EXTRA POINTS.

146
00:07:57,223 --> 00:07:59,158
BUT YOU'RE NOT FROM THE ISLAND.

147
00:07:59,192 --> 00:08:01,561
I KNOW. IT'S FOR GEOGRAPHY.

148
00:08:01,594 --> 00:08:02,662
I'VE ALWAYS LIKED JAMAICA.

149
00:08:02,695 --> 00:08:05,098
HOPE TO VISIT SOME DAY.

150
00:08:10,303 --> 00:08:12,238
FOOD - AND DECORATIONS.

151
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:17,243
I SEE AN A-PLUS IN YOUR FUTURE.

152
00:08:30,523 --> 00:08:33,760
THIS IS THE GAVIN MASON 'LITTLE SLICE OF PRIDE.'

153
00:08:33,793 --> 00:08:36,863
RUSSIAN SAUSAGE, POLISH SAUSAGE, AND GERMAN SAUSAGE.

154
00:08:36,896 --> 00:08:39,565
WELL, CERTAINLY A CREATIVE LOOK AT YOUR HERITAGE.

155
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:40,800
WHAT ARE THE WHITE CHUNKS?

156
00:08:40,833 --> 00:08:42,735
OH, THOSE ARE CHINESE WATER CHESTNUTS.

157
00:08:42,769 --> 00:08:44,704
IN HONOUR OF MY SISTER.

158
00:08:45,505 --> 00:08:47,573
HOW LONG DID YOU COOK THIS FOR?

159
00:08:47,607 --> 00:08:50,276
I DON'T KNOW. FIVE MINUTES. WHY?

160
00:08:51,911 --> 00:08:53,813
MISS MICHALCHUK, I HAVE TO COMPLIMENT YOU

161
00:08:53,846 --> 00:08:55,448
ON YOUR UKRAINIAN COSTUME.

162
00:08:55,481 --> 00:08:58,618
I DON'T THINK I'VE SEEN ANYTHING QUITE LIKE IT.

163
00:08:58,651 --> 00:09:00,787
WELL, I HAD TO MAKE SOME MODIFICATIONS.

164
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:02,755
JUST TO BRING IT UP TO DATE.

165
00:09:02,789 --> 00:09:05,191
WELL, IT'S DEFINITELY UP-TO-DATE.

166
00:09:05,224 --> 00:09:07,160
THANK YOU SIR. PEROGIE?

167
00:09:14,867 --> 00:09:17,637
THIS IS EXCELLENT JERK CHICKEN, HAZEL.

168
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:19,505
IT'S MY MOTHER'S RECIPE.

169
00:09:19,539 --> 00:09:20,606
YOU KNOW,

170
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,708
I LIVE BY THE CRESCENT MOON CARIBBEAN RESTAURANT.

171
00:09:22,742 --> 00:09:25,278
SHE'D GIVE THOSE GUYS A RUN FOR THEIR MONEY.

172
00:09:25,311 --> 00:09:27,613
THANKS. MY MOM'S FROM JAMAICA,

00:09:45,798 --> 00:09:48,868
CITIZENS OF THE WORLD - THAT'S LUNCH.

177
00:09:48,901 --> 00:09:50,236
BE BACK HERE IN 45 MINUTES.

178
00:09:50,269 --> 00:09:53,206
WE'LL BEGIN THE PRESENTATIONS THEN.

179
00:10:06,619 --> 00:10:08,387
HAZEL ADEN.

180
00:10:08,421 --> 00:10:09,889
SO, YOU'RE JAMAICAN?

181
00:10:10,723 --> 00:10:12,792
WHAT WAS YOUR FIRST CLUE?

182
00:10:13,359 --> 00:10:15,928
JUST - ADEN. NOT REALLY A COMMON NAME.

183
00:10:15,962 --> 00:10:17,663
MAYBE IN SOMALIA -

184
00:10:19,265 --> 00:10:21,334
REALLY. AND WHAT'S YOUR LAST NAME?

185
00:10:21,367 --> 00:10:23,436
OH, RIGHT - I DON'T CARE.

186
00:10:24,403 --> 00:10:26,839
FUNNY THING IS, YOU SORTA LOOK SOMALIAN TOO.

187
00:10:26,873 --> 00:10:27,974
REALLY?

188
00:10:28,007 --> 00:10:28,908
WELL, WHY DON'T YOU MIND YOUR OWN BUSINESS, FAREEZA.

189
00:10:28,941 --> 00:10:32,912
BEFORE JAMAICA MIGHT DECLARE WAR ON IRAQ.

190
00:10:46,726 --> 00:10:47,927
ANYBODY OUT THERE?

191
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:48,895
NOT A SOUL.

192
00:10:49,595 --> 00:10:50,830
GOOD.

193
00:10:50,863 --> 00:10:55,968
CAN YOU CUT ME A SIX CENTIMETER STRIP OF THAT STUFF, PLEASE?

194
00:10:57,737 --> 00:10:59,839
NO, NO, NO, NO. STOP. STOP.

195
00:10:59,872 --> 00:11:01,274
LOOK, JUST SNIP -

196
00:11:03,042 --> 00:11:03,876
- AND RIP.

197
00:11:05,044 --> 00:11:07,580
YOU NEVER STOP SURPRISING ME, JT.

198
00:11:07,613 --> 00:11:11,817
YOU'RE NORMALLY SUCH - HOW DO I PUT THIS NICELY? -

199
00:11:11,851 --> 00:11:12,451
A SLOB.

200
00:11:13,452 --> 00:11:16,989
OH, THANKS. FIRST YOU BLACKMAIL ME INTO SEWING,

201
00:11:17,690 --> 00:11:18,958
AND THEN YOU INSULT ME.

202
00:11:18,991 --> 00:11:21,861
I'M NOT INSULTING YOU. I'M IMPRESSED.

203
00:11:21,894 --> 00:11:23,563
YOU MUST LIKE IT.

204
00:11:23,596 --> 00:11:26,866
I DON'T LIKE IT, LIBERTY. MY MOM'S A SEAMSTRESS.

205
00:11:26,899 --> 00:11:28,968
I GUESS I JUST GREW UP DOING IT.

206
00:11:29,001 --> 00:11:30,970
LIKE MOTHER, LIKE SON.

207
00:11:31,003 --> 00:11:32,071
YOU SEE, IT'S THAT KIND OF COMMENT

208
00:11:32,104 --> 00:11:35,608
THAT MAKES ME WANT TO PRETEND I'M NOT GOOD AT IT.

209
00:11:35,641 --> 00:11:38,377
WHY ARE GUYS SO WEIRD ABOUT THIS?

210
00:11:39,445 --> 00:11:41,614
I DON'T KNOW. WE JUST ARE.

211
00:11:42,782 --> 00:11:43,382
LOOK, NO MORE QUESTIONS, OKAY?

212
00:11:43,416 --> 00:11:45,518
I'M TRYING TO CONCENTRATE.

213
00:11:45,551 --> 00:11:46,552
SEAM RIPPER.

214
00:11:51,490 --> 00:11:54,527
SPIN, I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU FINISHED TWO SHEILA SPECIALS.

215
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:57,363
YEAH, AFTER DEVOURING THE REST OF THE WORLD BEFORE LUNCH.

216
00:11:57,396 --> 00:11:58,898
I WAS JUST DEMONSTRATING MY APPRECIATION

217
00:11:58,931 --> 00:12:01,801
FOR DEGRASSI'S CULINARY CULTURE.

218
00:12:03,569 --> 00:12:03,970
WHOA.

219
00:12:10,676 --> 00:12:11,410
HOW DID THAT HAPPEN?

220
00:12:11,444 --> 00:12:13,946
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

221
00:12:15,548 --> 00:12:17,416
WHO'S PROJECT IS THAT? IS THAT FAREEZA'S?

222
00:12:17,450 --> 00:12:19,852
THAT'S FAREEZA'S.

223
00:12:43,075 --> 00:12:46,112
A HATE CRIME HAS BEEN COMMITTED HERE.

224
00:12:46,145 --> 00:12:48,848
BY WHO, WE DON'T KNOW.

225
00:12:48,881 --> 00:12:49,882
BUT WE'RE GOING TO FIND OUT.

226
00:12:49,915 --> 00:12:52,618
UNTIL THEN, INTERNATIONAL DAY IS ON HOLD.

227
00:12:52,652 --> 00:12:55,354
ALL CLASSES ARE ON HOLD TOO.

228
00:12:55,388 --> 00:12:56,722
BUT NONE OF US DID IT.

229
00:12:56,756 --> 00:12:57,256
ARE YOU SURE?

230
00:12:57,289 --> 00:12:57,890
YEAH.

231
00:12:57,923 --> 00:13:00,559
NONE OF US ARE LIKE THAT.

232
00:13:00,593 --> 00:13:02,862
SO, TER, YOU DIDN'T MAKE FUN OF FAREEZA'S CLOTHING

233
00:13:02,895 --> 00:13:03,829
THE OTHER DAY?

234
00:13:03,863 --> 00:13:05,064
AND WHAT ABOUT YOU, HAZEL?

235
00:13:05,097 --> 00:13:06,832
ASHLEY, I KNOW YOU'RE UPSET.

236
00:13:06,866 --> 00:13:07,533
JUST BECAUSE FAREEZA'S FROM IRAQ

237
00:13:07,566 --> 00:13:09,602
DOESN'T MAKE HER A TERRORIST.

238
00:13:09,635 --> 00:13:12,038
ASH, PEOPLE ARE SCARED.

239
00:13:12,071 --> 00:13:14,340
I MEAN, WHAT DO YOU EXPECT?

240
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:16,776
SPIN, YOU CAN'T BE SERIOUS.

241
00:13:16,809 --> 00:13:17,943
YOU WANT TO EXPLAIN, JIMMY?

242
00:13:17,977 --> 00:13:20,746
MY NEIGHBOUR HAD HIS BANK ACCOUNT FROZEN THREE TIMES.

243
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:23,149
JUST BECAUSE HIS NAME IS OSAMA.

244
00:13:23,182 --> 00:13:24,984
IS THAT FAIR?

245
00:13:25,518 --> 00:13:26,686
OF COURSE NOT.

246
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:29,121
BUT WHAT DOES THAT HAVE TO DO WITH FAREEZA'S DISPLAY

247
00:13:29,155 --> 00:13:31,090
GETTING TRASHED?

248
00:13:31,123 --> 00:13:33,092
IT'S JUST SOME KID TRYING TO GETTING ATTENTION.

249
00:13:33,125 --> 00:13:35,528
COME ON, SEAN - IT'S HATE.

250
00:13:35,561 --> 00:13:37,396
HATE'S AN INTERESTING WORD.

251
00:13:37,430 --> 00:13:39,165
IT'S LIKE HITLER. HE HATED JEWS.

252
00:13:39,198 --> 00:13:42,401
BOTH MY GREAT-GRANDPARENTS DIED IN THE HOLOCAUST.

253
00:13:42,435 --> 00:13:45,004
MY PARENTS - THEY'RE WHITE. I'M CHINESE.

254
00:13:45,037 --> 00:13:46,706
WE'RE STILL A GREAT FAMILY.

255
00:13:46,739 --> 00:13:50,076
I'M LIVING PROOF THAT RACE DOESN'T MATTER.

256
00:13:50,109 --> 00:13:50,943
INTERESTING.

257
00:13:50,976 --> 00:13:53,412
LOOK NO MATTER WHAT WE SAY IN CLASS.

258
00:13:53,446 --> 00:13:56,048
IT DOESN'T CHANGE ANYTHING.

259
00:13:56,082 --> 00:13:57,450
NICE ATTITUDE.

260
00:13:58,517 --> 00:13:59,585
SPINNER OKAY, I DON'T WANNA BE ALL RACIST,

261
00:13:59,618 --> 00:14:01,887
BUT I DON'T EXACTLY WANNA GET BLOWN OUTTA THE SKY

262
00:14:01,921 --> 00:14:03,989
BY SOME TERRORIST EITHER.

263
00:14:07,193 --> 00:14:09,929
I NEED TO SEE HAZEL IN MY OFFICE.

264
00:14:13,232 --> 00:14:15,501
HAZEL, COULD YOU COME HERE?

265
00:14:21,073 --> 00:14:22,408
WHAT'S GOING ON?

266
00:14:23,175 --> 00:14:24,443
I DON'T KNOW.

267
00:14:28,748 --> 00:14:31,851
BUT, I SPENT THE ENTIRE LUNCH WITH PAIGE AND JIMMY.

268
00:14:31,884 --> 00:14:34,920
AND YOUR THREAT ABOUT JAMAICA DECLARING WAR ON IRAQ?

269
00:14:34,954 --> 00:14:36,188
IT WAS A JOKE!

270
00:14:36,222 --> 00:14:36,956
REALLY?

271
00:14:36,989 --> 00:14:38,124
IT WASN'T FUNNY.

272
00:14:40,559 --> 00:14:43,162
DON'T BLAME BEING HERE ON FAREEZA.

273
00:14:43,195 --> 00:14:44,830
I WANTED TO KNOW EVERYTHING THAT WENT ON.

274
00:14:44,864 --> 00:14:47,700
AND EVERYTHING POINTED TOWARD YOU.

275
00:14:49,969 --> 00:14:54,173
OKAY. I'LL ADMIT - FAREEZA IS NOT MY FAVOURITE PERSON.

276
00:14:54,206 --> 00:14:57,643
BUT I WOULD NEVER DO THAT TO HER DISPLAY.

277
00:14:57,676 --> 00:14:58,611
(Telephone)

278
00:15:00,846 --> 00:15:01,847
YES? YOU DO?

279
00:15:04,817 --> 00:15:08,120
TELL THE POLICE I'LL BE RIGHT THERE.

280
00:15:11,190 --> 00:15:15,161
THE POLICE HAVE CAUGHT THE CULPRITS, IT SEEMS.

281
00:15:15,194 --> 00:15:16,028
WHO ARE THEY?

282
00:15:16,061 --> 00:15:18,063
TWO BOYS IN GRADE 10.

283
00:15:18,097 --> 00:15:19,698
SO, CAN I GO NOW?

284
00:15:21,901 --> 00:15:24,003
WHAT HAPPENED TO FAREEZA'S DISPLAY WAS A LARGE EXAMPLE

285
00:15:24,036 --> 00:15:24,870
OF RACISM.

286
00:15:25,671 --> 00:15:28,107
BUT SMALLER THINGS - LIKE WORDS,

287
00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:30,643
THAT'S WHERE THIS STUFF STARTS.

288
00:15:30,676 --> 00:15:32,778
TAKE YOUR FASHION CRIME TICKET.

289
00:15:32,812 --> 00:15:36,715
ACCUSING FAREEZA OF BEING A TERRORIST.

290
00:15:36,749 --> 00:15:39,885
I'D LIKE TO APOLOGIZE TO YOU ON BEHALF OF THE SCHOOL.

291
00:15:39,919 --> 00:15:43,122
AND INVITE YOU TO RECREATE YOUR DISPLAY IN THE FOYER.

292
00:15:43,155 --> 00:15:43,989
THANK YOU.

293
00:15:46,325 --> 00:15:48,594
I STILL CAN'T BELIEVE THAT COULD HAPPEN AT DEGRASSI.

294
00:15:48,627 --> 00:15:51,831
I'M JUST SURPRISED FAREEZA DID A DISPLAY ON IRAQ AT ALL.

295
00:15:51,864 --> 00:15:52,798
WHY?

296
00:15:52,832 --> 00:15:55,201
WELL, I MEAN IT'S NOT GONNA BE TOO POPULAR.

297
00:15:55,234 --> 00:15:55,768
SO, WHAT WAS SHE SUPPOSED TO DO?

298
00:15:55,801 --> 00:15:57,937
HIDE WHO SHE REALLY IS?

299
00:15:58,771 --> 00:15:59,839
JT...

300
00:15:59,872 --> 00:16:01,774
LOOK, LIBERTY, I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE GONNA SAY, OKAY?

301
00:16:01,807 --> 00:16:03,108
SO DON'T.

302
00:16:03,142 --> 00:16:05,044
YOU HEARD THEM. IT'S WRONG TO HIDE.

303
00:16:05,077 --> 00:16:06,912
IT'S A NATURAL TALENT, JT.

304
00:16:06,946 --> 00:16:09,114
YOU SHOULD BE PROUD.

305
00:16:16,822 --> 00:16:18,657
THAT SKIRT IS SO CUTE.

306
00:16:19,191 --> 00:16:21,227
YOU HONESTLY MADE THAT, LIBERTY?

307
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:22,094
OF COURSE.

308
00:16:26,298 --> 00:16:28,234
DID YOU BRING IT?

309
00:16:28,267 --> 00:16:29,969
I FEEL TERRIBLE ABOUT THIS.

310
00:16:30,002 --> 00:16:31,337
I KNOW.

311
00:16:31,370 --> 00:16:33,172
BUT IT'S MY CHOICE.

312
00:16:34,006 --> 00:16:35,875
OKAY. TIME TO LOOK AT YOUR WORK.

313
00:16:35,908 --> 00:16:37,109
LET'S START WITH MR. YORKE.

314
00:16:37,142 --> 00:16:39,011
WHO GAVE US SUCH AN ENTERTAINING PIECE

315
00:16:39,044 --> 00:16:40,246
OF ART LAST TIME.

316
00:16:42,915 --> 00:16:44,083
IT'S IMPROVED.

317
00:16:45,284 --> 00:16:46,151
YOU'LL NEVER BE A TAILOR, BUT YOU WILL PASS THE COURSE.

318
00:16:46,185 --> 00:16:47,887
THANK YOU, SIR.

319
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:49,221
NOW FOR MISS VAN ZANDT.

320
00:16:49,255 --> 00:16:52,925
I'VE BEEN WAITING ALL DAY. YOUR WORK PLEASE?

321
00:16:58,397 --> 00:17:00,266
LOOK AT THE DRAPERY,

322
00:17:01,267 --> 00:17:02,801
THE PERFECTLY FLAT STITCHING.

323
00:17:02,835 --> 00:17:03,769
IT'S REMARKABLE.

324
00:17:03,802 --> 00:17:06,071
ABSOLUTELY REMARKABLE.

325
00:17:06,105 --> 00:17:07,840
YOU HAVE A REAL GIFT.

326
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:09,875
A TRUE TALENT.

327
00:17:09,909 --> 00:17:11,744
A SEWING GENIUS.

328
00:17:13,012 --> 00:17:14,179
JT SEWED THIS.

329
00:17:14,713 --> 00:17:16,982
HE'S THE GENIUS.

330
00:17:17,016 --> 00:17:17,216
WHAT?

331
00:17:18,651 --> 00:17:19,051
WHAT?

332
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:22,888
SH-SHE'S LYING.

333
00:17:22,922 --> 00:17:23,889
HE'S LYING.

334
00:17:23,923 --> 00:17:25,391
I'M ALL THUMBS, SIR.

335
00:17:25,424 --> 00:17:30,029
COMPARE MY BLOOD TO THAT ON THE PILLOW IF NEED BE.

336
00:17:30,062 --> 00:17:31,130
FORENSICS, SIR.

337
00:17:32,197 --> 00:17:34,066
JT, LIBERTY - WE'LL SORT THIS MESS OUT AFTER CLASS,

338
00:17:34,099 --> 00:17:34,833
SHALL WE?

339
00:17:36,302 --> 00:17:38,237
JT'S A SEAMSTRESS!

340
00:17:38,270 --> 00:17:43,108
COULD YOU MAKE ME A MATCHING BLOUSE, MR. FASHION DESIGNER?

341
00:18:02,728 --> 00:18:04,897
YOU DON'T HAVE TO HELP ME.

342
00:18:04,930 --> 00:18:06,165
DON'T YOU THINK I SHOULD?

343
00:18:06,198 --> 00:18:07,099
NO.

344
00:18:07,132 --> 00:18:09,335
AND I'D PREFER IF YOU DIDN'T.

345
00:18:10,035 --> 00:18:13,706
FAREEZA, I KNOW HOW HARD IT IS TO BE MUSLIM.

346
00:18:15,708 --> 00:18:16,408
ESPECIALLY NOW.

347
00:18:16,442 --> 00:18:19,244
HOW? YOU'RE JAMAICAN, REMEMBER?

348
00:18:20,212 --> 00:18:21,180
MY NAME - ADEN.

349
00:18:23,015 --> 00:18:26,018
YOU SAID BEFORE IT SOUNDED SOMALIAN.

350
00:18:26,418 --> 00:18:29,288
MY NAME SOUNDS SOMALIAN BECAUSE -

351
00:18:29,321 --> 00:18:30,022
IT IS.

352
00:18:31,357 --> 00:18:32,958
THAT'S WHAT I AM.

353
00:18:34,126 --> 00:18:34,727
I KNOW.

354
00:18:37,496 --> 00:18:39,198
AT MY LAST SCHOOL,

355
00:18:42,334 --> 00:18:44,403
SOMETHING HAPPENED TO ME.

356
00:18:47,473 --> 00:18:50,843
I GOT - I GOT CORNERED BY THESE GIRLS.

357
00:18:53,412 --> 00:18:55,147
ONE OF THEM HELD ME -

358
00:18:57,116 --> 00:18:58,417
THE OTHER HIT ME -

359
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:03,255
CALLED ME A TERRORIST.

360
00:19:06,992 --> 00:19:09,395
AND YOU SURE LEARNED FROM THEM.

361
00:19:30,249 --> 00:19:32,384
OH, MR. STITCHERY!

362
00:19:32,418 --> 00:19:34,787
YOU WANT TO MAKE ME A NICE APRON?

363
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:37,956
GO AHEAD, LAUGH IT UP. REALLY FUNNY.

364
00:19:37,990 --> 00:19:39,992
UM, JT, WE WERE WONDERING IF -

365
00:19:40,025 --> 00:19:42,327
YES, EMMA, GIVE IT YOUR BEST SHOT. COME ON!

366
00:19:42,361 --> 00:19:45,764
WE WERE WONDERING IF YOU WOULD MAKE US SKIRTS LIKE LIBERTY'S?

367
00:19:45,798 --> 00:19:47,099
WE'D BE HAPPY TO PAY YOU.

368
00:19:47,132 --> 00:19:48,467
YOU'RE SERIOUS.

369
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:51,003
LIBERTY'S SKIRT WAS REALLY GREAT.

370
00:19:51,036 --> 00:19:52,871
I COULDN'T BELIEVE IT.

371
00:19:52,905 --> 00:19:55,808
WHO KNEW OUR OWN JT HAD SO MUCH TALENT?

372
00:19:55,841 --> 00:19:58,310
LADIES, I'LL BE HAPPY TO OBLIGE.

373
00:19:59,144 --> 00:20:01,013
BUT I WILL HAVE TO MEASURE YOU.

374
00:20:01,046 --> 00:20:02,314
ME FIRST.

375
00:20:08,921 --> 00:20:12,758
HOW ABOUT $35 EACH? OR TWO FOR $60?

376
00:20:19,164 --> 00:20:20,032
GUYS? SETTLE.

377
00:20:22,401 --> 00:20:24,937
WE'RE GOING TO START TODAY A LITTLE DIFFERENTLY.

378
00:20:24,970 --> 00:20:28,907
HAZEL HAS SOMETHING SHE WANTS TO SHOW US.

379
00:20:35,447 --> 00:20:38,016
I LIED TO YOU ALL YESTERDAY.

380
00:20:38,050 --> 00:20:42,354
SOME OF YOU I'VE BEEN LYING TO LONGER THAN THAT.

381
00:20:45,390 --> 00:20:47,459
SO LET ME INTRODUCE MYSELF.

382
00:20:47,493 --> 00:20:49,328
MY NAME IS HAZEL ADEN.

383
00:20:50,329 --> 00:20:53,232
AND I WAS BORN IN MOGADISHU, SOMALIA.

384
00:20:53,265 --> 00:20:54,266
NOT JAMAICA.

385
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:57,102
AND, YES - I'M A MUSLIM.

386
00:20:59,605 --> 00:21:01,440
THESE ARE MY PARENTS.

387
00:21:01,473 --> 00:21:04,843
MY MOM CAME HERE FIRST, WITH ME, TO FLEE A CIVIL WAR.

388
00:21:04,877 --> 00:21:07,913
MY DAD, WHO WAS FIGHTING IN THE WAR, CAME LATER.

389
00:21:07,946 --> 00:21:11,183
FAREEZA WEARS THE HEAD-SCARF THING. HOW COME YOU DON'T?

390
00:21:11,216 --> 00:21:11,884
IT'S A HIJAB.

391
00:21:11,917 --> 00:21:14,453
AND I DO WHEN I GO TO MOSQUE.

392
00:21:15,154 --> 00:21:17,356
BUT TO TAKE IT ON FULL-TIME,

393
00:21:17,389 --> 00:21:20,292
IS A PERSONAL AND IMPORTANT DECISION.

394
00:21:21,627 --> 00:21:24,229
ANYWAY, I'M SORRY I LIED.

395
00:21:25,564 --> 00:21:29,168
UNLIKE YOU GUYS - I WAS ASHAMED OF WHO I AM.

396
00:21:29,201 --> 00:21:30,536
BUT NOT ANYMORE.

397
00:21:34,039 --> 00:21:35,174
(Applause)
