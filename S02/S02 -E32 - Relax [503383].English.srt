1
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,470
OVER HERE LIBERTY! PASS!

2
00:00:12,576 --> 00:00:12,709
YES!

3
00:00:13,877 --> 00:00:18,482
GREAT STUFF, GIRLS. BRING IT IN.

4
00:00:19,917 --> 00:00:22,719
ALRIGHT, THE FINAL ROSTER WILL BE POSTED TOMORROW.

5
00:00:22,753 --> 00:00:24,655
NOT EVERYONE MADE THE CUT.

6
00:00:24,688 --> 00:00:27,457
BUT TODAY I WAS REALLY IMPRESSED WITH ALL YOUR EFFORT.

7
00:00:27,491 --> 00:00:29,526
GOOD STUFF, EVERYONE.

8
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:30,060
YOU READY?

9
00:00:30,093 --> 00:00:31,161
YEAH.

10
00:00:31,194 --> 00:00:34,431
UH, LIBERTY? NICE EFFORT OUT THERE.

11
00:00:34,464 --> 00:00:35,799
I WAS PLEASED WITH MY STICK HANDLING.

12
00:00:35,832 --> 00:00:37,734
THOUGH MY SCORING COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER.

13
00:00:37,768 --> 00:00:39,770
YOU DIDN'T SCORE...

14
00:00:39,803 --> 00:00:40,737
WE'LL NEED TO WORK ON THAT,

15
00:00:40,771 --> 00:00:43,307
IF I'M GOING TO LEAD OUR TEAM TO VICTORY.

16
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:46,944
I KNOW HOW MUCH THIS MEANS TO YOU, BUT I'M SORRY LIBERTY -

17
00:00:46,977 --> 00:00:49,046
YOU DIDN'T MAKE THE CUT.

18
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:50,647
THERE MUST BE A MISTAKE.

19
00:00:50,681 --> 00:00:52,783
I'VE NEVER LOST ANYTHING IN MY LIFE.

20
00:00:52,816 --> 00:00:54,818
WELL, YOU HAVEN'T LOST,

21
00:00:54,851 --> 00:00:56,019
BECAUSE I DO WANT YOU ON THE TEAM.

22
00:00:56,053 --> 00:00:56,987
TO DO WHAT?

23
00:00:57,955 --> 00:01:00,023
THE ROLE OF TEAM MANAGER.

24
00:01:01,825 --> 00:01:03,794
THIS TEAM REALLY NEEDS YOU.

25
00:01:03,827 --> 00:01:06,597
TEAM NEEDS ME? THEN I'M THERE.

26
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:06,930
GREAT.

27
00:01:14,004 --> 00:01:15,939
♪ Whatever it takes

28
00:01:17,741 --> 00:01:20,777
♪ I know I can make it through

29
00:01:22,946 --> 00:01:24,748
♪ If I hold out

30
00:01:26,883 --> 00:01:29,720
♪ I know I can make it through

31
00:01:34,825 --> 00:01:36,426
♪ Be the best

32
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:38,795
♪ The best that I can be

33
00:01:39,763 --> 00:01:42,299
♪ Hear what I say to you

34
00:01:42,966 --> 00:01:44,968
♪ What ever it takes

35
00:01:46,837 --> 00:01:49,006
♪ I know I can make it

00:01:51,575 --> 00:01:54,411
♪ I know I can make it through

37
00:02:01,985 --> 00:02:03,620
AWESOME. I MADE IT!

38
00:02:03,654 --> 00:02:06,390
GREAT. NOW FOR THE INITIATION.

39
00:02:06,423 --> 00:02:07,824
INITIATION?

40
00:02:08,659 --> 00:02:09,493
AHH!

41
00:02:17,868 --> 00:02:20,070
CONGRATULATIONS, ONE AND ALL.

42
00:02:20,103 --> 00:02:24,107
THANKS - SORRY YOU DIDN'T MAKE THE TEAM.

43
00:02:24,141 --> 00:02:25,976
BUT YOU'RE MANAGER - THAT'S GOOD.

44
00:02:26,009 --> 00:02:27,811
THAT'S GREAT.

45
00:02:27,844 --> 00:02:32,449
AND BELIEVE ME, I'M GONNA KEEP YOU GIRLS IN LINE.

46
00:02:35,185 --> 00:02:38,422
THE OUTLINE FOR YOUR ESSAY IS STRONG AND THOUGHT-PROVOKING.

47
00:02:38,455 --> 00:02:40,023
NAPOLEON WAS FASCINATING.

48
00:02:40,057 --> 00:02:42,559
I ONLY HOPE MY ESSAY DOES HIM JUSTICE.

49
00:02:42,592 --> 00:02:43,560
I'M SURE IT WILL.

50
00:02:43,593 --> 00:02:45,929
YOU ALWAYS ACCOMPLISH WHAT YOU SET OUT TO DO.

51
00:02:45,962 --> 00:02:49,032
NOT ALWAYS. BUT THANK YOU, SIR.

52
00:02:52,002 --> 00:02:54,705
A STRONG FATE LINE MEANS YOU KNOW WHAT YOU WANT TO DO.

53
00:02:54,738 --> 00:02:57,074
BUT MY LIFE LINE'S SO FAINT.

54
00:02:57,107 --> 00:02:59,976
YOUR QUEST FOR MEANING WILL BE AN ETERNAL ONE.

55
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:01,745
DIDN'T YOU LEARN ANYTHING LAST YEAR?

56
00:03:01,778 --> 00:03:04,781
ABOUT PLAYING WITH DARK MAGIC?

57
00:03:05,816 --> 00:03:09,453
WOW, DEJA VU. FREAKY OCCULT - AND ASH FREAKING OUT.

58
00:03:09,486 --> 00:03:11,121
YOU HAVE TO HAVE A LITTLE RESPECT.

59
00:03:11,154 --> 00:03:16,860
AND I HAVE TO HAVE A LITTLE FUN. SO, TER - READ THE PALM.

60
00:03:16,893 --> 00:03:18,495
WHAT'S IT SAY, MYSTIC ORACLE?

61
00:03:18,528 --> 00:03:20,997
IT'S GREAT. YOUR PALM'S PERFECT.

62
00:03:23,734 --> 00:03:26,937
UM, HON? I WAS KINDA LOOKING FOR A READING?

63
00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:28,071
MORNING CLASS.

64
00:03:28,105 --> 00:03:33,043
LET'S OPEN OUR TEXTBOOKS TO CHAPTER TWELVE: POLYNOMIALS.

65
00:03:33,076 --> 00:03:34,878
WHAT DO YOU SEE, TERRI?

66
00:03:34,911 --> 00:03:39,182
I SEE PAIGE MICHALCHUK, IN DETENTION, AFTER SCHOOL.

67
00:03:42,652 --> 00:03:43,653
TER.

68
00:03:46,857 --> 00:03:50,026
YOU'VE BEEN AVOIDING ME ALL DAY.

69
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:52,229
NOT YOU. PAIGE.

70
00:03:52,262 --> 00:03:53,096
WHY?

71
00:03:54,231 --> 00:03:57,601
YOUR FATE LINE WAS REALLY FAINT.

72
00:03:57,634 --> 00:04:00,604
PAIGE'S LIFE LINE DOESN'T EXIST.

73
00:04:00,637 --> 00:04:01,972
HER DAYS ARE NUMBERED?

74
00:04:02,005 --> 00:04:04,007
WHOSE DAYS ARE NUMBERED?

75
00:04:06,843 --> 00:04:09,479
EITHER YOU TELL ME WHAT YOU SAW IN MY PALM,

76
00:04:09,513 --> 00:04:12,082
OR MY NAILS GET UP CLOSE AND PERSONAL WITH YOUR FACE.

77
00:04:12,115 --> 00:04:13,950
OKAY. YOUR PALM.

78
00:04:16,253 --> 00:04:17,854
NO LIFE LINE.

79
00:04:20,891 --> 00:04:22,559
YOU'RE GOING TO DIE.

80
00:04:35,672 --> 00:04:41,077
LIBERTY! LIBERTY! LIBERTY! LIBERTY! LIBERTY! LIBERTY!

81
00:04:59,262 --> 00:05:02,632
SO, LIBERTY. HOW DO YOU LIKE BEING TEAM MANAGER?

82
00:05:02,666 --> 00:05:04,601
GREAT. I LOVE IT.

83
00:05:06,636 --> 00:05:08,805
HOW COME THE GIRLS GET TO WEAR THESE RATTY THINGS

84
00:05:08,839 --> 00:05:10,407
AND THE BOYS GET UNIFORMS?

85
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:13,710
THAT'S BECAUSE WE DIDN'T BUDGET FOR A GIRLS FLOOR HOCKEY TEAM.

86
00:05:13,743 --> 00:05:16,112
WE DIDN'T THINK THERE'D BE SO MUCH INTEREST.

87
00:05:16,146 --> 00:05:18,114
YOU DO KNOW BOYS TEAMS GET EIGHTY PERCENT

88
00:05:18,148 --> 00:05:19,816
OF THE ATHLETICS BUDGET?

89
00:05:19,850 --> 00:05:22,752
THAT'S BECAUSE THERE'S MORE BOYS TEAMS.

90
00:05:22,786 --> 00:05:24,721
MONEY'S TIGHT FOR ALL TEAMS THESE DAYS.

91
00:05:24,754 --> 00:05:26,256
THERE MUST BE A WAY AROUND IT.

92
00:05:26,289 --> 00:05:29,759
WHAT ABOUT FUND-RAISERS? OR SPONSORSHIPS?

93
00:05:29,793 --> 00:05:31,828
SURE. THAT TAKES A LOT OF WORK.

94
00:05:31,862 --> 00:05:34,664
MR. ARMSTRONG - WORK'S MY FORTE.

95
00:05:34,698 --> 00:05:37,534
AND I KNOW EXACTLY WHERE TO START.

96
00:05:41,972 --> 00:05:43,273
PLUS, YOU CAN WRITE THE SPONSORSHIP OFF

97
00:05:43,306 --> 00:05:44,341
AS A TAX CREDIT.

98
00:05:44,374 --> 00:05:46,743
YES, I KNOW BUT THE BOYS HAVE ALREADY ASKED ME-

99
00:05:46,776 --> 00:05:48,745
TO SPONSOR THEIR BASKETBALL TEAM.

100
00:05:48,778 --> 00:05:51,348
THEY DON'T NEED YOUR HELP, MR. JEREMIAH, WE DO.

101
00:05:51,381 --> 00:05:53,884
BUT THE PANTHERS HAVE DONE AWESOME ALL YEAR.

102
00:05:53,917 --> 00:05:57,854
YES. AND WE CAN TOO - IF WE GET THE SAME FULL SUPPORT.

103
00:05:57,888 --> 00:05:59,923
LOOK, SAY YOUR DAUGHTER WAS ON OUR TEAM.

104
00:05:59,956 --> 00:06:03,860
WOULD YOU WANT HER WEARING THIS? I MEAN, LOOK.

105
00:06:03,894 --> 00:06:06,229
WE NEED THIS, MR. JEREMIAH.

106
00:06:06,263 --> 00:06:09,933
OKAY, LOOK - I CAN'T SPONSOR BOTH TEAMS.

107
00:06:09,966 --> 00:06:12,569
BUT I'LL THINK ABOUT IT OKAY?

108
00:06:17,908 --> 00:06:19,376
OUR NEW JERSEY DESIGN.

109
00:06:19,409 --> 00:06:20,810
WOW. THAT'S AWESOME, LIBERTY.

110
00:06:20,844 --> 00:06:21,845
YEAH.

111
00:06:21,878 --> 00:06:23,280
THAT'S REALLY GOOD.

112
00:06:23,313 --> 00:06:25,815
THANKS. WE DO HAVE TO CONVINCE MR. JEREMIAH TO SPONSOR US

113
00:06:25,849 --> 00:06:28,818
AND NOT BOYS BASKETBALL - BUT, A MINOR DETAIL.

114
00:06:28,852 --> 00:06:31,888
YEAH, LIKE THE BOYS NEED FUNDING.

115
00:06:31,922 --> 00:06:34,391
I KNOW GIRLS, YOU'RE EXCITED ABOUT THIS,

116
00:06:34,424 --> 00:06:36,760
BUT EVEN WITH SPONSORSHIP WE'RE NOT GOING TO WIN ANYTHING

117
00:06:36,793 --> 00:06:38,261
UNLESS WE PRACTICE!

118
00:06:38,295 --> 00:06:39,896
OKAY, SO TAKE YOUR POSITIONS,

119
00:06:39,930 --> 00:06:42,999
WE'RE GOING TO DO PASSING DRILLS.

120
00:06:43,934 --> 00:06:45,969
OH, AND CAN YOU CLEAN THE PINNIES IN THE WASHING?

121
00:06:46,002 --> 00:06:48,038
I JUST WASHED THEM THE OTHER DAY.

122
00:06:48,071 --> 00:06:49,205
I KNOW, THEY'RE DIRTY AGAIN.

123
00:06:49,239 --> 00:06:52,609
OKAY GIRLS, C'MON CAN WE FOCUS PLEASE?

124
00:06:58,848 --> 00:07:00,250
HERE.

125
00:07:03,219 --> 00:07:07,657
"IN PALMISTRY, NO ONE INDICATOR BY ITSELF IS CONCLUSIVE."

126
00:07:07,691 --> 00:07:07,891
OKAY.

127
00:07:11,294 --> 00:07:13,330
WHICH HAND DID SHE READ?

128
00:07:13,363 --> 00:07:14,030
MY LEFT.

129
00:07:14,898 --> 00:07:16,700
AND YOU'RE RIGHT-HANDED.

130
00:07:16,733 --> 00:07:18,368
AND YOUR POINT IS?

131
00:07:18,401 --> 00:07:20,704
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO READ SOMEONE'S DOMINANT HAND.

132
00:07:20,737 --> 00:07:21,871
THE ONE YOU USE.

133
00:07:23,273 --> 00:07:25,809
HEY - I DO HAVE A LIFE-LINE.

134
00:07:26,843 --> 00:07:28,812
HERE, PAIGE.

135
00:07:28,845 --> 00:07:30,714
TO EXPRESS MY GRIEF.

136
00:07:31,348 --> 00:07:32,349
UM - THANKS.

137
00:07:34,417 --> 00:07:36,853
ANYTHING I CAN DO IN YOUR TIME OF NEED -

138
00:07:36,886 --> 00:07:38,822
LET ME KNOW - ANYTHING.

139
00:07:44,961 --> 00:07:46,963
SO, WHEN ARE YOU GOING TO TELL HER?

140
00:07:46,997 --> 00:07:50,967
ABOUT MY MIRACULOUS RECOVERY FROM THE BRINK OF DEATH?

141
00:07:51,001 --> 00:07:52,936
HMMM - I DON'T KNOW.

142
00:08:02,345 --> 00:08:04,280
LIBERTY, WE JUST WANTED TO SAY THAT WE REALLY APPRECIATE

143
00:08:04,314 --> 00:08:06,116
WHAT YOU TRIED TO DO.

144
00:08:06,149 --> 00:08:08,818
THANKS. BUT MS. H PUT ME IN MY RIGHTFUL PLACE.

145
00:08:08,852 --> 00:08:10,253
THE LAUNDRY ROOM.

146
00:08:10,854 --> 00:08:11,821
VAN ZANDT.

147
00:08:11,855 --> 00:08:13,957
WHAT'S UP WITH TRYING TO STEAL OUR SPONSORSHIP?

148
00:08:13,990 --> 00:08:16,826
YEAH, UH - WHO CARES ABOUT GIRLS' SPORTS?

149
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:19,262
EXCEPT OF COURSE MUD WRESTLING.

150
00:08:21,498 --> 00:08:22,599
LOOK, YOU GIRLS ARE CRAZY.

151
00:08:22,632 --> 00:08:26,936
JEREMIAH'S GONNA BACK US BECAUSE WE'RE A WINNING TEAM.

152
00:08:26,970 --> 00:08:28,872
YOU REALLY THINK YOU'RE BETTER THAN US?

153
00:08:28,905 --> 00:08:31,274
UH, WELCOME TO THE CONVERSATION. YEAH.

154
00:08:31,307 --> 00:08:34,978
THEN PROVE IT. FLOOR HOCKEY. GIRLS VERSUS BOYS.

155
00:08:35,011 --> 00:08:36,279
UH - LIBERTY...

156
00:08:36,913 --> 00:08:39,449
OKAY. SAY, UM - WINNER GETS THE SPONSORSHIP?

157
00:08:39,482 --> 00:08:43,019
AND LOSER DOES THE OTHER TEAM'S LAUNDRY FOR A WEEK.

158
00:08:43,053 --> 00:08:45,188
AWESOME. I SWEAT LIKE A PIG.

159
00:08:45,221 --> 00:08:48,825
YEAH, I GOTTA PAY FOR MY WASHING.

160
00:08:54,297 --> 00:08:57,333
SO, WHOSE IDEA WAS THIS AGAIN?

161
00:08:57,367 --> 00:08:59,536
WELL, I AM NOT COACHING YOU GUYS SO YOU CAN GET INTO

162
00:08:59,569 --> 00:09:02,372
A GRUDGE MATCH WITH THE BOYS OVER BRAGGING RIGHTS.

163
00:09:02,405 --> 00:09:05,008
IT'S NOT ABOUT BRAGGING RIGHTS. IT'S ABOUT A SPONSORSHIP.

164
00:09:05,041 --> 00:09:07,277
WELL, WHY GAMBLE FOR IT? LET MR. JEREMIAH DECIDE.

165
00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:11,314
HE CAN'T - SO WE HAVE TO DO THIS.

166
00:09:11,347 --> 00:09:13,983
LOOK. I KNOW THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT FOR YOU -

167
00:09:14,017 --> 00:09:15,085
BUT BETWEEN SCHOOL,

168
00:09:15,118 --> 00:09:18,154
AND PREPARING YOU GIRLS FOR THE ACTUAL COMPETITION -

169
00:09:18,188 --> 00:09:20,356
I CAN'T HELP YOU WITH THIS. I'M SORRY.

170
00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:22,158
BUT WE NEED A SUPERVISOR.

171
00:09:22,192 --> 00:09:24,394
YES, YES YOU DO.

172
00:09:26,196 --> 00:09:29,399
GREAT. NOW, WHO'S GONNA COACH US?

173
00:09:31,334 --> 00:09:33,970
I WILL. AND I'LL LEAD US TO VICTORY-

174
00:09:34,003 --> 00:09:37,273
LIKE NAPOLEON IN THE BATTLE OF LEIPZIG.

175
00:09:42,278 --> 00:09:44,280
"ONE HUNDRED DAYS TO GLORY"?

176
00:09:44,314 --> 00:09:45,415
OUR STRATEGY.

177
00:09:45,448 --> 00:09:50,386
IT OUTLINES WHAT WE HAVE TO DO TO WIN THE REGIONALS.

178
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:53,022
YOGA? MEDITATION?

179
00:09:53,356 --> 00:09:54,424
NO JUNK FOOD?

180
00:09:55,758 --> 00:09:58,328
TO ACHIEVE PERFECTION, ONE MUST ENVISION PERFECTION.

181
00:09:58,361 --> 00:10:02,065
ENVISION, ACHIEVE, WIN - A SIMPLE FORMULA.

182
00:10:08,238 --> 00:10:10,306
(COMPLAINING WALLA)

183
00:10:14,344 --> 00:10:18,348
OH MY GOSH I CAN'T- YOU'VE GOT TO BE KIDDING.

184
00:10:18,381 --> 00:10:19,849
NAPOLEON SAID IF YOU WANT AUTHORITY-

185
00:10:19,883 --> 00:10:23,153
YOU MUST DRESS THE PART. I LOOK REGAL. COMMANDING.

186
00:10:23,186 --> 00:10:24,487
STUPID...

187
00:10:28,291 --> 00:10:29,592
(whistle) SILENCE!

188
00:10:32,595 --> 00:10:36,299
(AHEM) LIBERTY? I CAN'T PRACTICE TODAY.

189
00:10:36,332 --> 00:10:38,168
I SORTA, HAVE MY PERIOD.

190
00:10:38,201 --> 00:10:39,435
MANNY.

191
00:10:39,469 --> 00:10:41,337
A TRUE CHAMPION DOESN'T LET A SILLY LITTLE 'MONTHLY VISITOR'

192
00:10:41,371 --> 00:10:44,073
STAND BETWEEN HER AND VICTORY.

193
00:10:55,318 --> 00:10:57,954
NOW. LET'S GET STARTED. (whistle)

194
00:10:57,987 --> 00:10:59,389
FALL IN! POSITIONS!

195
00:11:06,930 --> 00:11:08,631
AND THEN I REALIZED, I'LL NEVER HAVE A DRIVER'S LICENSE

196
00:11:08,665 --> 00:11:13,469
OR A SENIOR PROM. TER, I'M TOO YOUNG TO DIE.(SOB)

197
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:19,676
DON'T CRY. CAN I GET YOU ANYTHING?

198
00:11:19,709 --> 00:11:24,547
SURE. AND MAYBE YOU COULD EVEN DO MY BOOK REPORT FOR KWAN?

199
00:11:26,349 --> 00:11:28,918
WITH ALL THIS STRESS YOU BROUGHT ME -

200
00:11:28,952 --> 00:11:31,454
HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO CONCENTRATE?

201
00:11:31,487 --> 00:11:33,489
YOU'RE RIGHT. I'M THERE.

202
00:11:41,497 --> 00:11:43,600
YOU STAY IN THE LEFT-WING - ALLOWING THE FORECHECKERS

203
00:11:43,633 --> 00:11:46,135
TO GO DEEP IN THE OFFENSIVE ZONE.

204
00:11:46,169 --> 00:11:48,204
WHAT'S THIS PLAY CALLED AGAIN?

205
00:11:48,238 --> 00:11:49,639
THE LEFT-WING LOCK.

206
00:11:51,541 --> 00:11:54,477
IT LIMITS BREAKOUT SPACE AND FORCES THE OPPOSITION'S DEFENSE

207
00:11:54,510 --> 00:11:56,679
TO CARRY THE PUCK OR BANK IT UP IN THE BOARDS.

208
00:11:56,713 --> 00:11:59,249
GIRLS, THIS IS CHILD'S PLAY!

209
00:12:00,049 --> 00:12:01,217
HEY LITTLE MISS HAPPY FACE.

210
00:12:01,251 --> 00:12:03,019
WHAT'S A NEUTRAL ZONE TRAP, HUH?

211
00:12:03,052 --> 00:12:03,920
I DON'T KNOW.

212
00:12:04,454 --> 00:12:06,322
PAGE SIXTEEN. DID YOU READ IT?!

213
00:12:06,356 --> 00:12:07,624
MAYBE YOU DON'T KNOW HOW TO READ?

214
00:12:07,657 --> 00:12:09,225
WHY ARE YOU PICKING ON ME?

215
00:12:09,259 --> 00:12:11,728
BECAUSE YOU'RE THE WEAKEST LINK!

216
00:12:15,598 --> 00:12:16,599
ATTENTION STUDENTS.

217
00:12:16,633 --> 00:12:19,002
A FRIENDLY REQUEST FROM OUR CUSTODIAL STAFF

218
00:12:19,035 --> 00:12:21,704
THAT YOU USE THE GARBAGE CANS PROVIDED IN ALL CORRIDORS--

219
00:12:21,738 --> 00:12:23,273
DON'T TEST ME KENDRA.

220
00:12:23,306 --> 00:12:25,008
WHY NOT? NAPOLEON.

221
00:12:26,109 --> 00:12:28,111
IF WE WANT TO WIN, YOU PLAYERS NEED TO PULL TOGETHER.

222
00:12:28,144 --> 00:12:29,312
WE'RE NOT GOING TO WIN, LIBERTY.

223
00:12:29,345 --> 00:12:31,447
NOT WITH YOU BARKING ORDERS.

224
00:12:31,481 --> 00:12:33,383
THEY'RE NOT ORDERS, THEY'RE PLAYS.

225
00:12:33,416 --> 00:12:34,651
WE DON'T UNDERSTAND THEM.

226
00:12:34,684 --> 00:12:38,388
THEY'RE USELESS. KINDA LIKE YOU, AS COACH.

227
00:12:45,695 --> 00:12:46,162
EW!

228
00:12:58,474 --> 00:13:00,410
FINISHED.

229
00:13:02,345 --> 00:13:03,413
TER? YOUR HEAD!

230
00:13:05,081 --> 00:13:07,550
OH. I GET ZITS WHEN I'M STRESSED.

231
00:13:07,583 --> 00:13:09,719
I JUST EMAILED YOUR REPORT.

232
00:13:09,752 --> 00:13:12,121
I DIDN'T GET MINE DONE, BUT THAT'S OKAY.

233
00:13:12,155 --> 00:13:13,656
I ONLY LOSE TEN PERCENT.

234
00:13:13,690 --> 00:13:14,757
ARE YOU SURE?

235
00:13:16,726 --> 00:13:17,660
UM, THANKS.

236
00:13:22,165 --> 00:13:25,168
WHO SAID DYING WASN'T ANY FUN?

237
00:13:29,305 --> 00:13:32,275
ATTENTION STAFF AND VISITORS, THERE IS A DARK GREEN MINIVAN

238
00:13:32,308 --> 00:13:34,043
PARKED OUTSIDE THE AUTOSHOP.

239
00:13:34,077 --> 00:13:35,345
WOULD THE OWNER PLEASE REMOVE IT IMMEDIATELY.

240
00:13:35,378 --> 00:13:37,513
HEY TERRI - WHAT'S UP?

241
00:13:38,414 --> 00:13:41,451
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHEN I CAN GET SOME SLEEP.

242
00:13:41,484 --> 00:13:45,154
BEING TERRI AND PAIGE IS HARD WORK.

243
00:13:45,188 --> 00:13:46,656
CAN I TALK TO YOU ABOUT THAT?

244
00:13:46,689 --> 00:13:47,490
WHAT?

245
00:13:47,523 --> 00:13:49,392
WELL, LET'S JUST SAY - WHEN I TELL YOU?

246
00:13:49,425 --> 00:13:50,626
YOU'RE GONNA WANNA KILL SOMEONE

247
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:54,030
WHO'S TECHNICALLY ALREADY DYING.

248
00:14:05,308 --> 00:14:06,576
SOME GIRLS TEAM, EH?

249
00:14:06,609 --> 00:14:10,346
WHAT ARE THEY DOING, PUTTING ON THEIR MAKEUP?

250
00:14:21,758 --> 00:14:24,127
CLOSED SET! EVERYBODY OUT!

251
00:14:25,461 --> 00:14:28,364
UM, IT'S JUST A HOCKEY GAME, LIBERTY.

252
00:14:28,398 --> 00:14:30,199
NO SPINNER. IT'S YOUR FUNERAL.

253
00:14:30,233 --> 00:14:31,367
LAST TIME - OUT!

254
00:14:37,206 --> 00:14:38,341
YOU.

255
00:14:38,374 --> 00:14:39,842
PANTHER. SCOREBOARD.

256
00:14:42,278 --> 00:14:43,279
AY, CAPTAIN.

257
00:14:48,384 --> 00:14:50,453
OKAY GIRLS, REMEMBER WHAT NAPOLEON SAID:

258
00:14:50,486 --> 00:14:52,355
"ONE MUST KNOW WHEN TO LEAVE THE SKIN OF THE LION

259
00:14:52,388 --> 00:14:54,357
TO TAKE THE SKIN OF A FOX."

260
00:15:00,329 --> 00:15:04,267
SO, GET OUT THERE AND GIVE IT TO THEM, RIGHT?

261
00:15:05,368 --> 00:15:06,869
RIGHT!

262
00:15:08,504 --> 00:15:09,439
(whistle)

263
00:15:17,513 --> 00:15:20,349
YOU READY? READY? LET'S GO!

264
00:15:43,973 --> 00:15:45,475
WE SHOULD TOTALLY GO TO THAT MOVIE TONIGHT,

265
00:15:45,508 --> 00:15:48,244
SEEING AS HOW YOUR HOMEWORK'S ALREADY DONE.

266
00:15:48,277 --> 00:15:51,681
MAYBE WE CAN EVEN GET TERRI TO PAY?

267
00:15:54,217 --> 00:15:56,285
ASHLEY? ON A OUIJA BOARD.

268
00:15:58,654 --> 00:16:01,424
TERRI TOLD ME THE SAD NEWS.

269
00:16:01,457 --> 00:16:03,860
I THOUGHT THAT WE SHOULD GET A SECOND OPINION.

270
00:16:03,893 --> 00:16:04,994
HEY TERRI,

271
00:16:05,027 --> 00:16:07,330
WOULDN'T IT WORK BETTER IF PAIGE WAS SITTING HERE?

272
00:16:07,363 --> 00:16:08,531
YES, IT WOULD.

273
00:16:12,268 --> 00:16:13,369
DO I HAVE TO DO ANYTHING?

274
00:16:13,402 --> 00:16:16,272
NO. JUST WATCH AND READ.

275
00:16:17,673 --> 00:16:19,842
MYSTIC ORACLE, IS IT TRUE?

276
00:16:23,646 --> 00:16:24,714
IS WHAT TRUE?

277
00:16:26,516 --> 00:16:30,853
THAT YOU - AND HAZEL - PLAYED ME FOR A FOOL?

278
00:16:32,822 --> 00:16:35,224
WOW, I REALLY BETTER GET GOING.

279
00:16:39,295 --> 00:16:40,863
YOU'RE DEAD, MICHALCHUK!

280
00:16:40,897 --> 00:16:44,367
I'M GONNA GET YOU, GET BACK HERE.

281
00:16:47,470 --> 00:16:51,774
AROUND THE OFFENSE A PERIMETER CREATE!

282
00:16:52,475 --> 00:16:53,976
MANNY - TAKE IT IN. TAKE IT IN!

283
00:16:54,010 --> 00:16:54,710
I CAN'T!

284
00:16:54,744 --> 00:16:56,279
TAKE IT IN! NOW!

285
00:16:56,312 --> 00:16:58,614
WHOA! HOLD ON GUYS. (whistle)

286
00:16:58,648 --> 00:17:01,984
YOU OKAY? HELP ME GET HER UP GUYS. GET HER UP, GET HER UP.

287
00:17:02,018 --> 00:17:03,486
OW.

288
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:05,588
SLOWLY. WHERE DOES IT HURT?

289
00:17:06,389 --> 00:17:08,324
ARE YOU OKAY?

290
00:17:08,724 --> 00:17:11,661
IT'S MY WRIST. I LANDED ON IT.

291
00:17:11,694 --> 00:17:13,696
SHE'S FINE. YOU'RE FINE, RIGHT?

292
00:17:13,729 --> 00:17:14,597
I DON'T WANT TO TAKE ANY CHANCES.

293
00:17:14,630 --> 00:17:15,765
MANNY GO SEE THE NURSE.

294
00:17:15,798 --> 00:17:18,434
NO, SHE'S GOING BACK OUT ON THE FLOOR, WHERE WE NEED HER.

295
00:17:18,467 --> 00:17:20,336
I'M THE REF AND I'M TELLING HER TO GO SEE THE NURSE.

296
00:17:20,369 --> 00:17:21,470
AFTER THIS PERIOD.

297
00:17:21,504 --> 00:17:22,605
GET SOMEONE ELSE TO PLAY.

298
00:17:22,638 --> 00:17:25,608
THOSE GIRLS? THEY'RE ALTERNATES FOR A REASON, JOEY. NO.

299
00:17:25,641 --> 00:17:26,909
YOU'RE BEING A TYRANT.

300
00:17:26,943 --> 00:17:28,544
I'M DOING MY JOB!

301
00:17:28,578 --> 00:17:31,547
LIBERTY. MAYBE YOU NEED TO RELAX?

302
00:17:31,581 --> 00:17:34,050
AND MAYBE YOU NEED TO SHUT UP, AND DO WHAT I TELL YOU.

303
00:17:34,083 --> 00:17:35,017
ALL OF YOU.

304
00:17:37,987 --> 00:17:42,458
GOOD LUCK TRYING TO WIN SHORT TWO PLAYERS, LIBERTY.

305
00:17:43,926 --> 00:17:48,864
SOMEONE MAKE SURE MANNY GOES TO THE NURSE'S OFFICE, PLEASE.

306
00:17:53,536 --> 00:17:56,472
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU GIRLS. I THOUGHT YOU WANTED TO WIN.

307
00:17:56,505 --> 00:17:57,473
NOT LIKE THIS.

308
00:18:00,810 --> 00:18:02,545
YEAH. WOO-HOO!

309
00:18:04,547 --> 00:18:06,649
HEY - GAMES NOT OVER, GUYS.

310
00:18:06,682 --> 00:18:09,485
THEY CAN STILL COME OUT AND FINISH IT.

311
00:18:09,518 --> 00:18:12,388
...I CANNOT BELIEVE... IT'S ALL HER FAULT! I KNOW!

312
00:18:12,421 --> 00:18:14,824
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU'RE ALL QUITTING! THIS IS A TEAM!

313
00:18:14,857 --> 00:18:20,463
WE'RE NOT QUITTING THE TEAM, LIBERTY. WE'RE QUITTING YOU.

314
00:18:20,496 --> 00:18:22,064
THAT'S SO UNFAIR.

315
00:18:22,098 --> 00:18:25,334
COACHES ARE SUPPOSED TO INSPIRE PEOPLE. YOU JUST BARK AT US.

316
00:18:25,368 --> 00:18:26,736
AND GIVE US CRAZY TEXTBOOKS.

317
00:18:26,769 --> 00:18:29,372
'A THOUSAND WAYS TO MAKE US MISERABLE.'

318
00:18:29,405 --> 00:18:30,139
AND THE STUPID CAPE?

319
00:18:30,172 --> 00:18:31,107
PLUS THAT WHOLE THING WITH MANNY -

320
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:33,409
ALRIGHT, I GET THE POINT!

321
00:18:34,443 --> 00:18:36,512
LOOK, YOU'RE A GREAT TEAM.

322
00:18:36,545 --> 00:18:40,016
BE MAD AT ME - BUT DON'T LET THOSE GUYS WIN.

323
00:18:40,049 --> 00:18:42,518
KENDRA? YOUR SLAPSHOT IS DEAD-ON.

324
00:18:42,551 --> 00:18:44,754
EMMA? YOU'RE A GOOD OFFENSIVE CAPTAIN.

325
00:18:44,787 --> 00:18:46,489
FOCUS ON GETTING KENDRA TO THE NET.

326
00:18:46,522 --> 00:18:50,326
LET HER DO THE SCORING. AND IT'S YOUR GAME.

327
00:18:52,995 --> 00:18:54,730
SHE DOES HAVE A POINT.

328
00:18:54,764 --> 00:18:58,000
WE CAN'T LET THOSE JERKS GET THE JERSEYS.

329
00:18:58,034 --> 00:18:59,702
LET'S GET 'EM.

330
00:19:01,437 --> 00:19:04,440
LIBERTY, WE'VE GOT IT COVERED, OKAY?

331
00:19:05,508 --> 00:19:07,576
RIGHT. WELL - GO GET 'EM.

332
00:19:16,552 --> 00:19:18,487
I'M THE WEAKEST LINK.

333
00:19:29,031 --> 00:19:30,099
HEY, LIBERTY.

334
00:19:33,536 --> 00:19:36,939
THE GAME'S STILL GOING ON. WHAT'RE YOU DOING OUT HERE?

335
00:19:36,972 --> 00:19:39,475
I RUINED EVERYTHING, MS. H.

336
00:19:39,508 --> 00:19:41,644
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

337
00:19:41,677 --> 00:19:43,512
THE GIRLS ALL HATE ME.

338
00:19:52,488 --> 00:19:55,024
DID YOU PUSH THEM TOO HARD?

339
00:19:55,057 --> 00:19:58,194
I REALLY WANTED THEM TO WIN THOSE JERSEYS.

340
00:19:58,227 --> 00:20:00,096
IT'S A WORTHY CAUSE.

341
00:20:00,796 --> 00:20:04,867
YEAH, BUT I THINK I SQUISHED OUT ALL THE FUN OF PLAYING.

342
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:07,570
YOU KNOW, LIBERTY, IT'S TOUGH FOR ANY COACH -

343
00:20:07,603 --> 00:20:10,673
BALANCING WINNING WITH HAVING SOME FUN.

344
00:20:11,574 --> 00:20:14,176
YEAH, AND IT'S SO NOT WORTH IT.

345
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:39,201
HAVING FUN?

346
00:20:39,235 --> 00:20:40,903
YEAH, SO MUCH.

347
00:20:41,604 --> 00:20:43,072
SORRY, WE DIDN'T WIN.

348
00:20:43,105 --> 00:20:47,076
YOU ALMOST WON. LOSING BY ONE POINT SUCKS, BUT IMPRESSIVE.

349
00:20:47,109 --> 00:20:47,710
THANKS.

350
00:20:48,911 --> 00:20:52,214
NOT IMPRESSIVE ENOUGH TO GET JOEY'S UNIFORMS, OF COURSE.

351
00:20:52,248 --> 00:20:54,850
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT. GIRLS!

352
00:20:59,155 --> 00:21:01,557
MR. JEREMIAH SAID HE HADN'T SEEN SUCH A GREAT BATTLE OF THE SEXES
