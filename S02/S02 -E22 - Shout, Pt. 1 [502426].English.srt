IT AIN'T NEVER GONNA HAPPEN.

20
00:01:46,238 --> 00:01:48,640
AIN'T NEVER? THAT'S A DOUBLE NEGATIVE.

21
00:01:48,673 --> 00:01:50,575
YOU ARE A DOUBLE NEGATIVE.

22
00:01:50,609 --> 00:01:52,911
AND YOU'RE RAINING ON MY LOVE PARADE.

23
00:01:52,944 --> 00:01:54,713

00:01:59,217 --> 00:02:01,052
SO,YOU SAW ME WIN THE GAME?

SO. TOMORROW NIGHT.

30
00:02:03,889 --> 00:02:07,626
UH, YOU WANNA HANG OUT WITH DEGRASSI'S NEW MVP?

31

MAYBE A MOVIE?

32
00:02:10,862 --> 00:02:16,034
SATURDAY. RIGHT. I WAS GOING TO WORK ON MY M.I. PROJECT.

33
00:02:16,067 --> 00:02:18,570
OH. COULDN'T YOU CAN'T DO THAT SUNDAY?

34
00:02:18,603 --> 00:02:21,139

WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

41
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:36,521
WE'VE DONE STUFF TOGETHER BEFORE.

42
00:02:36,555 --> 00:02:39,057
NOT LIKE THIS. SPINNER? CHICK FLICKS?

43
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:40,158

00:02:40,192 --> 00:02:43,128
ANYWAY, I AM LOOKING TO DATE UP THIS YEAR, REMEMBER?

45
00:02:43,161 --> 00:02:45,797
I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU SAY, SPINNER'S GOT A CRUSH.

46
00:02:45,831 --> 00:02:48,834
HON, SPINNER AND I ARE JUST FRIENDS.

47
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:52,671
I KNEW YOU WERE MORE THAN FRIENDS!

48
00:02:52,704 --> 00:02:57,142
I AM A WINNER ON THE FIELD AND WITH THE LADIES.

49
00:02:57,175 --> 00:03:00,545
I COULDN'T HAVE PICKED A BETTER DAY TO ASK HER OUT.

50
00:03:00,579 --> 00:03:02,080
PAIGE IS THE COOLEST GIRL IN GRADE NINE.

51
00:03:02,113 --> 00:03:04,216
YOU ARE AWARE OF THAT.

52
00:03:04,249 --> 00:03:05,050
OF COURSE.

53
00:03:05,083 --> 00:03:06,885
YOU'RE THE MAN THESE DAYS -

00:03:06,918 --> 00:03:09,888
BUT THE STAKES ARE STILL HIGH. PLANS?

55
00:03:09,921 --> 00:03:11,189
I'M GOING WITH THE MOVIE OPTION.

56
00:03:11,223 --> 00:03:13,291
CLASSIC, BUT CASUAL.

00:03:22,901 --> 00:03:27,706
YOU CAN'T MAKE HER DRINK. BUT YOU CAN MAKE HER THIRSTY.

00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:33,745
HE'S HANDSOME, HE'S MATURE -

00:03:33,778 --> 00:03:35,180
AND HE'S TOTALLY LEAVING!

64
00:03:35,213 --> 00:03:36,982
PAIGE, YOUR LIFE IS CALLING.

00:04:44,983 --> 00:04:45,784
FASCINATING.

84
00:04:46,818 --> 00:04:49,821
OH, MY CLOWN WIG! THE POSSIBILITIES!

85
00:04:56,061 --> 00:04:57,862
OH! HUMANE SOCIETY!

86
00:04:58,163 --> 00:05:02,968
WE'RE NOT ANIMALS - WE'RE HUMAN BEINGS. AND THIS IS DISGUSTING!

87
00:05:03,001 --> 00:05:04,936
IT'S A MAN-CAVE!

88
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:07,806
I, I, I, IT'S A TOXIC DUMP.

89
00:05:07,839 --> 00:05:10,909
I CAN'T BELIEVE I VOLUNTEERED TO BE YOUR LOCKER MATE.

90
00:05:10,942 --> 00:05:13,912
SHARE A LOCKER, DO SOMETHING FOR DEGRASSI,

91
00:05:13,945 --> 00:05:15,313
RADITCH, OUR FRIEND.

92
00:05:15,347 --> 00:05:20,352
IF YOU WANT US TO STAY FRIENDS, YOU'LL CLEAN THIS UP.

93
00:05:27,359 --> 00:05:28,927
THEY'RE, LIKE, SIX FEET OFF THE GROUND.

94
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:29,995
FORGET IT.

95
00:05:30,028 --> 00:05:31,963

00:05:36,001 --> 00:05:37,302
IT'S SPINNER.

98
00:05:40,038 --> 00:05:41,840
YOU HAVE TO CANCEL.

99
00:05:44,009 --> 00:05:47,946

00:05:51,483 --> 00:05:52,851

DUDE, IT'S A DATE. NOT A MARATHON, OKAY.

106
00:06:12,937 --> 00:06:16,775
OKAY, I JUST NEED SOME CHOICES.

EVER SINCE YOU SCORED THE WINNING GOAL, I -"

112
00:06:33,825 --> 00:06:35,894
HEY DUDE, IT'S NOT FUNNY.

113
00:06:37,362 --> 00:06:39,864
HER GRANDMOTHER'S IN THE HOSPITAL.

114
00:06:39,898 --> 00:06:41,032
SHE'S CANCELING.

115
00:06:42,967 --> 00:06:43,902
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT, PARTNER.

00:07:19,971 --> 00:07:22,574
REALLY? YOU DID, HUH?

124
00:07:22,607 --> 00:07:24,909
EDUARDO! WHERE YOU BEEN, MAN?

125
00:07:24,943 --> 00:07:26,244
WE'RE TOTALLY OVER-DRESSED.

126
00:07:26,277 --> 00:07:29,013
WE DO STAND OUT BUT THAT'S GOOD.

127
00:07:29,914 --> 00:07:34,519
ALL WE NEED IS THE ATTITUDE TO BACK IT UP. WATCH THIS -

128
00:07:35,153 --> 00:07:38,223
HE'S INTENSE. THAT ELECTROSLASH STUFF HE DOES WITH LUCKY...

129
00:07:38,256 --> 00:07:40,158
AND W-ZONE IS A COMPLETE GENIUS.

130
00:07:40,191 --> 00:07:42,427
OH. YEAH. HE'S TOTALLY GREAT.

DEAN ARE YOU A BIG TECHNO FAN?

133
00:07:53,538 --> 00:07:55,173
I'D LOVE TO KNOW WHAT YOU THINK.

134
00:07:55,206 --> 00:07:57,909

135
00:07:57,942 --> 00:08:00,345

136
00:08:03,882 --> 00:08:06,084
HEY. YOU MIGHT WANNA JUST CHILL.

137
00:08:06,117 --> 00:08:06,951
EXCUSE ME?

138
00:08:07,752 --> 00:08:10,622
JUST - HE'S A LITTLE OLD FOR YOU.

139
00:08:10,655 --> 00:08:13,191
AND YOU'RE A LITTLE JEALOUS.

140
00:08:17,362 --> 00:08:19,898
HEY SPIRIT. EVERYTHING COOL?

141
00:08:21,466 --> 00:08:23,001
PERFECT.

142
00:08:29,941 --> 00:08:32,076
IT'S ALL ABOUT THE RIGHT COMBINATION OF TASTES.

143
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:35,513
I HAVE YET TO DISCOVER THE PERFECT MATCH.

144
00:08:36,214 --> 00:08:39,017
MARSHMALLOWS? IN KD?

145
00:08:39,050 --> 00:08:40,919
JUST LIVING LIFE ON THE EDGE.

146
00:08:40,952 --> 00:08:43,288
SO, I'VE BEEN PROCESSING WHAT YOU SAID YESTERDAY

147
00:08:43,321 --> 00:08:46,958
AND I'VE DECIDED TO DO MY VERY BEST TO RESPECT YOUR NEEDS

148
00:08:46,991 --> 00:08:49,127
WHEN IT COMES TO OUR LOCKER.

149
00:08:51,963 --> 00:08:54,299
CHEESE-FLAVOURED CORN SNACK?

150
00:08:56,067 --> 00:08:58,403
NO? AND WHILE SOME WOULD SAY

151
00:08:59,270 --> 00:09:04,075
THAT CLEAN FREAKS LIKE YOURSELF ARE TOTALLY ANNOYING,

152
00:09:04,108 --> 00:09:07,912
YOU'RE MY FRIEND AND I PLAN TO KEEP IT THAT WAY.

153
00:09:11,983 --> 00:09:13,585
NOW, UM, WANT SOME.

154
00:09:17,689 --> 00:09:19,524
YOUR WHOLE SQUAD WAS REALLY GREAT -

155
00:09:19,557 --> 00:09:21,492
BUT YOU TOTALLY STOOD OUT.

156
00:09:21,526 --> 00:09:22,894
I DID?

157
00:09:24,295 --> 00:09:26,364
WHAT'RE YOU LOOKING AT?

158
00:09:26,397 --> 00:09:29,234
YOUR EYES. ARE THEY GREEN OR BLUE?

159
00:09:29,734 --> 00:09:31,936
IT DEPENDS ON THE LIGHT.

160
00:09:32,737 --> 00:09:36,975
THE MOST AMAZING COLOURED EYES I'VE EVER SEEN.

161
00:09:37,642 --> 00:09:39,577
THEY'RE VERY BEAUTIFUL.

162
00:09:53,691 --> 00:09:54,692
YES?

163
00:10:03,134 --> 00:10:04,969
LET'S JUST GO, OKAY?

164
00:10:05,003 --> 00:10:06,938

00:10:10,675 --> 00:10:13,344
DEAN, UM, IT'S SO LOUD OUT HERE...

166
00:10:14,512 --> 00:10:18,449
WANNA MAYBE GO SOMEPLACE A LITTLE MORE PRIVATE?

168
00:10:26,124 --> 00:10:28,059
YOU ARE SO CUTE.

169
00:10:32,030 --> 00:10:35,233
I THINK MY FRIEND'S ROOM SHOULD BE QUIET.

170
00:10:46,244 --> 00:10:47,645
I KINDA LIKE IT DARK.

171
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:50,348
BUT I CAN'T SEE ANYTHING - OW...

172
00:10:50,381 --> 00:10:55,653
THERE'S THE BED. THERE'S THE DOOR. AND HERE'S THE PARTY.

173
00:10:56,421 --> 00:10:58,122
WHY ARE WE WHISPERING?

174
00:10:58,156 --> 00:11:00,358
BECAUSE MY FRIENDS ARE NEANDERTHALS.

175
00:11:00,391 --> 00:11:03,995
WE DON'T WANT THEM TO HEAR US, RIGHT? OKAY?

176
00:11:04,662 --> 00:11:05,730
OKAY.

177
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,276
YOU ARE SO ADORABLE.

178
00:11:18,309 --> 00:11:19,677
I AM?

179
00:11:19,711 --> 00:11:21,779
OH, YEAH. COME HERE.

180
00:11:24,816 --> 00:11:26,084
IS THIS OKAY?

181
00:11:26,751 --> 00:11:28,152
NO... YEAH.

182
00:11:34,292 --> 00:11:36,294
JUST TAKE IT SLOW. OKAY?

183
00:11:38,363 --> 00:11:39,764
DEAN I SAID SLOW?

184
00:11:51,776 --> 00:11:54,812
WHAT ARE YOU DOING? I DON'T THINK SO.

185
00:11:54,846 --> 00:11:55,780
DEAN. NO.

186
00:11:57,115 --> 00:11:57,782
IT'S OKAY.

187
00:11:57,815 --> 00:11:59,817
DEAN STOP, GET OFF.

188
00:11:59,851 --> 00:12:01,686
IT'S ALL GOOD.

189
00:12:01,719 --> 00:12:03,221
I SAID NO.

190
00:12:04,155 --> 00:12:05,757
STOP. PLEASE.

191
00:12:07,525 --> 00:12:10,795
DEAN GET OFF ME! STOP PLEASE. NO!

192
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,441
YOU ARE SO ADORABLE.

193
00:12:23,474 --> 00:12:25,176
I AM?

194
00:12:25,209 --> 00:12:26,744
OH YEAH.

195
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:38,289
HAZEL, GIVE ME A HEART ATTACK WHY DON'T YOU?

196
00:12:38,322 --> 00:12:40,291
IT WAS A JOKE. WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?

197
00:12:40,324 --> 00:12:42,293
NOTHING. I'M FINE.

198
00:12:42,894 --> 00:12:47,832
OK, WHAT'S THE BIG NEWS? DOES IT HAVE TO DO WITH DEAN?

199
00:12:47,865 --> 00:12:48,466
MAYBE.

200
00:12:48,499 --> 00:12:50,701
MAYBE? THEY WENT UPSTAIRS!

201
00:12:50,735 --> 00:12:52,470
UPSTAIRS? LIKE ALONE?

202
00:12:53,838 --> 00:12:55,573
UH, WHAT DO YOU THINK TER?

203
00:12:55,606 --> 00:12:56,707
SO YOU DID?

204
00:12:56,741 --> 00:12:57,809
YEAH. WE DID!

205
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:04,482
OKAY. THE "THEN AND NOW" PROJECT.

206
00:13:04,515 --> 00:13:07,552
NOW PLEASE TELL ME YOU REMEMBER ME ASSIGNING THIS LAST WEEK.

207
00:13:07,585 --> 00:13:09,687
TODAY, WE'RE GOING TO LOOK AT FIRST DRAFTS, TEXT ONLY.

208
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:13,558
THEN NEXT WEEK, WE'LL LAY IN OUR WEB GRAPHICS...

209
00:13:15,326 --> 00:13:17,495
IT'S A, PRETTY SUCCINCT ESSAY, PAIGE.

210
00:13:17,528 --> 00:13:21,599
YOU KNOW TEXT SOMETIMES INVOLVES THE ODD WORD.

211
00:13:21,632 --> 00:13:24,635
I, UH... WORKED ALL WEEKEND.

212
00:13:25,436 --> 00:13:26,838
BUT, SINCE I'M SUCH A DORK -

213
00:13:26,871 --> 00:13:29,807
I FORGOT TO EMAIL IT TO MY SCHOOL ACCOUNT.

214
00:13:29,841 --> 00:13:30,441
UM HMM.

215
00:13:31,776 --> 00:13:32,910
IT WAS SO FASCINATING.

216
00:13:32,944 --> 00:13:34,612
DID YOU KNOW PHARAOH PRINCESSES

217
00:13:34,645 --> 00:13:36,848
MADE LIPSTICK OUT OF IRON OXIDE?

218
00:13:36,881 --> 00:13:38,249
MMM? SOUNDS TOXIC.

219
00:13:38,282 --> 00:13:40,251
LEAD EYELINER - HELLO.

220
00:13:40,284 --> 00:13:43,888
NO WONDER THEY'RE ALL DEAD. TOMORROW, OKAY?

221
00:13:46,891 --> 00:13:48,559
SOMEONE'S IN LOVE.

222
00:13:48,593 --> 00:13:51,596
PLEASE. I'M NOT IN LOVE... DEAN'S NOT.

223
00:13:52,730 --> 00:13:53,698
HE HASN'T CALLED.

224
00:13:53,731 --> 00:13:54,966
SO? HE WILL.

225
00:13:54,999 --> 00:13:56,801
HE WOULD HAVE BY NOW.

226
00:13:56,834 --> 00:13:58,503
GIRL, GIVE HIM TIME.

227
00:13:58,970 --> 00:14:03,841
HAZEL. YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND, HE DIDN'T JUST KISS ME... WE...

228
00:14:07,245 --> 00:14:09,780
WHAT? PAIGE. YOU DIDN'T. YOU DID!

229
00:14:12,917 --> 00:14:14,852
YOU DID IT WITH DEAN?

230
00:14:14,886 --> 00:14:18,823
PAIGE, HAZEL? YOUR ASSIGNMENTS.

231
00:14:27,798 --> 00:14:29,367
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

232
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:31,736
OH UH, YOU SNOOZE, YOU LOSE.

233
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:35,640
WHAT DOES THIS SAY TO YOU?

234
00:14:36,307 --> 00:14:37,775
SEVERE MENTAL ILLNESS?

235
00:14:37,808 --> 00:14:41,579
IT SAYS BOUNDARIES, JT. BOUNDARIES.

236
00:14:41,612 --> 00:14:43,748
WHY DO YOU GET TO DECIDE WHAT MY BOUNDARIES ARE?

237
00:14:43,781 --> 00:14:45,783
BECAUSE YOU HAVE NONE!

238
00:14:45,816 --> 00:14:47,418
MY SIDE, YOUR SIDE.

239
00:14:47,852 --> 00:14:50,855
FROM NOW ON, YOU WILL FOLLOW MY RULE.

240
00:14:50,888 --> 00:14:52,957
IT'S MY WAY OR THE HIGHWAY.

241
00:15:05,469 --> 00:15:07,305
MY WAY OR THE HIGHWAY.

242
00:15:19,884 --> 00:15:23,020
OKAY I WAS THINKING STAR WARS AT THE CINESPHERE.

243
00:15:23,054 --> 00:15:25,423
OKAY PAIGE IS GONNA FREAK!

244
00:15:26,958 --> 00:15:28,960
WHAT, STAR WARS IS LAME?

245
00:15:31,028 --> 00:15:35,833
NO. IT'S JUST - I'D COOL IT ON THE PAIGE FRONT.

246
00:15:40,104 --> 00:15:42,540
SHE'S BUSY, MAN. I MEAN SHE'S GOT MEDIA IMMERSION

247
00:15:42,573 --> 00:15:44,008
SHE'S GOT THE SPIRIT SQUAD...

248
00:15:44,041 --> 00:15:45,977
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

249
00:15:46,010 --> 00:15:49,847
NOTHING! FORGET ABOUT IT. I JUST HEARD... STUFF.

250
00:15:57,989 --> 00:15:59,357
SHE HOOKED UP.

251
00:16:01,092 --> 00:16:03,794
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

252
00:16:03,828 --> 00:16:06,864
THAT PARTY WE WENT TO? SHE WAS THERE.

253
00:16:06,897 --> 00:16:09,934
NO, NO NO NO. HER GRANDMA, HER GRANDMA WAS SICK.

254
00:16:09,967 --> 00:16:11,902
I GOT THE, I GOT THE...

255
00:16:15,039 --> 00:16:17,308
I...I DIDN'T SEE HER THERE.

256
00:16:18,509 --> 00:16:21,979
YEAH UM, THAT'S 'CAUSE SHE WAS UPSTAIRS...

257
00:16:22,013 --> 00:16:23,948
WITH DEAN FROM BARDELL.

258
00:16:36,861 --> 00:16:38,829
PLEASE TAKE OUT YOUR NOVELS.

259
00:16:38,863 --> 00:16:43,467
AS YOU READ QUIETLY, I'LL TAKE A LOOK AT YOUR JOURNALS.

260
00:16:44,402 --> 00:16:45,836
HOW CAN YOU EVEN CONCENTRATE?

261
00:16:45,870 --> 00:16:47,872
THIS IS VERY BIG NEWS, YOU KNOW!

262
00:16:47,905 --> 00:16:49,774
IT'S NOT NEWS, OKAY?

263
00:16:50,141 --> 00:16:51,876
HOW DID YOU KNOW IT WAS RIGHT?

264
00:16:51,909 --> 00:16:53,744
IT'S NOT LIKE I PLANNED IT -

265
00:16:53,778 --> 00:16:54,945
LADIES?

266
00:16:59,016 --> 00:17:00,851
WAS IT TOTALLY ROMANTIC?

267
00:17:00,885 --> 00:17:03,721
CAN WE TALK ABOUT THIS LATER? PLEASE?

268
00:17:03,754 --> 00:17:04,722
I'M TRYING TO READ.

269
00:17:04,755 --> 00:17:07,658
C'MON PAIGE, GIVE ME SOMETHING! I'M DYING HERE!

270
00:17:07,692 --> 00:17:11,429
I'LL CHANGE SEATS IF YOU DON'T SHUT UP, OKAY?

271
00:17:25,976 --> 00:17:26,677
PAIGE.

272
00:17:28,846 --> 00:17:29,814
HEY, SPIN.

273
00:17:29,847 --> 00:17:31,615
HOW'S YOUR GRANDMA?

274
00:17:31,649 --> 00:17:31,849
WHAT?

275
00:17:33,117 --> 00:17:35,786
YOU KNOW YOUR GRANDMA. THE ONE WHO WAS SICK ON SATURDAY NIGHT.

276
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:38,155
OH, UH SHE'S OKAY. THANKS.

277
00:17:38,189 --> 00:17:40,991
AND DEAN? HOW'S HE DOING?

278
00:17:42,093 --> 00:17:44,562
I KNOW WHAT HAPPENED, OKAY?

279
00:17:44,595 --> 00:17:46,764
YEAH? WERE YOU IN THE ROOM WITH ME?

280
00:17:46,797 --> 00:17:49,500
'CAUSE I DON'T THINK YOU WERE.

281
00:17:50,234 --> 00:17:51,769
YOU LIED TO ME.

282
00:17:51,802 --> 00:17:54,905
DON'T TOUCH ME. DON'T EVER TOUCH ME.

283
00:17:54,939 --> 00:17:57,541
WHY NOT? EVERYBODY ELSE DOES.

284
00:18:19,930 --> 00:18:20,197
JT!

285
00:18:22,099 --> 00:18:22,700
WHAT?

286
00:18:25,069 --> 00:18:27,571
YOU RUINED MY SWEATSHIRT!

287
00:18:27,605 --> 00:18:29,006
IT WAS IN MY SPACE.

288
00:18:30,841 --> 00:18:32,843
YOU THREW MY STUFF ON THE FLOOR!

289
00:18:32,877 --> 00:18:33,878
IT WAS DISGUSTING!

290
00:18:33,911 --> 00:18:35,913
IT WASN'T YOUR PROPERTY!

291
00:18:37,815 --> 00:18:39,617
UH, BOYS.

292
00:18:40,951 --> 00:18:43,788
WHAT SEEMS TO BE THE PROBLEM HERE?

293
00:18:45,990 --> 00:18:48,159
PAIGE? I JUST SAW SPINNER.

294
00:18:52,096 --> 00:18:54,799
HE WAS COMPLETELY OUT OF LINE.

295
00:18:54,832 --> 00:18:57,968
IT WASN'T WHAT I THOUGHT, YOU KNOW.

296
00:18:58,869 --> 00:19:03,908
FIRST TIME - I KINDA HOPED IT'D BE BEAUTIFUL OR SOMETHING.

297
00:19:06,777 --> 00:19:08,212
IT'S SO STUPID.

298
00:19:08,245 --> 00:19:09,180
IT'S NOT STUPID.

299
00:19:09,213 --> 00:19:11,782
THOSE SHOES...I WANTED IT TO WORK.

300
00:19:11,816 --> 00:19:13,884
I WANTED HIM TO WANT TO BE WITH ME.

301
00:19:13,918 --> 00:19:14,718
HE DID!

302
00:19:15,186 --> 00:19:16,787
YEAH. SURE.

303
00:19:16,821 --> 00:19:17,788
HE'LL CALL YOU.

304
00:19:17,822 --> 00:19:20,224
YOU DON'T HAVE TO GET SO UPSET.

305
00:19:21,859 --> 00:19:24,562
I DIDN'T EVEN WANT TO DO IT, HAZEL!

306
00:19:24,595 --> 00:19:26,597
I SAID NO OVER AND OVER.

307
00:19:28,032 --> 00:19:30,868
YOU SAID NO? AND HE DIDN'T LISTEN?

308
00:19:32,636 --> 00:19:35,739
HE JUST - PUSHED ME DOWN HARDER.

309
00:19:35,773 --> 00:19:38,509
HE DIDN'T STOP, HE WOULDN'T STOP.

310
00:19:40,911 --> 00:19:44,615
PAIGE. HONEY. IF YOU SAID NO? THAT'S RAPE.

311
00:19:59,263 --> 00:20:00,331
AND BOYS I WANT YOU TO KNOW

312
00:20:00,364 --> 00:20:02,600
I APPRECIATE WHAT IT IS YOU ARE DOING FOR DEGRASSI

313
00:20:02,633 --> 00:20:05,269
BY VOLUNTEERING TO SHARE. BUT YOU TWO ARE STUCK TOGETHER.

314
00:20:05,302 --> 00:20:07,738
SO I WANT YOU TO REMEMBER WHAT THE THREE 'C''S ARE.

315
00:20:07,771 --> 00:20:08,906
WHAT ARE THEY AGAIN?

316
00:20:08,939 --> 00:20:13,143
COHABITATION REQUIRES COORDINATED COOPERATION.

317
00:20:13,177 --> 00:20:18,182
EXCELLENT. VERY GOOD. SO, GET ALONG. END OF STORY.

318
00:20:25,322 --> 00:20:30,261
MY PARENTS ARE GOING TO KILL ME FOR DOING THIS, BUT...

319
00:20:50,247 --> 00:20:52,716
PAIGE. HEY WAIT UP.

320
00:20:54,652 --> 00:20:56,987
WHATEVER HAPPENED TO GOING TO THE DOCTOR AFTER SCHOOL?

321
00:20:57,021 --> 00:20:57,988
WHY WOULD I?

322
00:20:58,022 --> 00:21:01,191
I DON'T KNOW - TO CHECK ON STDS, PREGNANCY...

323
00:21:01,225 --> 00:21:04,828
HE WORE A CONDOM. SAFE SEX ALL THE WAY. I'M FINE.

324
00:21:04,862 --> 00:21:07,164
WHAT DEAN DID WAS ILLEGAL. YOU KNOW THAT, RIGHT?

325
00:21:07,197 --> 00:21:09,166
YEAH? AND WHAT ABOUT WHAT I DID?

326
00:21:09,199 --> 00:21:10,401
YOU DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.

327
00:21:10,434 --> 00:21:12,870
SO I DIDN'T DRESS LIKE A SLUT? I DIDN'T DRINK?

328
00:21:12,903 --> 00:21:15,906
I DIDN'T COME ON TO HIM IN FRONT OF THE WHOLE PARTY?

329
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:16,640
PAIGE.

330
00:21:17,808 --> 00:21:18,976
I GUESS I DIDN'T ASK HIM TO GO UPSTAIRS EITHER?

331
00:21:19,009 --> 00:21:20,244
YOU SAID NO.

332
00:21:20,277 --> 00:21:21,245
IT DOESN'T MATTER.

333
00:21:21,278 --> 00:21:23,948
IT DOES MATTER. PAIGE, YOU HAVE TO TELL SOMEONE.

334
00:21:23,981 --> 00:21:26,050
NO, I DON'T. I CAN DEAL WITH IT.

335
00:21:26,083 --> 00:21:27,885
PAIGE, YOU WERE RAPED.

336
00:21:27,918 --> 00:21:31,121
LOOK. MY BUSINESS. MY PROBLEM. I'M FINE.
