YEAH. YEAH. ME, TOO.

7

I MEAN LAST YEAR WE WERE JUST - THIS THING BUT,

00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:40,005
NOW WE REALLY CONNECT.

9
00:00:45,944 --> 00:00:48,013

WITH A PINK WHISTLE ON IT,

24
00:01:56,682 --> 00:01:57,983
PLEASE SEE MRS. SMITH IN THE OFFICE

25
00:01:58,016 --> 00:01:59,751
TO IDENTIFY IT AND PICK IT UP.

26
00:02:01,687 --> 00:02:03,455
LOOKING FOR SOMEONE?

27
00:02:03,488 --> 00:02:06,024
YEAH, ACTUALLY. MY BOYFRIEND.

28
00:02:06,058 --> 00:02:10,562
TALL, CUTE. YOU MIGHT'VE SEEN US TOGETHER LAST YEAR?

29
00:02:10,595 --> 00:02:14,933
SPEAKING OF LAST YEAR - GRADE EIGHT YEAR BOOK.

30
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:18,003
GRADE EIGHT - NOT EXACTLY MY BEST.

31
00:02:18,036 --> 00:02:22,741
SOME OF IT WAS PRETTY GOOD. SO WILL YOU SIGN IT?

32
00:02:23,175 --> 00:02:25,644
WE'RE BACK TOGETHER NOW, RIGHT?

33
00:02:25,677 --> 00:02:27,879
BACK TOGETHER. SOUNDS NICE.

34
00:02:27,913 --> 00:02:29,114
SO SIGN IT?

35
00:02:31,983 --> 00:02:34,553
OKAY, DID MY MOM PICK OUT MY CLOTHES?

36
00:02:34,586 --> 00:02:35,921
YOU LOOK GREAT.

37
00:02:35,954 --> 00:02:36,788
I LOOK AWFUL.

38
00:02:36,822 --> 00:02:38,990
YOU GOT THAT RIGHT, FREAKSHOW.

39
00:02:39,024 --> 00:02:39,591
TRY LOOKING IN THE MIRROR.

40
00:02:39,624 --> 00:02:40,792
FREAKSHOW.

41
00:02:40,826 --> 00:02:41,927
BE CAREFUL, JIMMY.

42
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,095
ALTHOUGH IT IS NICE OF YOU TO DATE THE CREEPY CHICKS,

43
00:02:43,128 --> 00:02:46,198
LEAVE THE HOT ONES FOR US.

44
00:02:46,231 --> 00:02:48,834
SHUT UP. I'M SORRY ASH.

45
00:02:50,035 --> 00:02:52,003
HAPPENS ALL THE TIME.

46
00:02:52,037 --> 00:02:53,538
IF JERKS LIKE HIM KNEW HOW BEAUTIFUL YOU WERE

47
00:02:53,572 --> 00:02:57,843
ON THE INSIDE, THEY'D KEEP THEIR MOUTHS SHUT.

48
00:02:59,544 --> 00:03:01,213
IT'S THE EVENT OF THE YEAR.

49
00:03:01,246 --> 00:03:03,181
DR. SALLY'S SEX-TALK.

50
00:03:03,215 --> 00:03:04,116
AS IF I COULD FORGET ABOUT HER

51
00:03:04,149 --> 00:03:06,051
WITH YOU TALKING ABOUT IT EVERY TWO SECONDS.

52
00:03:06,084 --> 00:03:08,053
FIRST YOU GET THE KNOWLEDGE, THEN YOU GET THE POWER.

53
00:03:08,086 --> 00:03:09,955
THEN YOU GET-

54
00:03:11,022 --> 00:03:11,790
WHAT?

55
00:03:11,823 --> 00:03:15,060
BELIEVE ME, YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW.

56
00:03:15,794 --> 00:03:18,830
NOW, IN ADDITION TO CONDOMS, WE HAVE THE PILL,

57
00:03:18,864 --> 00:03:21,533
THE DIAPHRAGM AND THE IUD.

58
00:03:23,135 --> 00:03:25,937
GUYS, THERE'S NOTHING TO BE EMBARRASSED ABOUT.

59
00:03:25,971 --> 00:03:27,172
MAYBE WE'D FEEL A LITTLE MORE COMFORTABLE

60
00:03:27,205 --> 00:03:29,007
IF DR. SALLY WAS HERE.

61
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,909
LIKE I TOLD YOU AT THE BEGINNING OF THE CLASS,

62
00:03:30,942 --> 00:03:33,078
DR. SALLY IS IN CHINA.

63
00:03:33,111 --> 00:03:36,915
WELL, SEND HER A PLANE TICKET OR SOMETHING.

64
00:03:36,948 --> 00:03:40,886
BEING SEXUALLY RESPONSIBLE MEANS BEING PREPARED.

65
00:03:40,919 --> 00:03:44,990
BUT THE BEST FORM OF PROTECTION IS ABSTINENCE.

66
00:03:45,023 --> 00:03:46,992
WHAT'S-WHAT'S 'ABSTINENCE'?

67
00:03:47,025 --> 00:03:48,093
NOT HAVING SEX.

68
00:03:48,126 --> 00:03:52,697
NO SEX, YOU DON'T GET PREGNANT OR CONTRACT AN STD.

69
00:03:59,004 --> 00:04:02,073
HOWEVER, IF YOU DECIDE NOT TO ABSTAIN,

70
00:04:02,107 --> 00:04:05,811
MAKE SURE YOU ALWAYS HAVE A CONDOM ON YOU.

71
00:04:11,316 --> 00:04:13,118
UNTIL NEXT TIME WE HOPE YOU ENJOYED

72
00:04:13,151 --> 00:04:18,290
THIS CLASSIC PRESENTATION OF 'TAMING OF THE SHREW.'

73
00:04:18,323 --> 00:04:19,157
SO.

74
00:04:20,225 --> 00:04:23,195
ANY THOUGHTS ON SHAKESPEARE'S COMIC MASTERPIECE?

75
00:04:23,228 --> 00:04:23,929
GAVIN?

76
00:04:25,130 --> 00:04:27,666
UM, MAYBE ADD A JOKE OR TWO?

77
00:04:27,699 --> 00:04:28,967
YOU DIDN'T FIND IT FUNNY?

78
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,036
FUNNY? UH - NO. SORRY.

79
00:04:32,871 --> 00:04:34,639
NO NEED TO APOLOGIZE.

80
00:04:34,673 --> 00:04:36,908
BECAUSE I'M OFFERING YOU ALL A CHALLENGE -

81
00:04:36,942 --> 00:04:38,643
I'VE PAIRED YOU UP,

82
00:04:38,677 --> 00:04:41,980
AND I WANT YOU TO WORK ON ACT TWO, SCENE ONE.

83
00:04:42,013 --> 00:04:44,115
THIS PLAY'S BEEN AROUND FOR OVER FOUR-HUNDRED YEARS,

84
00:04:44,149 --> 00:04:46,785
SO IT MUST BE DOING SOMETHING RIGHT.

85
00:04:46,818 --> 00:04:51,990
WHAT I WANT, GUYS, IS A VERSION THAT RINGS TRUE FOR YOU.

86
00:04:52,824 --> 00:04:54,759
HAVE FUN WITH IT.

87
00:05:01,032 --> 00:05:02,267
ATTENTION STAFF AND STUDENTS-

88
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:05,704
"GOOD MORROW, KATE; FOR THAT'S YOUR NAME, I HEAR."

89
00:05:05,737 --> 00:05:08,106
HEY I WAS THINKING ABOUT OUR SCENE.

90
00:05:08,139 --> 00:05:09,274
AND YOU WANTED TO SHOOT YOURSELF?

91
00:05:09,307 --> 00:05:12,043
I CAN'T BELIEVE WE HAVE TO DO THIS "COMEDY". IT'S SO -

92
00:05:12,077 --> 00:05:14,946
SEXIST? OUTDATED? UNFUNNY?

93
00:05:16,014 --> 00:05:17,883
ALL THREE. SO I WAS THINKING--

94
00:05:17,916 --> 00:05:19,150
WHY DON'T WE SHOW THAT,

95
00:05:19,184 --> 00:05:23,121
AND PLAY IT FOR WHAT'S REALLY GOING ON.

96
00:05:25,056 --> 00:05:26,191
OR NOT...?

97
00:05:27,259 --> 00:05:28,994
NO. TOTALLY.

98
00:05:29,027 --> 00:05:31,029
I'M JUST - SO GLAD WE'RE ON THE SAME PAGE.

99
00:05:31,062 --> 00:05:34,099
YEAH? KWAN'S GONNA REGRET PAIRING US.

100
00:05:34,132 --> 00:05:35,200
WAS IT JUST ME,

101
00:05:35,233 --> 00:05:37,168
OR WAS HEALTH CLASS MORE THAN A LITTLE CONFUSING?

102
00:05:37,202 --> 00:05:41,806
WHY? BECAUSE DR. SALLY LET US DOWN, BECAUSE DR. SALLY DIDN'T-

103
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:44,009
WOULD YOU SHUT UP ALREADY?

104
00:05:44,309 --> 00:05:47,078
I MEAN CONDOMS. THEY'RE CONFUSING.

105
00:05:47,112 --> 00:05:48,647
WELL, THEY'RE PRETTY SIMPLE, TOBES.

106
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:51,316
YOU JUST OPEN THE PACKAGE, SLIP 'EM ON AND--

107
00:05:51,349 --> 00:05:54,819
I MEAN - YOU KNOW, WHEN DO WE BUY THEM?

108
00:05:57,155 --> 00:05:59,691
NO TIME LIKE THE PRESENT.

109
00:05:59,724 --> 00:06:01,660
KNOW THE DRILL, PRACTICE.

110
00:06:01,693 --> 00:06:06,298
I MEAN, WE COULD MEET THE WOMAN OF OUR DREAMS TOMORROW!

111
00:06:06,331 --> 00:06:08,133
I ALREADY MET MINE.

112
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:13,004
LOOK.

113
00:06:13,038 --> 00:06:16,007
THAT IS EXACTLY WHY YOU WANT TO BE PREPARED.

114
00:06:16,041 --> 00:06:17,876
IT'S WAY TOO EARLY FOR THAT.

115
00:06:17,909 --> 00:06:20,011
WHAT IF PASSION TAKES OVER SOME DAY?

116
00:06:20,045 --> 00:06:24,049
AND YOU, TOBY ISSACS GET A CHANCE TO GET IT.

117
00:06:24,082 --> 00:06:26,217
DON'T YOU WANT TO BE PREPARED?

118
00:06:26,251 --> 00:06:27,252
I GUESS...?

119
00:06:27,285 --> 00:06:28,920
YES, YOU DO.

120
00:06:28,954 --> 00:06:33,258
SO - DRUGSTORE, AFTER SCHOOL. OUR STUDLY FUTURE CALLS.

121
00:06:39,397 --> 00:06:41,232
THE CONCEPT'S HILARIOUS.

122
00:06:41,266 --> 00:06:45,103
"ASSES ARE MADE TO BEAR, AND SO ARE YOU!"

123
00:06:45,136 --> 00:06:45,937
HEY GUYS.

124
00:06:45,971 --> 00:06:49,374
YOUR BOYFRIEND? HYSTERICAL. CIAO.

125
00:06:51,276 --> 00:06:53,078
SOMEONE'S HAVING FUN.

126
00:06:53,111 --> 00:06:55,080
YEAH. OUR SCENE SHOULD BE GOOD.

127
00:06:55,113 --> 00:06:55,981
OF COURSE, NOT AS GOOD AS IF I HAD WORKED

128
00:06:56,014 --> 00:06:58,883
WITH MY FAVOURITE PARTNER.

129
00:07:00,151 --> 00:07:01,353
THAT'S A JOKE, RIGHT?

130
00:07:01,386 --> 00:07:02,821
BURN IT, PLEASE.

131
00:07:02,854 --> 00:07:05,256
AW, BUT YOU LOOK SO CUTE.

132
00:07:06,992 --> 00:07:07,826
SO - DINNER.

133
00:07:07,859 --> 00:07:10,261
JEFF'S MAKING BURGERS AND KRAFT DINNER.

134
00:07:10,295 --> 00:07:11,796
YOU KNOW, MY PARENTS MISSED YOU.

135
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:13,064
SO DID I.

136
00:07:13,098 --> 00:07:16,101
I'M SO GLAD YOU'RE COMING.

137
00:07:20,438 --> 00:07:23,241
J.T., YOU DO NOT NEED EXTRA-LARGE.

138
00:07:23,274 --> 00:07:25,910
WHAT DOES THIS MEAN? RIBBED.

139
00:07:25,944 --> 00:07:28,113
FOR HER PLEASURE? NO IDEA.

140
00:07:29,147 --> 00:07:30,982
HM. BETTER FIND OUT.

141
00:07:31,016 --> 00:07:33,385
DID YOU SEE THE UH - PINA COLADA FLAVOUR?

142
00:07:33,418 --> 00:07:34,152
YEAH.

143
00:07:34,185 --> 00:07:35,954
TOO BAD THEY DON'T HAVE BACON.

144
00:07:38,490 --> 00:07:40,692
SO WHAT'D YOU GET?

145
00:07:42,193 --> 00:07:43,128
OH.

146
00:07:45,130 --> 00:07:47,932
THE FORCE IS STRONG WITHIN YOU.

147
00:07:53,371 --> 00:07:55,373
COME ON, LET'S GO.

148
00:07:57,075 --> 00:07:58,076
NO, COME ON.

149
00:08:00,111 --> 00:08:02,947
OKAY, SO CALL ME LATER? OKAY, BYE.

150
00:08:04,816 --> 00:08:07,018
WE JUST WANT TO BE READY, YOU KNOW.

151
00:08:07,052 --> 00:08:11,990
HE-HE DOES. AND-AND ME. TOGETHER. BUT NOT - TOGETHER.

152
00:08:14,993 --> 00:08:18,797
UH - COULD WE HAVE THOSE IN SEPARATE BAGS, PLEASE?

153
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:21,366
AND UH - MAYBE YOUR PHONE NUMBER?

154
00:08:31,509 --> 00:08:33,945
SO DID DR. SALLY COME TODAY?

155
00:08:33,978 --> 00:08:36,247
UH - NO. ARMSTRONG FILLED IN.

156
00:08:36,281 --> 00:08:37,382
DID HE GIVE OUT CONDOMS?

157
00:08:37,415 --> 00:08:38,016
WHAT?

158
00:08:41,386 --> 00:08:44,989
NO, NOT THAT THAT'S ANY OF YOUR BUSINESS!

159
00:08:45,490 --> 00:08:48,359
RELAX. I JUST THINK THAT KIDS SHOULD HAVE ACCESS TO CONDOMS.

160
00:08:48,393 --> 00:08:51,329
IT'S AN IMPORTANT ISSUE, EH JIMMY?

161
00:08:51,362 --> 00:08:54,065
SURE IT IS. UH - I'M STARVING.

162
00:08:56,067 --> 00:08:58,136
I DON'T KNOW.

163
00:08:58,169 --> 00:08:59,571
TEACHERS GIVING OUT CONDOMS SUGGESTS

164
00:08:59,604 --> 00:09:02,207
THAT KIDS SHOULD BE HAVING SEX.

165
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,476
WELL, KIDS ARE GONNA HAVE SEX, JEFF -

166
00:09:04,509 --> 00:09:06,377
BUT AT LEAST THEY SHOULD BE PROTECTED.

167
00:09:06,411 --> 00:09:08,480
JIMMY? WHAT DO YOU THINK?

168
00:09:09,981 --> 00:09:13,818
I'M NOT SURE. YOU ALL HAVE REALLY GOOD POINTS.

169
00:09:15,253 --> 00:09:17,388
OKAY, AND WHAT'S YOUR POINT?

170
00:09:18,957 --> 00:09:20,425
I THINK JEFF'S RIGHT.

171
00:09:20,458 --> 00:09:24,429
HANDING OUT CONDOMS SENDS A MESSAGE. SORRY.

172
00:09:24,462 --> 00:09:27,065
DON'T BE. YOU'RE ALLOWED TO HAVE AN OPINION.

173
00:09:27,098 --> 00:09:31,102
I JUST WISH I DIDN'T HAVE TO DRAG IT OUT OF YOU.

174
00:09:44,382 --> 00:09:45,984
WHAT'RE YOU DOING?

175
00:09:46,017 --> 00:09:47,385
YOU'RE THE GENIUS WHO TALKED ME INTO BUYING THEM.

176
00:09:47,418 --> 00:09:50,221
THEY'RE YOUR PROBLEM NOW.

177
00:09:52,290 --> 00:09:54,526
"FOR I AM BORN TO TAME YOU, KATE.

178
00:09:54,559 --> 00:10:00,298
AND BRING YOU FROM A WILD KATE, TO A KATE CONFROR- CONFROBAB-"

179
00:10:02,033 --> 00:10:04,602
THAT'S IT, SPINNER - WALK AND TALK.

180
00:10:04,636 --> 00:10:06,104
HA HA HA.

181
00:10:11,142 --> 00:10:12,544
OOH, J.T. THE STUD.

182
00:10:14,379 --> 00:10:15,446
CHECK THIS OUT.

183
00:10:16,281 --> 00:10:17,615
GUYS, THEY'RE NOT MINE.

184
00:10:17,649 --> 00:10:19,284
THEN WHOSE ARE THEY?

185
00:10:19,317 --> 00:10:21,352
THEY MUST BE TOBY'S. THAT'S GROSS.

186
00:10:21,386 --> 00:10:23,988
EW. THAT IS SO CLASSIC.

187
00:10:26,524 --> 00:10:30,128
TOBY? KENDRA? HE'S PLANNING ON-

188
00:10:30,528 --> 00:10:31,663
WITH MY SISTER?

189
00:10:31,696 --> 00:10:33,298
NO, SPINNER - IT'S JUST--

190
00:10:33,331 --> 00:10:36,167
WHEN I FIND ISAACS, HE'S FINISHED.

191
00:10:40,305 --> 00:10:43,975
ATTENTION STAFF AND VISITORS, THERE IS A DARK GREEN MINIVAN-

192
00:10:44,008 --> 00:10:45,910
YOU NEED SOME HELP WITH THAT?

193
00:10:45,944 --> 00:10:47,478
SURE. IT'S FOR JIMMY.

194
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:49,280
YEAH.

195
00:10:55,286 --> 00:10:55,887
THANKS.

196
00:10:57,322 --> 00:10:59,524
NO PROBLEM. HOPE HE LIKES IT.

197
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:04,662
JIMMY. FOR YOUR LOCKER.

198
00:11:04,696 --> 00:11:05,964
THANKS.

199
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:19,043
UM, IT'S SUPPOSED TO REPLACE THAT ONE.

200
00:11:19,077 --> 00:11:22,380
MORE PICTURES OF YOU, THE BETTER.

201
00:11:22,413 --> 00:11:23,348
WHAT?

202
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:26,417
NOTHING. JUST--

203
00:11:27,218 --> 00:11:27,952
WHAT?

204
00:11:29,554 --> 00:11:32,056
WHICH PICTURE DO YOU LIKE BETTER?

205
00:11:32,090 --> 00:11:33,057
I LIKE THEM BOTH.

206
00:11:33,091 --> 00:11:34,292
YOU DIDN'T ANSWER MY QUESTION.

207
00:11:34,325 --> 00:11:35,393
ASH--

208
00:11:35,426 --> 00:11:39,330
SPEAK YOUR MIND. I MEAN IT. WHICH DO YOU LIKE MORE?

209
00:11:41,399 --> 00:11:44,469
THE OLD ONE, OKAY? THE OLD ONE.

210
00:12:21,339 --> 00:12:22,707
ATTENTION.

211
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:24,642
IT HAS COME TO MY ATTENTION THAT INCREASING AMOUNTS

212
00:12:24,676 --> 00:12:26,678
OF LITTER ARE BEING LEFT IN THE HALLWAY,

213
00:12:26,711 --> 00:12:29,480
PLEASE BE CONSIDERATE AND PICK UP AFTER YOURSELVES...

214
00:12:29,514 --> 00:12:30,515
(Bell Rings)

215
00:12:35,086 --> 00:12:38,623
WOULD NICOLE HAMILTON PLEASE REPORT TO THE MAIN OFFICE IMMEDIATELY...

216
00:12:38,656 --> 00:12:40,525
AGAIN - NICOLE HAMILTON.

217
00:12:44,662 --> 00:12:47,465
I'LL BE HONEST. I DON'T GET IT.

218
00:12:48,599 --> 00:12:52,270
THIS IS WHO I'VE BEEN SINCE BEFORE WE MET.

219
00:12:52,303 --> 00:12:53,571
ASH! WOW.

220
00:12:54,539 --> 00:12:57,742
WELL, YOU-YOU ACTUALLY LOOK... ALIVE.

221
00:12:59,577 --> 00:13:00,511
THANKS. I THINK.

222
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:04,182
I WAS JUST GETTING USED TO THE WHOLE GOTH THING.

223
00:13:04,215 --> 00:13:05,216
THIS IS SO--

224
00:13:06,584 --> 00:13:07,585
TAMED?

225
00:13:10,421 --> 00:13:14,258
EVERYONE TAKE YOUR SEATS, PLEASE.

226
00:13:14,292 --> 00:13:17,295
SPINNERS LOCKER PAGE? WHY DO YOU WANT ME TO DIE?

227
00:13:17,328 --> 00:13:19,330
I'M TRYING TO SAVE YOUR LIFE.

228
00:13:19,364 --> 00:13:22,066
LOOK, IF WE CAN FIGURE OUT HIS SCHEDULE,

229
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:24,569
MAYBE YOU CAN TRY TO AVOID HIM FOR THE REST OF THE YEAR.

230
00:13:24,602 --> 00:13:28,639
AND WHAT ABOUT KENDRA? SHE PROBABLY THINKS I'M SLIME.

231
00:13:28,673 --> 00:13:31,676
YOU'LL EXPLAIN IT TO HER, SHE'LL UNDERSTAND.

232
00:13:31,709 --> 00:13:34,412
EVERYTHING WILL BE FINE.

233
00:13:39,517 --> 00:13:40,118
OR NOT.

234
00:13:43,721 --> 00:13:45,256
DON'T OPEN IT!

235
00:13:45,289 --> 00:13:47,125
TOO LATE.

236
00:14:06,577 --> 00:14:07,311
OH GOOD--

237
00:14:09,414 --> 00:14:10,715
HOW OLD AM I?

238
00:14:10,748 --> 00:14:12,283
UH. TWELVE.

239
00:14:12,316 --> 00:14:14,719
AND WHAT GRADE AM I IN?

240
00:14:14,752 --> 00:14:15,686
SEVEN?

241
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:20,258
AND YOU THOUGHT I'D HAVE SEX WITH YOU? PERVERT!

242
00:14:26,197 --> 00:14:28,366
I KNOW, I LOVE EXISTENTIAL JEANS.

243
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:29,634
THE FIT IS LIKE, PERFECT.

244
00:14:29,667 --> 00:14:31,502
YEAH, I LOVE THE COMMERCIAL. WHEN THAT HOT GUY SAYS -

245
00:14:31,536 --> 00:14:34,205
"LIFE IS MEANINGLESS WITHOUT JEANS."

246
00:14:34,238 --> 00:14:36,407
"EXISTENTIAL!" HAHAHA.

247
00:14:36,707 --> 00:14:38,509
I HAVEN'T SEEN THAT ONE.

248
00:14:38,543 --> 00:14:41,212
DON'T WORRY - WE'LL GET YOU BACK IN THE LOOP.

249
00:14:41,245 --> 00:14:45,716
SPEAKING OF LOOP - WHAT'S WITH THE STYLE REWIND, ANYWAY?

250
00:14:46,717 --> 00:14:48,319
YOU DON'T LIKE IT?

251
00:14:48,352 --> 00:14:50,822
SURE, BUT THE GOTH LOOK WAS SORTA WORKING FOR YOU.

252
00:14:50,855 --> 00:14:52,323
WHY THE CHANGE?

253
00:14:54,325 --> 00:14:57,261
I HAVE TO GO, I HAVE TO MEET CRAIG.

254
00:15:05,503 --> 00:15:08,639
FOR I AM BORN TO TAME YOU KATE AND--

255
00:15:08,673 --> 00:15:09,507
HEY.

256
00:15:11,709 --> 00:15:13,444
SORRY I'M LATE.

257
00:15:14,579 --> 00:15:15,780
AND YOU ARE--?

258
00:15:15,813 --> 00:15:18,683
LATE. SORRY. CAN WE START?

259
00:15:19,951 --> 00:15:20,718
YEAH. SURE.

260
00:15:24,755 --> 00:15:28,759
"GOOD MORROW, KATE; FOR THAT'S YOUR NAME I HEAR."

261
00:15:28,793 --> 00:15:29,727
WAIT.

262
00:15:30,628 --> 00:15:32,597
WHAT, NOT STRONG ENOUGH?

263
00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:35,299
NO. IT'S JUST-- THE WAY PETRUCHIO WANTS TO CHANGE KATE.

264
00:15:35,333 --> 00:15:37,201
ISN'T IT OUT OF LOVE?

265
00:15:37,235 --> 00:15:39,770
THAT'S WHAT HE CLAIMS. SO?

266
00:15:39,804 --> 00:15:42,406
SO, WE'RE MAKING HIM INTO A VILLAIN. WHAT IF WE'RE WRONG?

267
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:45,643
ASH, THE GUY'S A SEXIST PIG. AND ABUSIVE.

268
00:15:47,278 --> 00:15:48,980
I KNOW. I READ THE PLAY, BUT--

269
00:15:49,013 --> 00:15:52,717
BUT - NOTHING. EVEN IF HE WASN'T, HE'D STILL BE A JERK.

270
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:54,218
WHY?

271
00:15:54,252 --> 00:15:55,953
BECAUSE IF HE REALLY LOVED KATE

272
00:15:55,987 --> 00:16:01,259
HE WOULDN'T WANT TO CHANGE HER. HE'D LOVE HER FOR WHO SHE IS.

273
00:16:10,835 --> 00:16:12,870
IT'S JUDGMENT DAY, ISAACS.

274
00:16:12,904 --> 00:16:14,105
GO AHEAD.

275
00:16:14,138 --> 00:16:16,507
BUT I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT THE REASON I BOUGHT THAT STUFF

276
00:16:16,541 --> 00:16:18,676
WAS 'CAUSE I REALLY LIKE YOUR SISTER.

277
00:16:18,709 --> 00:16:20,678
I MEAN, I REALLY LIKE HER,

278
00:16:20,711 --> 00:16:23,481
BUT I WASN'T THINKING OF HAVING SEX WITH HER -

279
00:16:23,514 --> 00:16:25,783
WE'VE ONLY KISSED. ONE TIME.

280
00:16:25,816 --> 00:16:27,318
IF YOU WEREN'T THINKING ABOUT IT,

281
00:16:27,351 --> 00:16:29,020
WHY'D YOU BUY ALL THAT STUFF?

282
00:16:29,053 --> 00:16:31,656
BECAUSE - IF I WAS GOING TO HAVE SEX WITH KENDRA,

283
00:16:31,689 --> 00:16:35,426
WHICH I'M NOT - I'D WANT TO TAKE CARE OF HER.

284
00:16:37,028 --> 00:16:39,030
I MEAN, HAVING SEX NEVER EVEN OCCURRED TO ME

285
00:16:39,063 --> 00:16:41,799
UNTIL J.T. STARTED TALKING ABOUT BEING PREPARED--

286
00:16:41,832 --> 00:16:44,936
J.T.? SO THIS WAS J.T.'S IDEA.

287
00:16:44,969 --> 00:16:46,671
NO. NO, NO, NO.

288
00:16:46,704 --> 00:16:48,506
HE JUST SUGGESTED THAT I BUY THAT STUFF,

289
00:16:48,539 --> 00:16:51,375
YOU KNOW, YOU KNOW, JUST IN CASE--

290
00:16:57,882 --> 00:16:59,550
BREAK A LEG.

291
00:16:59,584 --> 00:17:00,651
YOU, TOO.

292
00:17:01,686 --> 00:17:02,753
YOU OKAY?

293
00:17:03,854 --> 00:17:06,791
YEAH. JUST - A LITTLE NERVOUS.

294
00:17:06,824 --> 00:17:10,595
YOU'LL BE GREAT. AND I'LL BE RIGHT THERE, WATCHING.

295
00:17:10,628 --> 00:17:12,563
YOU GUYS ARE SO CUTE!

296
00:17:20,338 --> 00:17:23,407
"KATE; IN SOOTH YOU SCAPE NOT SO."

297
00:17:23,441 --> 00:17:24,942
"I CHAFE YOU IF I TARRY; LET ME GO."

298
00:17:24,976 --> 00:17:28,946
"NAY, FOR I AM BORN TO TAME YOU, KATE,

299
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:32,350
AND BRING YOU FROM A WILD KATE TO A KATE CONFORMABLE

300
00:17:32,383 --> 00:17:34,452
AS OTHER HOUSEHOLD KATES.

301
00:17:34,885 --> 00:17:38,589
I MUST AND WILL HAVE KATHERINE TO MY WIFE!"

302
00:17:42,994 --> 00:17:45,463
GIMME AN L-O-V-E-! GO LOVE!

303
00:17:54,772 --> 00:17:56,741
SO - THOUGHTS?

304
00:17:56,774 --> 00:17:58,342
IT KEPT MY ATTENTION.

305
00:17:58,376 --> 00:18:00,778
ME, TOO. LOVE THE COSTUMES.

306
00:18:00,811 --> 00:18:02,580
WHY FOOTBALL?

307
00:18:02,613 --> 00:18:04,515
WELL, WE THOUGHT ADDING A MODERN TWIST

308
00:18:04,548 --> 00:18:05,850
WOULD MAKE IT FUNNIER.

309
00:18:05,883 --> 00:18:07,051
PETRUCHIO'S A MANLY-MAN.

310
00:18:07,084 --> 00:18:09,053
MAKING HIM A FOOTBALL PLAYER SEEMED PERFECT.

311
00:18:09,086 --> 00:18:11,422
AND HE MAKES KATE INTO THE PERFECT WIFE FOR HIM -

312
00:18:11,455 --> 00:18:12,923
HIS OWN CHEERLEADER.

313
00:18:16,127 --> 00:18:17,628
GOOD JOB.

314
00:18:17,662 --> 00:18:19,664
OKAY - ASHLEY AND CRAIG?

315
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:23,634
YOU READY?

316
00:18:24,869 --> 00:18:26,337
YEAH. FOR REAL.

317
00:18:47,858 --> 00:18:50,761
"KATE; IN SOOTH YOU SCAPE NOT SO."

318
00:18:50,795 --> 00:18:52,797
"I CHAFE YOU IF I TARRY; LET ME GO!"

319
00:18:52,830 --> 00:18:56,634
"NAY, THOU MUST BE MARRIED TO NO MAN BUT ME.

320
00:18:57,435 --> 00:18:59,904
FOR I AM BORN TO TAME YOU, KATE,

321
00:19:00,705 --> 00:19:04,108
AND BRING YOU FROM A WILD KATE TO A KATE CONFORMABLE

322
00:19:04,141 --> 00:19:06,744
AS OTHER HOUSEHOLD KATES.

323
00:19:07,445 --> 00:19:10,748
I MUST AND WILL HAVE KATHERINE TO MY WIFE!"

324
00:19:26,964 --> 00:19:28,032
WOW. INTENSE.

325
00:19:31,836 --> 00:19:35,639
UH, YEAH. WE SAW IT A BIT DIFFERENTLY.

326
00:19:35,673 --> 00:19:35,806
ASH?

327
00:19:37,174 --> 00:19:41,979
IT DIDN'T SEEM LIKE A COMEDY TO US. IT FELT - DARKER.

328
00:19:42,012 --> 00:19:45,049
CAN YOU TELL US WHY YOU FELT THAT?

329
00:19:45,082 --> 00:19:48,652
IT'S ABOUT BREAKING A PERSON, THEIR SPIRIT.

330
00:19:48,686 --> 00:19:50,554
TAMING THEM AND MAKING THEM INTO SOMEONE

331
00:19:50,588 --> 00:19:52,223
THAT THEY AREN'T...

332
00:19:52,256 --> 00:19:56,460
MAKING THEM INTO A LESSER VERSION OF THEMSELVES.

333
00:20:06,804 --> 00:20:09,874
ISAACS. JUST THE MAN I WAS LOOKING FOR.

334
00:20:13,010 --> 00:20:15,012
LIKE HIS NEW LOOK?

335
00:20:17,047 --> 00:20:19,583
OKAY, AND NOW FOR YOUR FEET.

336
00:20:20,584 --> 00:20:21,652
NO, SPINNER PLEASE, PLEASE.

337
00:20:21,685 --> 00:20:24,655
I PROMISE I'LL NEVER BUY CONDOMS AGAIN.

338
00:20:24,688 --> 00:20:28,626
IT IS NOT ABOUT BUYING CONDOMS. IT'S ABOUT KENDRA.

339
00:20:28,659 --> 00:20:30,728
THERE'S ENOUGH PRESSURE OUT THERE ABOUT HAVING SEX.

340
00:20:30,761 --> 00:20:33,831
SHE DOESN'T NEED ANY MORE FROM YOU TWO.

341
00:20:35,666 --> 00:20:39,737
NOW LADIES AND GENTLEMEN... ISSACS, HIT THE LIGHTS-

342
00:20:41,071 --> 00:20:44,041
I GIVE YOU, THE HUMAN GLOW-WORM.

343
00:20:44,074 --> 00:20:45,910
(LAUGHTER)

344
00:20:56,887 --> 00:20:57,221
HEY.

345
00:20:58,989 --> 00:20:59,523
HEY.

346
00:21:01,826 --> 00:21:03,894
I SIGNED IT LIKE YOU ASKED.

347
00:21:07,832 --> 00:21:12,002
"WE CLING TO ONE ANOTHER, THE STORM RAGING AROUND.

348
00:21:13,304 --> 00:21:17,308
MY HEAD SLIPS UNDER THE WATER, YOU CAN'T HEAR ME CRY.

349
00:21:17,341 --> 00:21:21,946
AND SO I LET GO, DRIFT AWAY, LEAVE YOUR COMFORT BEHIND.

350
00:21:23,981 --> 00:21:25,783
AND SAVE US."

351
00:21:30,654 --> 00:21:32,790
"LOVE ALWAYS, ASHLEY."
