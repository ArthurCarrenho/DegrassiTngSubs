00:00:20,394 --> 00:00:22,396
WHAT YOU LOOKIN' AT, FAG?

4
00:00:22,429 --> 00:00:23,497
WHAT?

5
00:00:24,298 --> 00:00:25,699
YOU CAN'T TAKE YOUR EYES OFF ME.

6
00:00:25,733 --> 00:00:27,301
YEAH, AS IF BUDDY.

7
00:00:27,334 --> 00:00:28,302
COME ON GUYS. LET'S PLAY.

8
00:00:28,335 --> 00:00:31,205
HEY JIMMY - HOW ABOUT YOUR TEAM BE SKINS NOW?

9
00:00:31,238 --> 00:00:33,841
OH, SO I GET IT. YOU JUST WANNA SEE ME TAKE MY SHIRT OFF.

10
00:00:33,874 --> 00:00:34,808
IS THAT IT?

11
00:00:36,110 --> 00:00:37,378
UH - NO.

12
00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:40,481
THERE. WHO'S THE MAN NOW?

13
00:00:40,514 --> 00:00:42,416
HEY, JUST DO THAT WHILE WE'RE ACTUALLY PLAYING.

14
00:00:42,449 --> 00:00:46,754
ALL RIGHT GIRLS, WE HAVING A GAME OR NOT?

15
00:00:50,224 --> 00:00:52,159
♪ Whatever it takes

16
00:00:53,527 --> 00:00:56,563
♪ I know I can make it through

17
00:00:58,899 --> 00:01:00,501
♪ If I hold out

18
00:01:02,736 --> 00:01:05,572
♪ I know I can make it through

19
00:01:10,744 --> 00:01:12,446
♪ Be the best

20
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:14,615
♪ The best that I can be

21
00:01:15,749 --> 00:01:18,285
♪ Hear what I say to you

22
00:01:18,919 --> 00:01:21,121
♪ Whatever it takes

23
00:01:22,689 --> 00:01:24,858
♪ I know I can make it

24
00:01:27,461 --> 00:01:30,297
♪ I know I can make it through

25
00:01:38,439 --> 00:01:40,474
YOU'RE SURE I LOOK OKAY?

26
00:01:40,507 --> 00:01:42,810
SINCE WHEN DO YOU CARE WHAT PEOPLE THINK ANYWAY?

27
00:01:42,843 --> 00:01:46,313
I DON'T REALLY. JUST... CERTAIN PEOPLE.

28
00:01:50,317 --> 00:01:54,221
WELL I THINK YOU LOOK GREAT. HIPPER THAN HIP.

29
00:01:54,254 --> 00:01:56,790
WHOA! HEY JIM! YEAH, WAIT UP!

30
00:01:57,458 --> 00:01:59,626
I'LL SEE YOU LATER?

31
00:02:02,496 --> 00:02:04,431
WHAT, NO KISS GOODBYE?

32
00:02:04,465 --> 00:02:07,768
I WISH. HE'S A GREAT FRIEND - BUT...

33
00:02:07,801 --> 00:02:09,870
BUT YOU WANT MORE, RIGHT?

34
00:02:13,207 --> 00:02:17,511
OKAY. BIG DAY FOR YOU GUYS. DR. SALLY IS BACK.

35
00:02:17,544 --> 00:02:18,912
WHO'S DR. SALLY.

36
00:02:18,946 --> 00:02:21,415
SEX, HEALTH EDUCATOR. VERY FRANK, VERY INFORMED.

37
00:02:21,448 --> 00:02:23,484
MR. S. -

38
00:02:23,917 --> 00:02:26,854
I'M ALL FOR THIS SEX TALK, OF COURSE.

39
00:02:26,887 --> 00:02:29,590
BUT DIDN'T WE DO THIS LAST YEAR.

40
00:02:29,623 --> 00:02:32,359
YOU DID BUT THERE IS ALWAYS MORE TO LEARN ABOUT.

41
00:02:32,392 --> 00:02:34,795
HEALTHY SEXUAL RELATIONS. SEXUAL IDENTITY,

42
00:02:34,828 --> 00:02:36,396
BEING GAY POSITIVE, YOU NAME IT.

43
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:38,732
YOU SURE HE DOESN'T MEAN HIV POSITIVE.

44
00:02:38,765 --> 00:02:40,267
GAVIN.

45
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:44,505
DEROGATORY JOKES ARE NOT ACCEPTABLE EVER.

46
00:02:44,538 --> 00:02:45,739
INTOLERANCE COMES FROM IGNORANCE.

47
00:02:45,772 --> 00:02:48,675
SO IT'S GOOD YOU'RE SEEING DR. SALLY IN HEALTH TODAY.

48
00:02:48,709 --> 00:02:51,411
HEY AH, SHE'S A VALUABLE RESOURCE.

49
00:02:51,445 --> 00:02:56,183
MAKE USE OF HER, OKAY? ASK HER THOSE BURNING QUESTIONS.

50
00:03:03,757 --> 00:03:06,460
NOW, IF YOU DO DECIDE TO HAVE SEX,

51
00:03:06,493 --> 00:03:10,297
THEN IT MUST BE CONDOMS, CONDOMS, CONDOMS.

52
00:03:12,699 --> 00:03:15,802
AND THAT KIND OF RESPECT IS KEY

53
00:03:15,836 --> 00:03:20,541
IN HETEROSEXUAL AND SAME-SEX RELATIONSHIPS.

54
00:03:20,574 --> 00:03:21,508
SAME SEX.

55
00:03:23,477 --> 00:03:24,778
IT MEANS TWO GUYS.

56
00:03:26,046 --> 00:03:29,850
GENTLEMEN, THE FLOOR'S YOURS. DON'T BE SHY.

57
00:03:33,554 --> 00:03:35,489
MOST GUYS - CHICKS TURN THEM ON.

58
00:03:35,522 --> 00:03:36,390
OH YEAH!

59
00:03:38,392 --> 00:03:39,726
OKAY, SO GAY GUYS -

60
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,662
HOW DOES SEEING ANOTHER GUY, UH, DO IT FOR THEM?

61
00:03:41,695 --> 00:03:45,632
THE SAME WAY AS SEEING AN ATTRACTIVE FEMALE

62
00:03:45,666 --> 00:03:47,467
DOES IT FOR STRAIGHT GUYS.

63
00:03:47,501 --> 00:03:49,736
MY OLDER BROTHER'S GAY

64
00:03:49,770 --> 00:03:53,040
AND HE'S KNOWN FOREVER - SAYS HE WAS BORN THAT WAY.

65
00:03:53,073 --> 00:03:56,577
WELL, THAT'S ONE THOUGHT - SOME PEOPLE THINK IT'S GENETIC.

66
00:03:56,610 --> 00:03:59,513
WOULDN'T THAT MEAN THAT GAY PARENTS HAVE GAY CHILDREN?

67
00:03:59,546 --> 00:04:03,717
WELL, IF A CHILD IS BORN WITH THE SO-CALLED "GAY GENE",

68
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:05,786
THEN YES IT'S POSSIBLE.

69
00:04:05,819 --> 00:04:07,688
SOME PEOPLE SAY IT'S A SIN.

70
00:04:07,721 --> 00:04:11,291
WHICH IS THE GREATER SIN? BEING YOURSELF?

71
00:04:11,325 --> 00:04:14,962
OR PRETENDING TO BE SOMEBODY YOU'RE NOT?

72
00:04:23,704 --> 00:04:26,440
NOW, SOMETIMES REFERRED TO SIMPLY AS THE PROCESSOR

73
00:04:26,473 --> 00:04:27,975
OR CENTRAL PROCESSOR,

74
00:04:28,008 --> 00:04:31,345
THE CPU IS WHERE MOST CALCULATIONS TAKE PLACE.

75
00:04:31,378 --> 00:04:33,614
IN ESSENCE IT'S THE BRAIN OF YOUR COMPUTER,

76
00:04:33,647 --> 00:04:35,582
THE PART YOUR COMPUTER USES TO THINK.

77
00:04:35,616 --> 00:04:38,018
IT PROCESSES DATA AND ANY INSTRUCTION YOU GIVE TO IT.

78
00:04:38,051 --> 00:04:39,953
EITHER DIRECTLY OR THROUGH A PROGRAM.

79
00:04:39,987 --> 00:04:41,922
WHAT IS HE DOING?

80
00:04:42,823 --> 00:04:44,491
I THINK ITS KIND OF CUTE.

81
00:04:44,524 --> 00:04:46,059
AND KIND OF OBSESSED.

82
00:04:46,093 --> 00:04:48,495
THIS RATE IS REFERRED TO AS THE CENTRAL PROCESSING SPEED.

83
00:04:48,528 --> 00:04:51,798
AND IT IS MEASURED IN MEGA-HERTZ.

84
00:04:58,138 --> 00:05:03,610
KENDRA TELL YOUR BOYFRIEND THAT CLASS TIME IS MY TIME, NOT HIS.

85
00:05:03,644 --> 00:05:04,945
SORRY MR. SIMPSON.

86
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:08,081
IN TERMS OF COMPUTER POWER THE CPU

87
00:05:08,115 --> 00:05:10,417
IS THE MOST IMPORTANT ELEMENT.

88
00:05:10,450 --> 00:05:11,618
THANK YOU, DR. SALLY.

89
00:05:11,652 --> 00:05:12,719
. YOU'RE WELCOME.

90
00:05:12,753 --> 00:05:14,488
EVERYBODY DON'T FORGET TO PICK UP YOUR SAMPLE PACKS

91
00:05:14,521 --> 00:05:15,622
ON THE WAY OUT.

92
00:05:15,656 --> 00:05:17,591
AND TO RECAP FOR MORE INFORMATION

93
00:05:17,624 --> 00:05:19,493
YOU CAN GO TO DR. SALLY'S WEB SITE,

94
00:05:19,526 --> 00:05:22,429
THE ADDRESS IS ON THE BOARD.

95
00:05:22,462 --> 00:05:24,598
AND EVERY WEDNESDAY NIGHT THERE IS

96
00:05:24,631 --> 00:05:28,001
A GAY, LESBIAN, BI, TRANSGENDER YOUTH MEETING

97
00:05:28,035 --> 00:05:32,539
AT THE COMMUNITY CENTER ON CHURCH. CHECK IT OUT.

98
00:05:34,541 --> 00:05:35,509
DR. SALLY, HEY.

99
00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:39,012
GO AHEAD I'VE HEARD EVERYTHING.

100
00:05:39,046 --> 00:05:40,881
IT'S ABOUT A BOY.

101
00:05:40,914 --> 00:05:44,851
I LIKE HIM, HE LIKES ME. AT LEAST, AS A FRIEND.

102
00:05:45,886 --> 00:05:46,720
BUT NOT...

103
00:05:48,455 --> 00:05:49,523
I DON'T KNOW.

104
00:05:50,524 --> 00:05:53,460
I TOLD HIM I LIKED HIM, BUT NOTHING'S HAPPENED.

105
00:05:53,493 --> 00:05:55,562
GUYS GET NERVOUS TOO.

106
00:05:55,595 --> 00:05:59,032
WHY DON'T YOU TALK TO HIM - BE BRAVE.

107
00:05:59,066 --> 00:06:01,601
TALK TO HIM SOME MORE.

108
00:06:12,713 --> 00:06:15,115
THERE YOU GO...

109
00:06:15,982 --> 00:06:18,118
HEY MARCY, DON'T FORGET YOUR FEMCARE!

110
00:06:18,151 --> 00:06:19,319
SHUT UP.

111
00:06:19,352 --> 00:06:22,589
WHAT DISTRACTED BY DR, SALLY'S ADVICE ON BOY-ON-BOY LOVE?

112
00:06:22,622 --> 00:06:24,658
SPINNER SHUT UP, OKAY?

113
00:06:25,559 --> 00:06:27,194
IT WAS A JOKE, DUDE.

114
00:06:27,227 --> 00:06:28,028
LOOK JUST TUNE HIM OUT.

115
00:06:28,061 --> 00:06:29,029
HE'S JUST TRYING TO GET YOU STARTED.

116
00:06:29,062 --> 00:06:31,598
I HATE FAGS OKAY. WHAT THEY DO, MAKES ME SICK.

117
00:06:31,631 --> 00:06:32,799
HEY, MARCO -

118
00:06:32,833 --> 00:06:35,836
SO JUST QUIT IT. I MEAN LIKE YESTERDAY, OKAY?

119
00:06:40,173 --> 00:06:41,942
YOUR EYES ARE SO BEAUTIFUL.

120
00:06:41,975 --> 00:06:45,712
THEY HAVE FLECKS OF GREEN, GOLD, NO... TOPAZ...

121
00:06:47,013 --> 00:06:47,914
REALLY?

122
00:06:47,948 --> 00:06:49,516
YEAH.

123
00:06:49,549 --> 00:06:51,218
UH HI, I'M STILL HERE.

124
00:06:51,251 --> 00:06:52,819
I'M TRYING TO EAT.

125
00:06:52,853 --> 00:06:55,589
SORRY. WE MUST BE PRETTY GROSS.

126
00:06:55,622 --> 00:06:56,823
UH, NOT SO MUCH.

127
00:07:00,894 --> 00:07:02,496
UGH, I'M SO LYING.

128
00:07:04,664 --> 00:07:05,532
SEE YOU GUYS.

129
00:07:10,904 --> 00:07:11,838
TOBY?

130
00:07:12,773 --> 00:07:15,142
MAYBE JT HAS A POINT.

131
00:07:15,175 --> 00:07:16,676
JT? A POINT?

132
00:07:17,911 --> 00:07:19,646
THAT'S A NEW ONE.

133
00:07:19,679 --> 00:07:21,648
SERIOUSLY. MAYBE WE SHOULD,

134
00:07:21,681 --> 00:07:24,117
YOU KNOW, COOL IT OR SOMETHING.

135
00:07:24,151 --> 00:07:25,152
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

136
00:07:25,185 --> 00:07:26,753
WHEN YOU BLEW KISSES AT ME IN SIMPSON'S CLASS?

137
00:07:26,787 --> 00:07:27,621
I GOT IN TROUBLE.

138
00:07:27,654 --> 00:07:28,755
YEAH ME TOO!

139
00:07:28,789 --> 00:07:32,659
KWAN DIDN'T THINK I NEEDED THAT MUCH BATHROOM TIME...

140
00:07:32,692 --> 00:07:34,995
I'VE WAS THINKING ABOUT YOUR ENGLISH TROUBLES.

141
00:07:35,028 --> 00:07:37,063
YOU'RE SWEET, TOBY - BUT I'M FINE.

142
00:07:37,097 --> 00:07:38,331
NO, I WANT TO HELP.

143
00:07:38,365 --> 00:07:41,268
SO I'VE SCHEDULED SOME TUTORING SESSIONS FOR THE TWO OF US.

144
00:07:41,301 --> 00:07:45,038
AND SOME STUDY BREAKS- TO BE TOGETHER.

145
00:07:45,071 --> 00:07:47,774
WEDNESDAY'S MY HOCKEY PRACTICE.

146
00:07:47,808 --> 00:07:48,675
DON'T WE THINK YOUR ENGLISH MARK'S

147
00:07:48,708 --> 00:07:50,911
ARE A LITTLE MORE IMPORTANT THAN THAT?

148
00:07:50,944 --> 00:07:54,481
NO, NO THEY'RE NOT. SO JUST PLEASE STOP.

149
00:08:02,189 --> 00:08:03,857
NOW, IF YOUR GROUP IS WATCHING CAREFULLY,

150
00:08:03,890 --> 00:08:06,660
YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO NOTE THE FILMMAKER'S TRICKS.

151
00:08:06,693 --> 00:08:08,795
PAY ATTENTION TO THE NARRATIVE AND VOICE-OVER TECHNIQUES.

152
00:08:08,829 --> 00:08:11,031
CONSIDER THE EDITING CHOICES.

153
00:08:11,064 --> 00:08:15,168
HOW IS MUSIC INFLUENCING THE FILMMAKERS POINT OF VIEW, OKAY?

154
00:08:15,202 --> 00:08:20,140
ALL PROJECTS ARE DUE ON FRIDAY. HAVE A GOOD ONE GUYS.

155
00:08:21,708 --> 00:08:24,778
GUYS, I'LL BE BACK IN A FEW MINUTES TO CLOSE UP SHOP, OKAY?

156
00:08:24,811 --> 00:08:27,547
UH YEAH. NO PROBLEM, MR. SIMPSON.

157
00:08:55,842 --> 00:08:57,310
HEY MARCO?

158
00:09:07,354 --> 00:09:10,223
ARE YOU WALKING HOME WITH US, OR NOT?

159
00:09:10,257 --> 00:09:11,324
NO - NO IT'S OKAY,

160
00:09:11,358 --> 00:09:13,927
I'LL JUST SEE YOU GUYS TOMORROW.

161
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:14,561
OKAY.

162
00:09:25,238 --> 00:09:26,973
BUT I LIKE THE SOUR KEYS.

163
00:09:27,007 --> 00:09:27,941
SURE, THEY'RE GOOD.

164
00:09:27,974 --> 00:09:31,311
BUT THERE'S A WHOLE GUMMY WORLD TO EXPLORE.

165
00:09:31,344 --> 00:09:32,679
HERE.

166
00:09:35,415 --> 00:09:36,616
MARCO?

167
00:09:38,051 --> 00:09:39,052
SORRY, WHAT?

168
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:43,223
IT'S NOT SO EASY FOR ME TO ASK.

169
00:09:44,257 --> 00:09:45,926
I'M LISTENING. I AM.

170
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:47,160
OKAY.

171
00:09:49,195 --> 00:09:51,364
WELL, ARE WE JUST FRIENDS?

172
00:09:56,403 --> 00:09:58,605
ELLIE I LIKE YOU. A LOT.

173
00:10:00,407 --> 00:10:02,742
AND I MEAN YOU LIKE ME TOO, RIGHT?

SO LET'S GO OUT. LIKE ON A REAL DATE.

175
00:10:06,413 --> 00:10:07,914
YOU'RE SERIOUS?

00:10:07,948 --> 00:10:09,616
YEAH. TOTALLY.

177
00:11:04,437 --> 00:11:07,073
OUR MEDIA IMMERSION GROUP IS MEETING AT MY HOUSE AT SEVEN, OKAY?

178
00:11:07,107 --> 00:11:10,110

179
00:11:10,143 --> 00:11:11,911
WEIRD HAVING JIMMY OVER AGAIN.

180
00:11:11,945 --> 00:11:14,681
WELL, HE'S IN OUR GROUP...

181
00:11:15,348 --> 00:11:17,183
HEY EL! WAIT UP!

182
00:11:17,984 --> 00:11:19,819
CAN I MEET YOU INSIDE?

183
00:11:19,853 --> 00:11:21,488
EL, HOLD ON.

184
00:11:21,521 --> 00:11:24,024
PLEASE DON'T MAKE THIS INTO SOME CHEESY GIRL-TALK SCENE.

185
00:11:24,057 --> 00:11:25,325
I'M FINE.

186
00:11:26,459 --> 00:11:29,462
OKAY. LET ME GUESS. BAD DATE?

187
00:11:29,496 --> 00:11:31,765
NO. I HAD FUN.

188
00:11:31,798 --> 00:11:34,334
I ALWAYS HAVE FUN WITH MARCO.

189
00:11:34,367 --> 00:11:36,403
BUT - THAT WAS ALL.

190
00:11:36,436 --> 00:11:39,706
OH. NO KISS? NOT EVEN GOODNIGHT?

191
00:11:40,473 --> 00:11:44,010
MAYBE HE DOESN'T LIKE ME THAT WAY.

192
00:11:45,512 --> 00:11:48,982
OR - MAYBE HE DOESN'T LIKE GIRLS.

193
00:11:52,919 --> 00:11:55,288
FROM SPINNER, I'D EXPECT THAT.

194
00:11:55,321 --> 00:11:56,956
BUT FROM YOU?

195
00:11:56,990 --> 00:11:58,391
DISAPPOINTING.

196
00:11:58,425 --> 00:11:59,292
I'M JUST CONCERNED.

197
00:11:59,325 --> 00:12:00,460
BECAUSE...?

198
00:12:01,561 --> 00:12:04,097
WHAT MY FAMILY WENT THROUGH BEFORE MY DAD CAME OUT?

199
00:12:04,130 --> 00:12:04,798
NOT FUN.

200
00:12:05,665 --> 00:12:08,234
AND NOT RELEVANT. MARCO'S STRAIGHT.

201
00:12:13,239 --> 00:12:15,075
SOMEONE'S IN LOVE.

202
00:12:15,108 --> 00:12:18,078
YEAH. BUT I THINK SHE'S MAD AT ME.

203
00:12:18,111 --> 00:12:21,314
AND SO YOU'RE DOING THIS - FOR HER?

204
00:12:22,148 --> 00:12:23,149
BIG MISTAKE.

205
00:12:24,150 --> 00:12:27,353
TRUST ME TOBY, IT'LL MAKE HER FEEL SMOTHERED.

206
00:12:27,387 --> 00:12:28,354
SMOTHERED? NO.

207
00:12:29,422 --> 00:12:31,825
IT'LL SHOW HER I CARE.

208
00:12:31,858 --> 00:12:33,326
TOBY?

209
00:12:37,397 --> 00:12:39,199
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

210
00:12:41,401 --> 00:12:42,268
FOR YOU.

211
00:12:44,404 --> 00:12:45,205
THANKS.

212
00:13:01,387 --> 00:13:02,355
TOLD YA.

213
00:13:09,028 --> 00:13:12,232
HEY MARCY, AREN'T YOU IN THE WRONG CHANGEROOM?

214
00:13:12,265 --> 00:13:13,600
SHUT UP, IDIOT.

215
00:13:13,633 --> 00:13:15,168
YOU'RE GOOD FOR ONE JOKE A YEAR.

216
00:13:15,201 --> 00:13:17,537
AND YOU REPEAT IT OVER AND OVER AND OVER...

217
00:13:17,570 --> 00:13:19,973
NO, I DON'T CARE HOW MANY JOKES THIS GUY MAKES.

218
00:13:20,006 --> 00:13:23,343
BECAUSE I'M THE ONE WITH THE GIRLFRIEND.

219
00:13:23,977 --> 00:13:25,512
SERIOUS? WHO?

220
00:13:26,312 --> 00:13:27,280
ELLIE.

221
00:13:29,616 --> 00:13:31,351
ELLIE IS YOUR FRIEND, WHO'S A GIRL,

222
00:13:31,384 --> 00:13:33,153
BUT SHE IS NOT YOUR GIRLFRIEND.

223
00:13:33,186 --> 00:13:34,454
THEY'RE DIFFERENT THINGS.

224
00:13:34,487 --> 00:13:37,490
WELL, NOT AFTER LAST NIGHT.

225
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:42,228
OKAY, DEL ROSSI. DETAILS.

226
00:13:43,596 --> 00:13:46,332
BURGERS, MOVIE, LONG WALK HOME...

227
00:13:48,034 --> 00:13:52,038
HOW FAR DID YOU GET? THIRD BASE? SECOND BASE?

228
00:13:52,071 --> 00:13:53,039
DID YOU MAKE OUT?

229
00:13:53,072 --> 00:13:54,474
YEAH. THE LAST ONE.

230
00:13:56,075 --> 00:13:59,546
WE LIKE KISSED - FOR, LIKE, FOREVER.

231
00:14:02,682 --> 00:14:06,152
AND YOU'RE A BAD LIAR. LOSER.

232
00:14:16,596 --> 00:14:18,498
I WANT EACH OF YOU TO WRITE A TWO PAGE ESSAY

233
00:14:18,531 --> 00:14:20,667
ABOUT YOUR DREAM CAREER.

234
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:22,635
DON'T WORRY ABOUT BEING PRACTICAL.

235
00:14:22,669 --> 00:14:25,305
THIS EXERCISE IS ABOUT HOPES NOT FEARS.

236
00:14:25,338 --> 00:14:28,174
MY FEAR IS THAT KENDRA HATES ME.

237
00:14:28,208 --> 00:14:30,043
MY HOPE IS THAT I DIE.

238
00:14:31,444 --> 00:14:32,412
GIMME A BREAK.

239
00:14:33,379 --> 00:14:35,315
I THINK SHE WANTS TO DUMP ME.

240
00:14:35,348 --> 00:14:38,318
WHAT DID I SAY ABOUT TALKING?

241
00:14:38,351 --> 00:14:39,586
SORRY SIR.

242
00:14:39,619 --> 00:14:40,987
CAN I BE EXCUSED?

243
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:43,423
NO. YOU CAN START THE EXERCISE.

244
00:14:52,432 --> 00:14:54,133
HEY, IT'S MARCO'S GIRLFRIEND.

245
00:14:54,167 --> 00:14:56,336
OR IS IT HIS WIFE? I REALLY CAN'T KEEP UP.

246
00:14:56,369 --> 00:14:58,905
JUST A MINUTE, GUYS.

247
00:15:00,473 --> 00:15:01,374
HEY, ELLIE.

248
00:15:01,407 --> 00:15:01,941
HEY.

249
00:15:03,576 --> 00:15:05,445
I HAD A REALLY GREAT TIME LAST NIGHT.

250
00:15:05,478 --> 00:15:07,247
YEAH, ME TOO.

251
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:09,949
BUT, I SORTA FORGOT SOMETHING...

252
00:15:13,319 --> 00:15:13,620
MARCO!

253
00:15:18,458 --> 00:15:21,261
THEY'RE WAITING. SEE YOU LATER?

254
00:15:26,165 --> 00:15:28,434
GO MARCO.

255
00:15:28,468 --> 00:15:32,071
THINGS ARE LOOKING UP FOR YOU, BUDDY.

256
00:15:34,674 --> 00:15:36,576
THAT PLAY WAS AMAZING.

257
00:15:36,609 --> 00:15:39,379
I MEAN IT WAS LIKE THE BALL WAS WAITING FOR ME TO KICK IT.

258
00:15:39,412 --> 00:15:40,280
SO COOL.

259
00:15:41,581 --> 00:15:42,115
HEY.

260
00:15:45,652 --> 00:15:46,586
TOBY?

261
00:15:48,354 --> 00:15:49,088
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

262
00:15:49,122 --> 00:15:49,756
WHAT DO YOU CARE?

263
00:15:49,789 --> 00:15:50,723
OH COME ON -

264
00:15:50,757 --> 00:15:52,759
NO. YOU DON'T LIKE ME. I'M SMOTHERING YOU.

265
00:15:52,792 --> 00:15:54,527
I NEVER SAID THAT.

266
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:56,362
YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO.

267
00:16:12,145 --> 00:16:13,212
WHAT'S THAT?

268
00:16:13,246 --> 00:16:15,181
GO BACK TO SLEEP, SPIN.

269
00:16:19,118 --> 00:16:22,588
SHOT ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY-SIX OF A RODENT... SAVE ME.

270
00:16:22,622 --> 00:16:24,023
PIZZA'S HERE.

271
00:16:24,057 --> 00:16:25,224
SAVED!

272
00:16:31,197 --> 00:16:32,732
UH GUYS, LADIES FIRST, HUH?

273
00:16:32,765 --> 00:16:35,501
OH WELL THEN, AFTER YOU MARCO.

274
00:16:36,569 --> 00:16:39,138
AW, DID WE OFFEND ELLIE?

275
00:16:39,172 --> 00:16:40,273
GEE, YOU THINK?

276
00:16:40,306 --> 00:16:44,744
DON'T FLATTER YOURSELVES. I'M GOING TO THE BATHROOM.

277
00:16:53,419 --> 00:16:55,388
UH - I'M JUST GONNA GET SOME WATER.

278
00:16:55,421 --> 00:16:56,489
OH, I'LL GET IT.

279
00:16:56,522 --> 00:16:58,591
NO, IT'S OKAY. I CAN GET IT.

280
00:17:01,861 --> 00:17:05,231
I DIDN'T KNOW MY KITCHEN WAS UPSTAIRS.

281
00:17:12,705 --> 00:17:15,074
YOU WANTED TO TALK?

282
00:17:17,610 --> 00:17:18,611
SORRY.

283
00:17:19,479 --> 00:17:21,347
NO, THAT WAS GREAT.

284
00:17:41,367 --> 00:17:45,204
YOU'RE SHAKING. SHOULD WE GO DOWNSTAIRS?

285
00:17:45,605 --> 00:17:48,141
NO. I WANT TO BE HERE.

286
00:17:55,882 --> 00:17:58,351
COULD HAVE FOOLED ME.

287
00:18:01,754 --> 00:18:04,490
ELLIE I LIKE YOU. AND I WANT TO KISS YOU.

288
00:18:04,524 --> 00:18:06,325
THEN KISS ME.

289
00:18:11,197 --> 00:18:13,266
AM I DOING SOMETHING WRONG?

290
00:18:13,299 --> 00:18:14,901
NO, EL, YOU'RE PERFECT.

291
00:18:14,934 --> 00:18:17,136
BUT YOU DON'T THINK I'M ATTRACTIVE.

292
00:18:17,170 --> 00:18:17,703
YOU'RE BEAUTIFUL.

293
00:18:17,737 --> 00:18:19,472
THAT'S NOT WHAT I MEAN.

294
00:18:19,505 --> 00:18:21,441
DO YOU THINK I'M - HOT?

295
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:29,382
IT'S A SIMPLE QUESTION.

296
00:18:35,888 --> 00:18:38,357
DO YOU LIKE GIRLS - AT ALL?

297
00:18:47,467 --> 00:18:48,901
ELLIE I WANT TO.

298
00:18:48,935 --> 00:18:51,504
AND I WANT YOU TO SO MUCH.

299
00:18:51,537 --> 00:18:53,139
BUT IF YOU CAN'T...

300
00:18:54,507 --> 00:18:57,777
IT'S NOT FAIR TO LEAVE ME HANGING.

301
00:18:57,810 --> 00:19:00,546
PLEASE. PLEASE WOULD YOU TELL ME?

302
00:19:01,714 --> 00:19:03,249
ELLIE I DON'T KNOW. ELLIE-

303
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:09,355
I'M JUST - I'M TRYING.

304
00:19:13,659 --> 00:19:16,262
I AM... I'M JUST SO CONFUSED...

305
00:19:31,644 --> 00:19:33,579
I THINK MAYBE YOU'RE OVER-REACTING.

306
00:19:33,613 --> 00:19:34,814
WHAT WAS I THINKING?

307
00:19:34,847 --> 00:19:37,683
ME, TOBY ISAACS, WITH A GIRLFRIEND.

308
00:19:37,717 --> 00:19:39,519
AS IF A GIRL WOULD EVER LIKE ME.

309
00:19:39,552 --> 00:19:41,988
HARD TO BELIEVE I KNOW. BUT KENDRA DOES.

310
00:19:42,021 --> 00:19:43,055
KENDRA DOESN'T.

311
00:19:43,089 --> 00:19:46,692
KENDRA SPEAKS FOR HERSELF, THANKS.

312
00:19:46,726 --> 00:19:49,262
JUST GO AHEAD. GO AHEAD. BREAK UP WITH ME.

313
00:19:49,295 --> 00:19:52,231
OH, IS THAT WHY I'M HERE?

314
00:19:52,265 --> 00:19:53,599
TOBY, I LIKE YOU -

315
00:19:53,633 --> 00:19:54,934
BUT JUST AS FRIENDS.

316
00:19:54,967 --> 00:19:57,003
THAT'S EXACTLY IT, RIGHT THERE.

317
00:19:57,036 --> 00:19:57,537
WHAT?

318
00:19:57,570 --> 00:19:59,405
YOU, ANSWERING FOR ME.

319
00:19:59,438 --> 00:20:01,841
JUST - BEING THERE, CONSTANTLY.

320
00:20:01,874 --> 00:20:05,244
YOU CAN'T STAND BEING AROUND ME.

321
00:20:06,879 --> 00:20:11,684
I LOVE BEING AROUND YOU. JUST - NOT ALL THE TIME, OKAY?

322
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:22,261
MARCO DEL STUDLY.

323
00:20:22,295 --> 00:20:26,399
NOW OFFICIALLY, MARCO WAS GETTING A "GLASS OF WATER", OF COURSE.

324
00:20:26,432 --> 00:20:31,571
OF COURSE. AND HOW DID THAT GLASS OF WATER TASTE? SWEET?

325
00:20:31,604 --> 00:20:32,972
LIKE SUGAR MAN.

326
00:20:33,005 --> 00:20:35,575
YOU GUYS CAN BE OFFICIALLY JEALOUS OF ME NOW.

327
00:20:35,608 --> 00:20:36,976
JEALOUS OF WHAT?

328
00:20:37,009 --> 00:20:42,648
OF YOU TWO, AND YOUR EXTENDED BATHROOM BREAK FRIDAY NIGHT.

329
00:20:44,483 --> 00:20:46,786
YOU SHOULD BE TOTALLY JEALOUS.

330
00:20:51,657 --> 00:20:53,326
SWEET.

331
00:20:56,629 --> 00:20:57,530
EL -

332
00:20:57,563 --> 00:20:58,664
YOU'RE WELCOME.

333
00:20:58,698 --> 00:21:01,734
BUT I CAN'T PRETEND FOREVER.

334
00:21:02,668 --> 00:21:04,737
YOU CAN'T EITHER.

335
00:21:04,770 --> 00:21:05,638
I KNOW.

336
00:21:06,872 --> 00:21:08,708
I WAS THINKING.

337
00:21:08,741 --> 00:21:12,745
THAT GAY YOUTH GROUP, MR. ARMSTRONG MENTIONED.

338
00:21:12,778 --> 00:21:14,747
IF YOU EVER WANTED TO GO CHECK IT OUT I COULD COME WITH.

339
00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:15,281
ELLIE-

340
00:21:16,582 --> 00:21:17,750
SORRY.

341
00:21:18,384 --> 00:21:20,720
NO. THANK YOU.

342
00:21:20,753 --> 00:21:21,821
REALLY.

343
00:21:22,922 --> 00:21:26,359
IT'S JUST THAT I'M NOT READY FOR THAT YET. OKAY?

344
00:21:28,628 --> 00:21:30,696
WHEN YOU ARE, I'M THERE.
