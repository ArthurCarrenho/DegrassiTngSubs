YOU'LL BE FINE.

55

00:02:36,266 --> 00:02:38,068
IF YOU WANT, YOU CAN INVITE SOME OF YOUR BUDS OVER,

00:02:38,102 --> 00:02:38,936
THAT'S COOL.

00:02:38,969 --> 00:02:41,939
BUT, THREE GROUND RULES -

00:02:51,281 --> 00:02:53,784
MY DAD'S BEEN WORKING ON KID ELRICK TIX ALL WEEK.

65
00:02:53,817 --> 00:02:55,819

67
00:02:58,489 --> 00:02:59,390
WELL, HOW ABOUT YOU MARCO?

68
00:02:59,423 --> 00:03:03,160
I MEAN, YOUR MOM WORKS IN THE MUSIC BIZ.

69
00:03:03,193 --> 00:03:05,262
SHE TEACHES PIANO, SPINNER.

70
00:03:07,931 --> 00:03:08,465
WHO DIED?

71
00:03:09,333 --> 00:03:11,835

00:03:11,869 --> 00:03:13,737

OH, YOU INVITED HIM.

80
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:32,189
I'LL TAKE A PASS.

81
00:03:32,222 --> 00:03:33,957
WELL, I CAN'T UNINVITE HIM NOW.

82
00:03:33,991 --> 00:03:35,025

87
00:03:44,835 --> 00:03:46,236
NO PARTIES, SPIN.

00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:46,603
GIRLS?

89
00:03:46,637 --> 00:03:47,304
NO GIRLS.

90
00:03:47,337 --> 00:03:47,938
BOOZE?

91
00:03:47,971 --> 00:03:48,839

00:03:54,311 --> 00:03:54,445
YES!

97
00:03:59,349 --> 00:04:01,218
DID YOU KNOW THERE'S NO WORD IN THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE

98
00:04:01,251 --> 00:04:03,454
THAT RHYMES WITH ORANGE?

99
00:04:03,487 --> 00:04:06,557
DID YOU KNOW IT'S FRIDAY? THE WEEKEND.

100
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:09,293
SURE DO. I THOUGHT TONIGHT WE'D GO SEE THAT NEW MOVIE

101
00:04:09,326 --> 00:04:10,794
"STRANGE EVIL."

102
00:04:11,962 --> 00:04:13,864
THE REVIEWERS SAID IT WAS 'EDGY'.

103
00:04:13,897 --> 00:04:17,901
LAME. BESIDES, I'M GETTING MY CARTILAGE PIERCED.

104
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:23,974
HEY, ELLIE,

105
00:04:25,042 --> 00:04:27,411
DO YOU THINK I SHOULD GET MY BELLY BUTTON PIERCED?

106
00:04:27,444 --> 00:04:29,179
I'VE WANTED TO FOR A WHILE.

107
00:04:29,213 --> 00:04:32,015

108
00:04:32,049 --> 00:04:33,083
AFTER SCHOOL?

109
00:04:33,117 --> 00:04:36,086
HE'D BE ABLE TO SQUEEZE ME IN ON SUCH SHORT NOTICE?

110
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,187
LET'S FIND OUT.

111
00:04:41,158 --> 00:04:44,928
AS YOU SHOULD ALL KNOW BY NOW A SIMILE IS A COMPARISON

112
00:04:44,962 --> 00:04:46,497
USING 'LIKE' OR 'AS'.

113
00:04:47,197 --> 00:04:50,234
WHILE A METAPHOR IS A FIGURE OF SPEECH

114
00:04:50,267 --> 00:04:51,201
IN WHICH THINGS ARE COMPARED

115
00:04:51,235 --> 00:04:55,239
BY STATING THAT ONE THING IS ANOTHER.

116
00:04:55,272 --> 00:04:59,143
BOTH SIMILES AND METAPHORS ARE USED IN POETRY.

117
00:04:59,176 --> 00:05:01,879
AND WE'RE GOING TO LOOK AT THEM TODAY.

118
00:05:01,912 --> 00:05:04,081
SO, THE DAY IS DONE.

119
00:05:06,283 --> 00:05:10,354
AND THE DARKNESS FALLS ON THE WINGS OF NIGHT.

120

SO ATTILA, IS THAT THE SAME KIND OF NEEDLE

144

00:06:55,993 --> 00:06:57,394
NO, NO.

146
00:06:57,427 --> 00:07:00,430
I'LL BE USING A MUCH LARGER ONE.

147
00:07:00,464 --> 00:07:01,298

00:09:00,784 --> 00:09:02,452
YOU DO IT LIKE THIS.

186
00:09:06,390 --> 00:09:08,325
AH, COME ON MAN.

187
00:09:08,859 --> 00:09:10,594
WHAT? YOU GUYS, WHAT?

188
00:09:13,897 --> 00:09:19,569
I WAS THINKING ABOUT GETTING MY BELLY BUTTON PIERCED.

189
00:09:23,173 --> 00:09:24,341
SEE, TOLD YOU.

190
00:09:25,342 --> 00:09:28,211
TOLD ELLIE WHAT? I JUST REACTED.

191
00:09:28,678 --> 00:09:31,281
RIGHT. YOU MADE A TOTAL FACE.

192
00:09:32,382 --> 00:09:35,786
DO YOU WANT MY PERMISSION OR NOT, ASHLEY?

193
00:09:41,391 --> 00:09:45,328
NOW YOU JUST HAVE TO CLEAN IT SCRUPULOUSLY. FOR WEEKS.

194
00:09:45,362 --> 00:09:46,863
BUT IT'S WORTH IT.

195
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:52,636
IF ONLY I WERE TEN YEARS YOUNGER.

196
00:10:00,544 --> 00:10:03,146
SPIN-NER! SPIN-NER! SPIN-NER!

197
00:10:05,649 --> 00:10:07,584
YES! KING OF THE WORLD.

198
00:10:08,819 --> 00:10:11,288
OKAY - WHO'S NEXT? I DARE YOU GUYS!

199
00:10:11,321 --> 00:10:14,357
FORGET IT. OH, NO THANKS... I'M UH -

00:10:14,391 --> 00:10:16,793
LOOK, COME ON. YOU GUYS SUCK.

201
00:10:18,695 --> 00:10:20,697
OH! WAIT. I HAVE A DARE.

202
00:10:25,268 --> 00:10:26,903
UH-OH. BATHROOM BREAK.

203
00:10:31,741 --> 00:10:34,311
WHAT, THIS IS YOUR DARE? A PRANK PHONE CALL?

204
00:10:34,344 --> 00:10:37,547
WHAT? YOU SCARED OF TALKING TO A STRANGER?

205
00:10:38,548 --> 00:10:41,418
HELLO, THIS IS THE POWER COMPANY.

206
00:10:41,451 --> 00:10:43,353
SO THIS IS WHAT YOU DO FOR FUN, SEAN?

207
00:10:43,386 --> 00:10:45,789
PRANK YOUR EX-GIRLFRIEND?

208
00:10:51,394 --> 00:10:54,397
YOU'RE DEAD, PHONE-BOY! YOU'RE DEAD.

209
00:11:08,945 --> 00:11:10,881
YEAH. THIS IS THE LIFE.

210
00:11:13,984 --> 00:11:16,586
YOU KNOW WHAT? I LIKE YOU GUYS.

211
00:11:19,589 --> 00:11:21,224
WHAT, ARE YOU GONNA KISS US NOW?

212
00:11:21,258 --> 00:11:22,459
SHUT UP, SEAN.

213
00:11:22,492 --> 00:11:24,594
NO, I MEAN WITH MY DAD -

214
00:11:24,628 --> 00:11:27,397
HE WOULD'VE NEVER LET ME HAVE YOU ALL OVER LIKE THIS.

215
00:11:27,430 --> 00:11:31,368
NO. WELL, A LOT DIFFERENT HERE, I SUPPOSE, HUH?

216
00:11:31,401 --> 00:11:32,369
YEAH, TOTALLY.

217
00:11:34,004 --> 00:11:37,340
WITH JOEY - IT'S LIKE I CAN DO NO WRONG.

218
00:11:39,509 --> 00:11:42,879
I GET TOTAL, ONE-HUNDRED PERCENT FREEDOM.

219
00:11:42,913 --> 00:11:45,315
I MEAN, HE EVEN LET ME DRIVE.

220
00:11:47,984 --> 00:11:49,352
UM, YOU DROVE?

221
00:11:51,621 --> 00:11:52,389
UH, IT WAS NO BIG THING.

222
00:11:52,422 --> 00:11:55,225
JUST SOME CLUNKER AT THE CAR LOT.

223
00:11:58,295 --> 00:12:00,363
MAN, IT WAS A HUGE THING.

224
00:12:00,664 --> 00:12:02,566
IT WAS THE COOLEST THING I'VE EVER DONE.

225
00:12:02,599 --> 00:12:06,336
THAT'S SWEET. WINDOWS DOWN. TUNES PUMPING.

226
00:12:06,369 --> 00:12:08,972
I'D GIVE ANYTHING FOR THAT!

227
00:12:09,005 --> 00:12:11,408
IT WAS JUST ACROSS THE LOT.

228
00:12:11,441 --> 00:12:13,376
SO? AND I BET YOU KNOW WHERE JOEY KEEPS THE KEYS

229
00:12:13,410 --> 00:12:14,711
TO HIS DEALERSHIP.

230
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:19,049
MAN. YEAH, LET'S GO TAKE IT OUT FOR A TEST DRIVE.

231
00:12:19,082 --> 00:12:20,584
YOU KNOW, JUST AROUND THE BLOCK.

232
00:12:20,617 --> 00:12:22,519
WHAT? ON THE ROAD?

233
00:12:22,552 --> 00:12:24,487
NO, WE'D SO GET CAUGHT.

234
00:12:28,425 --> 00:12:31,361
WELL, WHAT ABOUT TOMORROW? WANT TO?

235
00:12:45,075 --> 00:12:46,776
IT'S A GORGEOUS SATURDAY MORNING.

236
00:12:46,810 --> 00:12:49,446
85 DEGREES AND NOT A CLOUD IN THE SKY.

237
00:12:49,479 --> 00:12:51,548
I TELL YOU, I'M JEALOUS OF CARLA COLLINS.

238
00:12:51,581 --> 00:12:52,415
SHE'LL BE OUT CRUISIN' IN THE MIX MOBILE...

239
00:12:52,449 --> 00:12:52,782
HEY.

240
00:12:55,118 --> 00:12:57,354
STILL GOING FOR THAT RIDE TODAY?

241
00:12:57,387 --> 00:12:59,022
SURE, BUT MAYBE LATER.

242
00:13:01,358 --> 00:13:02,258
LATER?

243
00:13:02,292 --> 00:13:05,528
CRAIG, YOU'RE NOT CHICKENING OUT ARE YOU?

244
00:13:29,419 --> 00:13:30,820
RIGHT HERE.

245
00:13:32,856 --> 00:13:34,057
KEYS TO THE KINGDOM.

246
00:13:34,090 --> 00:13:34,758
(Telephone Ringing)

247
00:13:34,791 --> 00:13:35,425
ARRR!

248
00:13:35,458 --> 00:13:35,725

249
00:13:35,759 --> 00:13:36,326
ARRR!

250
00:13:38,595 --> 00:13:40,096
DUDE, YOU GAVE ME A HEART ATTACK.

251
00:13:40,130 --> 00:13:41,331
SORRY.

252
00:13:45,402 --> 00:13:46,703
WHAT DO I DO?

253
00:13:46,736 --> 00:13:47,737
ANSWER IT.

254
00:13:47,771 --> 00:13:51,775
NO, YOU IDIOT - WE'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO BE HERE.

255
00:13:51,808 --> 00:13:53,076
LET'S GO.

256
00:13:56,012 --> 00:13:58,915
WHY ARE WE TAKING THIS ANYWAY? IT'S JUNK.

257
00:13:58,948 --> 00:14:01,951
BECAUSE I'VE DRIVEN IT BEFORE - I KNOW HOW TO DRIVE IT.

258
00:14:01,985 --> 00:14:03,987
LISTEN GUYS, MAYBE THIS ISN'T THE GREATEST IDEA.

259
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:04,854
COME ON, WE'RE JUST GOING TO TAKE IT

260
00:14:04,888 --> 00:14:07,657
AROUND THE BLOCK A COUPLE OF TIMES.

261
00:14:11,127 --> 00:14:12,962
GENTLEMEN? LET'S ROLL.

262
00:14:20,904 --> 00:14:23,373
UH, SHORT RIDE, DUDE.

263
00:14:28,678 --> 00:14:31,681
YEAH! ALRIGHT! YEAH, LET'S GO!

264
00:14:47,997 --> 00:14:49,032
HEY, GIRLS.

265
00:14:49,065 --> 00:14:50,066
OFF TO YOUR PIERCING?

266
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:53,903
YEP. WANNA COME? YOU COULD GET ONE TOO.

267
00:14:53,937 --> 00:14:56,706
NO THANKS. NONE FOR ME PLEASE.

268
00:14:56,740 --> 00:14:59,576
I'M NOT AS BRAVE AS YOU TWO.

269
00:15:10,487 --> 00:15:14,224
WHOA. SLOW DOWN THERE. IT'S GETTING SCARY HERE.

270
00:15:14,257 --> 00:15:16,092
KEEP TALKING, SPINNER.

271
00:15:16,126 --> 00:15:19,028
YOUR IDEA OF A GOOD TIME IS SPRAY CHEESE.

272
00:15:19,062 --> 00:15:20,830
AND THAT WAS THE LATEST FROM PARTY DIVISION.

273
00:15:20,864 --> 00:15:22,599
NOW WE TAKE YOU LIVE TO CARLA COLLINS.

274
00:15:22,632 --> 00:15:23,633
SO HOW DO YOU GET TICKETS

275
00:15:23,666 --> 00:15:26,102

276
00:15:26,136 --> 00:15:27,637

277
00:15:27,670 --> 00:15:30,807
JUST COME DOWN TO MELDRUM PARK AND FIND ME IN THE MIX-MOBILE.

278
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:32,108

279
00:15:32,142 --> 00:15:36,179

280
00:15:36,212 --> 00:15:37,180
WOW!

00:15:37,213 --> 00:15:38,281
PULL OVER.

282
00:15:38,314 --> 00:15:39,916
MELDRUM PARK'S ONLY TEN MINUTES AWAY IF WE RUN FAST.

283
00:15:39,949 --> 00:15:41,818
WHO'S RUNNING? WE'RE DRIVING.

284
00:15:41,851 --> 00:15:44,654
YEAH, IN TEN MINUTES THAT PARK'LL BE FULL OF PEOPLE.

285
00:15:44,687 --> 00:15:46,756
WE SAID WE WERE DRIVING AROUND THE BLOCK AND THAT'S IT.

286
00:15:46,790 --> 00:15:48,224
YEAH, THAT WAS BEFORE THE CONTEST.

287
00:15:48,258 --> 00:15:50,093
I SAY WE TAKE THE CAR.

288
00:15:50,126 --> 00:15:51,494
YEAH, I'M DOWN WITH THAT.

289
00:15:51,528 --> 00:15:52,295
GUYS, NO.

290
00:15:52,328 --> 00:15:54,130
OKAY, IT'S TWO FOR, ONE AGAINST.

291
00:15:54,164 --> 00:15:57,500
DECIDING VOTE TO CRAIG. WHAT DO YOU SAY?

292
00:16:05,809 --> 00:16:07,143
YEAH! WOW!

293
00:16:10,947 --> 00:16:12,015
I'M GOING TO PIERCE HERE.

294
00:16:12,048 --> 00:16:16,219
AND FEED IT THROUGH UNTIL IT COMES OUT THERE.

295
00:16:16,252 --> 00:16:18,621
THIS IS THE CLAMP I'M GOING TO USE TO HOLD YOUR SKIN

296
00:16:18,655 --> 00:16:21,057
WHEN I DO THE PIERCING, OKAY?

297
00:16:23,126 --> 00:16:24,828
THIS IS AN ANTISEPTIC GEL.

298
00:16:24,861 --> 00:16:28,131
IT'S GOING TO FEEL A LITTLE COOL.

299
00:16:32,235 --> 00:16:35,839
NOW I'M MARKING THE POINT OF ENTRY.

300
00:16:41,044 --> 00:16:45,114
ASHLEY, YOU'RE GOING TO FEEL A LITTLE PRESSURE NOW.

301
00:16:47,283 --> 00:16:49,552
I'M SORRY! I CAN'T DO IT!

302
00:16:49,586 --> 00:16:50,653
I DON'T CARE HOW COOL IT'LL LOOK.

303
00:16:50,687 --> 00:16:53,623
THAT THING IS NOT PIERCING MY BODY!

304
00:16:56,793 --> 00:16:59,229
ALRIGHT NOW. HERE'S THE SKILL TESTING QUESTION.

305
00:16:59,262 --> 00:17:01,197
NAME KID ELRICK'S WIFE.

306
00:17:05,235 --> 00:17:07,303
YOU HAVE NO CLUE DO YOU?

307
00:17:07,337 --> 00:17:09,105
NO.

308
00:17:09,138 --> 00:17:10,640
THAT'S OKAY.

309
00:17:11,207 --> 00:17:11,808
WE'RE HERE FOR THE CONTEST.

310
00:17:11,841 --> 00:17:14,777
OKAY, TAKE A BREATH, CHAMP.

00:17:14,811 --> 00:17:16,112
TELL US YOUR NAME FIRST.

00:17:16,145 --> 00:17:17,213
MY NAME'S CRAIG.

313
00:17:17,247 --> 00:17:18,681
OKAY, CRAIG.

314
00:17:18,715 --> 00:17:21,885
NOW, TELL ME THE NAME OF KID ELRICK'S WIFE.

315
00:17:23,686 --> 00:17:27,757
THAT'S A TRICK QUESTION, 'CAUSE KID ELRICK'S DIVORCED.

316
00:17:27,790 --> 00:17:28,625
WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT?

317
00:17:28,658 --> 00:17:30,093
YOU CAN GIVE MY BEST TO THE KID TONIGHT,

318
00:17:30,126 --> 00:17:32,662
BECAUSE YOU JUST WON FOUR TICKETS TO HIS SHOW!

319
00:17:32,695 --> 00:17:33,229

320
00:17:38,835 --> 00:17:40,236
HAVE FUN!

321
00:17:43,239 --> 00:17:45,842

00:17:45,875 --> 00:17:48,044
WE HAVE TICKETS TO THE KID!

323
00:17:48,077 --> 00:17:49,012
(Farting)

324
00:17:50,246 --> 00:17:52,849
SPINNER! NOT IN THE CAR, MAN.

325
00:17:54,117 --> 00:17:56,786
SORRY. EXCITEMENT MAKES ME FART.

326
00:17:57,954 --> 00:18:01,024
OH. YOU ARE SICK. THAT IS DISGUSTING!

327
00:18:02,392 --> 00:18:03,059
IT'S THE SPRAY CHEESE.

328
00:18:03,092 --> 00:18:04,794
I SHOULDN'T HAD THAT THIRD CAN.

329
00:18:04,827 --> 00:18:07,830
JUST DRIVE, JUST DRIVE.

330
00:18:12,368 --> 00:18:14,837
AM I GETTING GOOD, OR WHAT?

331
00:18:22,745 --> 00:18:25,014
JUST KEEP IT COOL, ALRIGHT?

332
00:18:28,351 --> 00:18:29,052
ROGER.

333
00:18:39,062 --> 00:18:41,197
WE'RE SO LUCKY.

334
00:18:41,230 --> 00:18:43,700
SO LUCKY. SO LET'S GO BACK, OKAY?

335
00:18:45,935 --> 00:18:46,135
OKAY.

336
00:18:57,013 --> 00:18:58,948
YOU GUYS, TALK ABOUT AMAZING.

337
00:18:58,982 --> 00:19:02,885
OH MY GOD, THAT WAS THE BEST DAY EVER! BEST DAY EVER!

338
00:19:02,919 --> 00:19:04,954
SERIOUS. FIRST WE TAKE A CAR OUT FOR A JOY RIDE...

339
00:19:04,988 --> 00:19:06,322
WE WIN KID ELRICK TICKETS...

340
00:19:06,356 --> 00:19:08,124
THEN WE PULL UP RIGHT BESIDE THE COPS?

341
00:19:08,157 --> 00:19:09,726
MAN, THAT PART WAS SO COOL!

342
00:19:09,759 --> 00:19:10,693
NOW YOU SAY IT'S COOL.

343
00:19:10,727 --> 00:19:12,762
BEFORE YOU WERE CRYING LIKE A LITTLE BABY.

344
00:19:12,795 --> 00:19:13,863
SHUT UP, MAN.

345
00:19:13,896 --> 00:19:15,098
I WAS CRYING BECAUSE OF YOUR CHEESE-FART. IT'S GROSS.

346
00:19:15,131 --> 00:19:16,466
YEAH, IT WAS.

347
00:19:16,499 --> 00:19:18,868
WHAT WERE YOU GUYS DOING?.

348
00:19:20,169 --> 00:19:23,473
DO THE WORDS 'SILENT ALARM' MEAN ANYTHING TO YOU?

349
00:19:23,506 --> 00:19:25,775
YOU, YOU, YOU. GONE. NOW!

350
00:19:34,884 --> 00:19:37,787
ARE YOU GONNA SAY SOMETHING? EVER?

351
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:38,855
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY.

352
00:19:38,888 --> 00:19:40,990
WHY? WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL?

353
00:19:41,024 --> 00:19:42,458
I ACTED LIKE AN IDIOT!

354
00:19:42,492 --> 00:19:44,761
AND I TOTALLY EMBARRASSED MYSELF.

355
00:19:44,794 --> 00:19:46,195
YEAH YOU DID.

356
00:19:47,030 --> 00:19:49,766
KIDDING. SO, WHAT HAPPENED?

357
00:19:52,201 --> 00:19:55,471
I'M JUST SCARED OF NEEDLES. I CAN'T EXPLAIN IT.

358
00:19:55,505 --> 00:19:58,775
THEN WHY WOULD YOU TRY A PIERCING?

359
00:19:58,808 --> 00:20:01,444
I DON'T KNOW I JUST - I THOUGHT IT'D LOOK COOL.

360
00:20:01,477 --> 00:20:04,781
AND THOUGHT I'D GAIN SOME POINTS WITH YOU.

361
00:20:04,814 --> 00:20:06,115
POINTS?

362
00:20:06,149 --> 00:20:06,949
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.

363
00:20:06,983 --> 00:20:08,851
NO. I DON'T.

364
00:20:09,252 --> 00:20:11,354
ASH, YOU'RE MY FRIEND.

365
00:20:11,387 --> 00:20:14,724
YOU DON'T NEED A PIERCING TO IMPRESS ME.

366
00:20:25,868 --> 00:20:26,002
SIT.

367
00:20:27,370 --> 00:20:28,905
YOU'RE NOT MY DAD.

368
00:20:28,938 --> 00:20:29,272
SIT!

369
00:20:41,884 --> 00:20:43,953
WHAT YOU DID WAS SERIOUS.

370
00:20:45,121 --> 00:20:46,856
YOU DROVE A CAR WITHOUT A LICENSE.

371
00:20:46,889 --> 00:20:48,991
YOU COULDA KILLED SOMEBODY!

372
00:20:49,025 --> 00:20:49,859
I KNOW -

373
00:20:49,892 --> 00:20:52,095
NO, I DON'T THINK YOU DO.

374
00:20:52,128 --> 00:20:53,996
IF YOU WERE SOME PUNK OFF THE STREET,

375
00:20:54,030 --> 00:20:58,201
I WOULD HAVE HAD YOU ARRESTED AND PRESSED CHARGES.

376
00:20:59,569 --> 00:21:01,504
CRAIG, I TRUSTED YOU.

377
00:21:04,607 --> 00:21:05,942
IT WAS STUPID.

378
00:21:05,975 --> 00:21:08,811
IT WAS SO STUPID, I ADMIT IT.

379
00:21:08,845 --> 00:21:11,347
AND I'M SORRY. I'M REALLY SORRY.

380
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:13,783
YOU'RE GROUNDED. THREE WEEKS.

381
00:21:15,551 --> 00:21:16,819
THREE WEEKS!?

382
00:21:18,254 --> 00:21:19,922
AND ONE MORE THING -

383
00:21:22,291 --> 00:21:23,493
WAIT, KID ELRICK?

384
00:21:26,329 --> 00:21:28,898
WELL, WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO TELL MY FRIENDS?

385
00:21:28,931 --> 00:21:33,202
SHOULD OF THOUGHT OF THAT BEFORE YOU TOOK THE CAR.
