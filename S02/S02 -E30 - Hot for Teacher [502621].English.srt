00:00:01,275 --> 00:00:03,444
THE PHYSICS OF ATTRACTION AND REPULSION -

2
00:00:03,477 --> 00:00:07,247
IS WHAT WE'RE GOING TO EXPLORE TODAY USING STATIC ELECTRICITY.

3
00:00:07,281 --> 00:00:09,550
SO I WANT ALL OF YOU TO PAY CAREFUL ATTENTION

4
00:00:09,583 --> 00:00:10,617
TO YOUR EXPERIMENTS

5
00:00:10,651 --> 00:00:14,755
AND PLEASE MAKE SURE THAT YOU TAKE DETAILED NOTES.

6
00:00:20,127 --> 00:00:22,730
WILL YOU BE MY FRIEND, TOBY ISAACS?

7
00:00:22,763 --> 00:00:25,599
WILL YOU SHUT UP AND DO YOUR WORK?

8
00:00:30,637 --> 00:00:31,105
HELLO!

9
00:00:31,138 --> 00:00:32,206
JT!

10
00:00:32,239 --> 00:00:33,140
UGH!

11
00:00:33,173 --> 00:00:35,309
I'M A MASTODON. I DIED 10,000 YEARS AGO.

12
00:00:35,342 --> 00:00:36,477
YOU RUINED THIS.

13
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:37,511
WILL YOU BE MY FRIEND?

14
00:00:37,544 --> 00:00:38,379
NO!

15
00:00:41,715 --> 00:00:44,184
YOU HAVE THE CUTEST BONES...

16
00:00:44,218 --> 00:00:46,553
I BET YOU SAY THAT TO ALL THE SKELETAL MASTODONS...

17
00:00:46,587 --> 00:00:51,191
NO... JUST YOU... I'M GONNA KISSY- KISS YOU ALL OVER...

18
00:00:53,827 --> 00:00:55,662
JT YORKE.

00:01:00,601 --> 00:01:02,636

00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:07,841
I'M SORRY TOO. OH DON'T LISTEN TO HIM, HE'S LYING.

THANKS.

36
00:02:22,549 --> 00:02:23,750
COME ON IN.

37
00:02:29,523 --> 00:02:31,325
GOOD MORNING MS. HATZILAKOS.

38
00:02:31,358 --> 00:02:32,826
OH, GOOD MORNING JT.

39
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:36,597
OKAY LET'S GET STARTED. RIGHT THIS WAY.

40
00:02:37,631 --> 00:02:41,401
SO WE MAINLY FEED THE GUINEA PIGS DRIED TIMOTHY GRASS.

41
00:02:41,435 --> 00:02:43,437
SUPPLEMENTED WITH PELLETS, FRESH VEGETABLES.

42
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:48,308
OF COURSE, THEY ALWAYS NEED A FRESH SUPPLY OF WATER.

43
00:02:49,543 --> 00:02:50,544
DO YOU MIND?

44
00:02:51,979 --> 00:02:53,447
OH SORRY.

45
00:02:59,486 --> 00:03:01,822
OH, IS THAT YOUR PEN ON THE GROUND?

46
00:03:01,855 --> 00:03:04,224
NOPE. MUST BE YOURS.

47
00:03:04,758 --> 00:03:07,661
OKAY, LET ME INTRODUCE YOU TO THE BROOD.

48
00:03:07,694 --> 00:03:10,864
RIGHT HERE WE HAVE JASPER, BISMARCK,

49
00:03:10,898 --> 00:03:13,634
AND THIS CUTIE IS ISABELLA.

50
00:03:16,737 --> 00:03:20,240
SHE'S LIKE A BIG BALL OF FLUFF.

51
00:03:20,274 --> 00:03:21,975
A REALLY FAT BALL OF FLUFF.

52
00:03:22,009 --> 00:03:25,512
YEAH, SHE IS MUCH BIGGER THEN USUAL.

53
00:03:27,581 --> 00:03:29,583
WELL LOOK AT YOU.

54
00:03:29,616 --> 00:03:31,618
YOU'VE HAVE THE MAGIC TOUCH.

55
00:03:31,652 --> 00:03:33,921
DID YOU EVER THINK OF BECOMING A VETERINARIAN?

56
00:03:33,954 --> 00:03:36,590
I TRIED ONCE, BUT THERE AREN'T ENOUGH RECIPES.

57
00:03:36,623 --> 00:03:37,824
PLUS I LOVE MEAT.

58
00:03:38,559 --> 00:03:41,562
I SAID VETERINARIAN, NOT VEGETARIAN.

59
00:03:41,595 --> 00:03:43,330
I KNOW. I WAS JOKING.

60
00:03:45,499 --> 00:03:49,670
"THE MEDIUM IS THE MESSAGE." DOES ANYONE KNOW WHO SAID THAT?

61
00:03:49,703 --> 00:03:50,837
MARSHALL MCLUHAN -

62
00:03:50,871 --> 00:03:53,473
THE GODFATHER OF MODERN MEDIA AND COMMUNICATIONS.

63
00:03:53,507 --> 00:03:55,542
AND DID YOU KNOW MCLUHAN WAS CANADIAN?

64
00:03:55,576 --> 00:03:58,545
HEY - HOW WAS YOUR 'QUALITY TIME'

65
00:03:58,579 --> 00:04:00,647
WITH MS. HOT SAUCE?

66
00:04:01,682 --> 00:04:02,649
HOT AND SAUCY.

67
00:04:04,418 --> 00:04:06,553
FULL REPORT. NOW.

68
00:04:06,587 --> 00:04:09,523
FIRST? I DID ONE OF THESE - OOPS!

69
00:04:10,791 --> 00:04:13,961
THEN SHE BENT DOWN TO PICK IT UP - OH!

70
00:04:15,329 --> 00:04:16,897
JT? IS THIS YOURS?

71
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:17,864
YEAH.

72
00:04:19,032 --> 00:04:22,035
YOU WANNA PAY ATTENTION? OKAY.

73
00:04:23,003 --> 00:04:23,670
ANYWAYS...

74
00:04:24,938 --> 00:04:28,642
YOU GUYS CAN'T IMAGINE THE THINGS I SAW...

75
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:37,618
NOT BAD, GAVIN. BUT WHAT EXACTLY IS A "SEXAGRAM"?

76
00:04:37,651 --> 00:04:39,820
THAT THINGY WITH SIX POINTS?

77
00:04:39,853 --> 00:04:42,589
AH NO, THAT'S A "HEXAGRAM".

78
00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:44,658
OH. OOPS.

79
00:04:44,958 --> 00:04:47,561
COME TAKE A LOOK AT THIS.

80
00:04:48,829 --> 00:04:50,497
YOU REALLY NEED TO TAKE ANOTHER LOOK AT YOUR ANSWER

81
00:04:50,530 --> 00:04:51,898
FOR PROBLEM NUMBER TEN.

82
00:04:51,932 --> 00:04:55,502
OH THAT HAS TO BE A TRICK QUESTION.

83
00:04:55,535 --> 00:04:59,339
AH NO, JUST UH, SIMPLE BATH - UH, MATH.

84
00:05:02,009 --> 00:05:05,846
JULIAN CAN I SEE YOUR ASSIGNMENT PLEASE?

85
00:05:09,916 --> 00:05:12,986
IS THAT SPINNER THAT SMELLS? SHOULD WE TELL HIM?

86
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:15,389
HONESTY NEVER HURTS.

87
00:05:17,958 --> 00:05:22,429
RULE NUMBER ONE OF PUBERTY? SHOWER EVERY DAY.

88
00:05:28,702 --> 00:05:30,070
DUDE, DUDE.

89
00:05:30,103 --> 00:05:31,838
THE TRUTH - DO I STINK?

90
00:05:31,872 --> 00:05:33,573
UM, YEAH, ACTUALLY.

91
00:05:33,607 --> 00:05:35,142
YOU'VE SMELLED REALLY BAD ALL WEEK.

92
00:05:35,175 --> 00:05:37,411
WELL, WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME?

93
00:05:37,444 --> 00:05:38,512
I DIDN'T WANT TO HURT YOUR FEELINGS.

94
00:05:38,545 --> 00:05:41,014
WELL, BETTER I HEAR IT FROM YOU, THEN ELLIE, DUDE.

95
00:05:41,048 --> 00:05:43,550
THE TRUTH FROM NOW ON, OKAY?

96
00:05:43,583 --> 00:05:46,520
"YOU CAN'T HANDLE THE TRUTH."

97
00:05:48,822 --> 00:05:50,023
JACK NICHOLSON.

98
00:05:50,057 --> 00:05:53,093
UM OKAY. BUT THIS - IT'S SERIOUS,

99
00:05:53,126 --> 00:05:55,629
IT'S IMPORTANT. COME ON, LET'S MAKE A PACT.

100
00:05:55,662 --> 00:05:57,531
SURE, MAN. WHATEVER.

101
00:05:57,831 --> 00:05:58,432
JIM-!

102
00:06:06,606 --> 00:06:08,542
OKAY IF IT TAKES FRED 45 SECONDS

103
00:06:08,575 --> 00:06:11,078
TO FILL HIS TEN LITRE FISH TANK,

104
00:06:11,111 --> 00:06:13,747
HOW LONG WILL IT TAKE HIM TO FILL HIS OTHER TANKS:

105
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:16,583
NOW, FIVE OF THEM ARE FIVE LITRE TANKS

106
00:06:16,616 --> 00:06:19,619
AND TEN OF THEM ARE TWO LITRE TANKS?

107
00:06:20,587 --> 00:06:24,491
YEAH, I THINK FRED NEEDS TO GET A LIFE.

108
00:06:24,524 --> 00:06:25,425
THANK YOU, MR. YORKE...

109
00:06:25,459 --> 00:06:28,628
JT HAS A LIFE. HE'S GOT A NEW GIRLFRIEND.

110
00:06:28,662 --> 00:06:29,930
REALLY? YOU MEAN LIBERTY?

111
00:06:29,963 --> 00:06:30,831
FINALLY!

112
00:06:30,864 --> 00:06:31,732
NO.

113
00:06:32,666 --> 00:06:34,134
MS. HOTS-O-LA-KOS...

114
00:06:36,136 --> 00:06:37,637
THAT IS SO TYPICAL.

115
00:06:38,772 --> 00:06:41,174
NO, SO JT. IMMATURE AND DUMB.

116
00:06:43,076 --> 00:06:44,311
WHY?

117
00:06:44,344 --> 00:06:47,914
WHAT'S WRONG WITH A YOUNGER GUY DATING AN OLDER WOMAN, ANYWAY?

118
00:06:47,948 --> 00:06:49,082
THERE'S A RULE.

119
00:06:49,116 --> 00:06:52,686
THE YOUNGEST YOU CAN DATE IS HALF YOUR AGE PLUS SEVEN.

120
00:06:52,719 --> 00:06:56,590
SO FOR MS. H - WHO'S, WHAT, THIRTY?

121
00:06:56,623 --> 00:06:58,759
THAT'S - FIFTEEN PLUS SEVEN...

122
00:06:58,792 --> 00:07:00,460
WHICH IS TWENTY-TWO.

123
00:07:00,494 --> 00:07:03,663
AND YOU'RE SHORT BY A COUPLE OF YEARS.

124
00:07:03,964 --> 00:07:07,033
AND MORE THEN A COUPLE OF FEET.

125
00:07:08,568 --> 00:07:11,538
MELANDA STARED INTO THE SOUL OF THE ECLIPSE.

126
00:07:11,571 --> 00:07:13,573
AND SAW THE WORLD FOR WHAT IT WAS -

127
00:07:13,607 --> 00:07:17,677
A SHADOW OF BLACK, EMPTY, DESPAIRING NOTHINGNESS.

128
00:07:22,682 --> 00:07:24,084
WOW. HAPPY.

129
00:07:26,987 --> 00:07:28,522
THOUGHTS ANYONE?

130
00:07:29,723 --> 00:07:30,791
JIMMY BROOKS?

131
00:07:31,858 --> 00:07:35,862
OH UH, WELL I, YOU KNOW - THOUGHT IT WAS POETIC.

132
00:07:39,099 --> 00:07:41,234
YO, YOU MADE A PROMISE, DUDE.

133
00:07:41,268 --> 00:07:42,602
SPIN - SHUT UP.

134
00:07:42,636 --> 00:07:44,771
GENTLEMEN, IF YOU HAVE ANY COMMENTS,

135
00:07:44,805 --> 00:07:46,540
PLEASE SHARE THEM WITH THE CLASS.

136
00:07:46,573 --> 00:07:47,674
I DON'T.

137
00:07:47,707 --> 00:07:49,910
OH, HE DOES, MS. KWAN. JIMMY?

138
00:07:52,145 --> 00:07:55,982
OKAY. I THOUGHT YOU WERE TRYING WAY TO HARD TO BE PROFOUND

139
00:07:56,016 --> 00:07:58,552
AND YOU JUST LOST THE STORY.

140
00:07:59,052 --> 00:08:02,656
HONESTLY? IT SOUNDED LIKE A SUICIDE NOTE.

141
00:08:03,256 --> 00:08:06,092
WELL, I WOULDN'T EXPECT A CONFORMIST TO UNDERSTAND.

142
00:08:06,126 --> 00:08:10,797
ASHLEY - THIS EXERCISE IS ABOUT CONSTRUCTIVE CRITICISM.

143
00:08:10,831 --> 00:08:13,233
OKAY WE'VE GOT ABOUT FIFTEEN MINUTES LEFT.

144
00:08:13,266 --> 00:08:15,202
ENOUGH TIME FOR TWO MORE VOLUNTEERS.

145
00:08:15,235 --> 00:08:18,638
ANYONE? STEVEN, ARE YOU READY TO READ?

146
00:08:18,672 --> 00:08:19,940
HEY, WHAT'S UP?

147
00:08:20,607 --> 00:08:24,644
JT! I WANT TO SHOW YOU SOMETHING.

148
00:08:25,579 --> 00:08:27,747
I'LL BET SHE DOES...

149
00:08:30,584 --> 00:08:32,619
WELL, I THOUGHT ABOUT WHAT YOU SAID -

150
00:08:32,652 --> 00:08:34,788
ABOUT ISABELLA'S WEIGHT PROBLEM.

151
00:08:34,821 --> 00:08:37,824
WELL IT'S NOT THAT - SHE'S PREGNANT!

152
00:08:39,059 --> 00:08:42,762
WOW. A HUNDRED LITTLE GUINEA PIGS JUST WAITING TO BE BORN.

153
00:08:42,796 --> 00:08:44,731
WELL, MORE LIKE THREE OR FOUR.

154
00:08:44,764 --> 00:08:46,867
YOU CAN FEEL THEM, INSIDE HER. THAT'S HOW I REALIZED.

155
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:47,300
HERE.

156
00:08:49,603 --> 00:08:51,104
RIGHT THERE.

157
00:08:52,105 --> 00:08:54,007
CAN YOU FEEL THEM?

158
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:54,574
WOW.

159
00:08:56,643 --> 00:08:58,178
I CAN'T BELIEVE ISABELLA IS GONNA BE A MOM.

160
00:08:58,211 --> 00:08:59,779
THAT IS SO COOL.

161
00:08:59,813 --> 00:09:00,714
DOES SHE NEED ANYTHING?

162
00:09:00,747 --> 00:09:03,850
LIKE - A SPECIAL DIET OR SOMETHING?

163
00:09:04,885 --> 00:09:07,254
HOW ABOUT I DO SOME RESEARCH?

164
00:09:07,287 --> 00:09:11,892
THAT'D BE GREAT. THAT WOULD BE A GREAT HELP, THANKS JT.

165
00:09:14,394 --> 00:09:16,062
IT'S OKAY.

166
00:09:33,046 --> 00:09:34,281
WHAT'RE YOU DOING HERE?

167
00:09:34,314 --> 00:09:36,383
AND ON YOUR LUNCH HOUR?

168
00:09:36,416 --> 00:09:40,687
JUST TRYING TO DO SOME RESEARCH FOR MS. HATZILAKOS.

169
00:09:44,257 --> 00:09:45,992
YOUR SPELLING...

170
00:09:46,026 --> 00:09:47,894
AH, THERE IS SUCH A THING AS PRIVACY, YOU KNOW.

171
00:09:47,928 --> 00:09:50,664
YEAH, I KNOW, BUT --

172
00:09:52,299 --> 00:09:53,900
OH... THANKS.

173
00:09:54,834 --> 00:09:56,236
NO PROBLEM.

174
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:02,375
NOW - WHEN MANNY RUBS THE BALLOONS ON HER HAIR,

175
00:10:02,409 --> 00:10:04,277
THEY BECOME NEGATIVELY-CHARGED.

176
00:10:04,311 --> 00:10:08,648
AND THEY BECOME ATTRACTED TO HER POSITIVELY-CHARGED HAIR.

177
00:10:08,682 --> 00:10:10,951
NOW THE MOMENT MANNY STEPS AWAY ...

178
00:10:10,984 --> 00:10:12,719
THE BALLOONS REPEL

179
00:10:12,752 --> 00:10:16,089
BECAUSE THEY'RE BOTH NEGATIVELY-CHARGED.

180
00:10:17,457 --> 00:10:19,392
MS. HATZILAKOS - CAN I SEE YOU FOR A SECOND?

181
00:10:19,426 --> 00:10:20,460
AH, SURE.

182
00:10:20,493 --> 00:10:21,728
WHY DON'T YOU CONTINUE BLOWING UP YOUR BALLOONS.

183
00:10:21,761 --> 00:10:23,930
AND I'LL JUST BE A MINUTE.

184
00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:32,439
LOOKS LIKE YOUR GIRLFRIEND HAS A BOYFRIEND.

185
00:10:32,472 --> 00:10:34,741
MR. ARMSTRONG IS MARRIED.

186
00:10:34,774 --> 00:10:37,377
SO? MS. HATZILAKOS ISN'T.

187
00:10:37,944 --> 00:10:40,113
SHE'S NOT LIKE THAT.

188
00:10:40,947 --> 00:10:42,082
IT WAS A JOKE.

189
00:10:42,115 --> 00:10:44,384
YEAH REMEMBER?

190
00:10:44,417 --> 00:10:46,753
YOU USED TO TELL THEM?

191
00:10:48,755 --> 00:10:50,824
HELLO I'M A MASTODON.

192
00:10:51,825 --> 00:10:53,727
TOBY SHUT UP? I'M TRYING TO CONCENTRATE.

193
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,695
SORRY, LIBERTY.

194
00:10:56,296 --> 00:10:57,697
SO TEACHER'S PET,

195
00:10:57,731 --> 00:11:00,133
WHEN IS MS. H GETTING YOU YOUR OWN CAGE?

196
00:11:00,166 --> 00:11:01,868
I'M NOT HER PET.

197
00:11:01,901 --> 00:11:04,204
OH REALLY. LET'S SEE HERE.

198
00:11:04,237 --> 00:11:08,241
WE'VE GOT JASPER, BISMARCK, ISABELLA - JT.

199
00:11:14,481 --> 00:11:16,282
WHAT'S THE MATTER SEAN? HUH?

200
00:11:16,316 --> 00:11:17,717
YOU JEALOUS?

201
00:11:17,751 --> 00:11:20,253
DO YOU WANT TO BE MY OTHER GUINEA PIG BOY?

202
00:11:20,286 --> 00:11:21,855
OH AND WHAT ABOUT YOU, TOBY?

203
00:11:21,888 --> 00:11:24,958
MY, MY, MY YOU'RE A FURRY LITTLE ONE.

204
00:11:28,528 --> 00:11:31,064
YEAH, I'M SURE YOU DO-

205
00:11:46,246 --> 00:11:48,081
ASH AND I WERE THIS CLOSE TO RECONNECTING -

206
00:11:48,114 --> 00:11:51,051
AND YOU HAD TO RUIN IT WITH YOUR STUPID HONESTY PACT.

207
00:11:51,084 --> 00:11:54,487
DUDE, YOU DID HER A FAVOUR. SHE SHOULD HAVE THANKED YOU.

208
00:11:54,521 --> 00:11:56,222
YEAH WELL TELL HER THAT.

209
00:11:56,256 --> 00:11:58,825
SPIN, SOMETIMES PEOPLE DON'T WANT THE WHOLE TRUTH.

210
00:11:58,858 --> 00:11:59,893
WELL, THEN THEY'RE STUPID.

211
00:11:59,926 --> 00:12:02,829
IF IT WAS ME? I'D WANT THE WHOLE TRUTH ENCHILADA.

212
00:12:02,862 --> 00:12:04,130
JIMMY.

213
00:12:05,365 --> 00:12:06,800
ASH. UHM, LOOK,

214
00:12:06,833 --> 00:12:09,035
I'M REALLY SORRY ABOUT YESTERDAY.

215
00:12:09,069 --> 00:12:11,371
ACTUALLY? YOU SAVED MY STORY.

216
00:12:11,404 --> 00:12:12,439
WHAT?

217
00:12:12,472 --> 00:12:13,540
YOU WERE RIGHT.

218
00:12:13,573 --> 00:12:15,475
I WENT THROUGH IT LAST NIGHT AND MADE SOME CHANGES

219
00:12:15,508 --> 00:12:17,243
AND IT IS WAY BETTER.

220
00:12:19,145 --> 00:12:20,980
I LIKE THIS NEW JIMMY.

221
00:12:25,485 --> 00:12:27,187
I GUESS YOU WERE RIGHT, MAN.

222
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:30,523
ALL HONESTY - ALL THE TIME FROM NOW ON.

223
00:12:30,557 --> 00:12:33,326
GOOD. CAN I BE HONEST WITH YOU?

224
00:12:33,359 --> 00:12:35,195
GO AHEAD. WE'RE TIGHT.

225
00:12:35,528 --> 00:12:37,997
OKAY. YOU AND ASH GETTING BACK TOGETHER?

226
00:12:38,031 --> 00:12:40,300
THE STUPIDEST IDEA I EVER HEARD.

227
00:12:40,333 --> 00:12:41,000
WHAT?

228
00:12:41,034 --> 00:12:42,402
WELL, YOU BECOME THIS WEAK,

229
00:12:42,435 --> 00:12:44,838
PATHETIC PUPPET WHEN SHE'S AROUND.

230
00:12:44,871 --> 00:12:47,841
AND SHE'S THE EVIL PUPPETMASTER.

231
00:12:47,874 --> 00:12:49,375
HERE THIS IS YOU -

232
00:12:50,176 --> 00:12:51,478
ASHLEY I DON'T WHAT TO GO...

233
00:12:51,511 --> 00:12:53,813
(WHIPPING SOUND) OKAY, OKAY I'M GOING.

234
00:12:53,847 --> 00:12:54,514
OW, THAT HURTS. OW.

235
00:12:54,547 --> 00:12:57,083
OKAY, OKAY I GET IT.

236
00:12:57,117 --> 00:12:58,485
THANKS FOR THE HONESTY.

237
00:12:58,518 --> 00:13:00,220
DUDE? MY PLEASURE.

238
00:13:23,877 --> 00:13:26,146
LOOK I'M SORRY, OKAY?

239
00:13:29,649 --> 00:13:31,217
I APOLOGIZE.

240
00:13:31,251 --> 00:13:32,085
THANK YOU.

241
00:13:35,588 --> 00:13:36,523
THAT'S' IT?

242
00:13:37,557 --> 00:13:38,591
PARDON ME.

243
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:43,463
I APOLOGIZED. WHAT MORE DO YOU WANT?

244
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:49,502
JT DO YOU KNOW WHY I'M ANGRY?

245
00:13:50,537 --> 00:13:52,639
BECAUSE OF THE THING I DID.

246
00:13:52,672 --> 00:13:56,376
YES. BUT DO YOU KNOW WHY I'M REALLY ANGRY?

247
00:13:58,578 --> 00:13:58,845
NO.

248
00:14:01,548 --> 00:14:03,950
LOOK, YOU'RE FUNNY, OKAY?

249
00:14:03,983 --> 00:14:06,319
BUT YOU'RE ALSO VERY INTELLIGENT,

250
00:14:06,352 --> 00:14:09,622
AND YOU'RE JUST WASTING IT BY ALWAYS BEING THE CLASS CLOWN.

251
00:14:09,656 --> 00:14:11,491
JUST WASTING IT.

252
00:14:15,261 --> 00:14:19,165
WELL THEN I'LL JUST STOP WASTING YOUR TIME.

253
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:21,868
I'LL TRANSFER OUT OF YOUR CLASS.

254
00:14:22,402 --> 00:14:26,005
WELL YOU DO WHAT EVER IT IS YOU NEED TO DO.

255
00:14:39,586 --> 00:14:42,455
WHAT'RE YOU DOING? SCHOOL'S OUT.

256
00:14:43,089 --> 00:14:45,925
IT'S AN HONESTY LIST ABOUT SPINNER.

257
00:14:45,959 --> 00:14:46,726
ARE YOU CRAZY?

258
00:14:46,759 --> 00:14:49,562
NO, IT'S CONSTRUCTIVE CRITICISM.

259
00:14:49,596 --> 00:14:52,432
"YOU'RE CHEAP." VERY CONSTRUCTIVE.

260
00:14:52,465 --> 00:14:55,602
OKAY, DON'T MAKE ME START A TERRI LIST.

261
00:14:55,635 --> 00:14:59,505
TOP ITEM? NOSEY - DOESN'T MIND OWN BUSINESS.

262
00:15:10,016 --> 00:15:11,351
OH GREAT. HELLO?

263
00:15:15,488 --> 00:15:15,989
OH NO!

264
00:15:16,689 --> 00:15:17,390
MS. H!

265
00:15:18,658 --> 00:15:20,126
MS. HATZILAKOS.

266
00:15:23,296 --> 00:15:23,596
MS. H!

267
00:15:24,364 --> 00:15:25,298
I'M ON MY WAY OUT.

268
00:15:25,331 --> 00:15:26,132
YEAH I KNOW. BUT I NEED YOUR HELP.

269
00:15:26,165 --> 00:15:28,568
WELL MY OFFICE IS OPEN EARLY TOMORROW.

270
00:15:28,601 --> 00:15:31,371
NO, IT'S ISABELLA. SHE GOT OUT OF HER CAGE.

271
00:15:31,404 --> 00:15:32,705
WHAT? OH NO!

272
00:15:33,506 --> 00:15:34,974
I WAS JUST ON MY WAY TO CLEAN THE ROOM

273
00:15:35,008 --> 00:15:37,010
AND THE DOOR WAS LOCKED.

274
00:15:38,511 --> 00:15:39,512
I WAS JUST WALKING BY

275
00:15:39,545 --> 00:15:41,381
AND I SAW THAT SHE WAS UNDERNEATH THE DESK.

276
00:15:41,414 --> 00:15:42,482
THE CAGE...

277
00:15:43,516 --> 00:15:47,020
WAIT. THERE SHE IS. OKAY.

278
00:15:47,053 --> 00:15:49,322
SHHH, LET'S BE VERY QUIET.

279
00:15:49,355 --> 00:15:50,189
OKAY.

280
00:15:50,690 --> 00:15:53,126
CLOSE THE DOOR BEHIND YOU.

281
00:15:53,159 --> 00:15:54,527
ALL RIGHT.

282
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:55,762
TRY NOT TO SCARE HER.

283
00:15:55,795 --> 00:15:57,063
COME ON ISABELLA.

284
00:15:57,096 --> 00:15:58,431
I'LL TRY TO PUSH HER TOWARDS YOU.

285
00:15:58,464 --> 00:16:02,402
THAT'S A GOOD GIRL. COME ON.

286
00:16:02,735 --> 00:16:03,403
OH! SH--.

287
00:16:03,436 --> 00:16:05,171
GO! GO! YOU GO THAT WAY.

288
00:16:05,204 --> 00:16:06,205
GO THAT WAY.

289
00:16:07,507 --> 00:16:07,774
OH, THERE SHE IS.

290
00:16:07,807 --> 00:16:08,541
QUIET.

291
00:16:10,443 --> 00:16:12,011
I GOT HER, I GOT HER, I GOT HER, I GOT HER.

292
00:16:12,045 --> 00:16:12,512
OW!

293
00:16:13,646 --> 00:16:14,447
OH MY ELBOW!

294
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:15,214
THERE SHE IS.

295
00:16:15,248 --> 00:16:15,982
WHERE DID SHE GO?

296
00:16:16,015 --> 00:16:18,284
RIGHT THERE, RIGHT THERE.

297
00:16:18,651 --> 00:16:21,454
WHERE DID SHE GO?

298
00:16:21,487 --> 00:16:23,456
LOOKS LIKE SHE JUST FOUND A DARK, SAFE SPOT

299
00:16:23,489 --> 00:16:25,291
TO HAVE HER BABIES.

300
00:16:27,527 --> 00:16:29,662
THAT'S WHAT THEY LIKE TO DO.

301
00:16:31,397 --> 00:16:34,767
I DID SOME GUINEA PIG RESEARCH ON THE COMPUTER.

302
00:16:34,801 --> 00:16:36,502
SHE'S NOT SAFE, JT.

303
00:16:36,536 --> 00:16:38,671
THE JANITOR'S SPREAD RAT POISON ALL AROUND THE SCHOOL.

304
00:16:38,705 --> 00:16:39,806
BECAUSE OF RODENT PROBLEMS...

305
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:40,540
WHAT?!

306
00:16:42,608 --> 00:16:43,910
ISABELLA! COME ON!

307
00:16:46,412 --> 00:16:50,350
16. DANCES LIKE A STUPID ROBOT. 17. BAD TASTE IN MOVIES.

308
00:16:50,383 --> 00:16:52,552
AND 18. SHOOTS BASKETS LIKE A GIRL.

309
00:16:52,585 --> 00:16:53,953
OKAY, DUDE ARE YOU DONE?

310
00:16:53,986 --> 00:16:57,190
UM. ONE MORE THING. YOU SAY 'DUDE' LIKE EVERY THIRD WORD.

311
00:16:57,223 --> 00:16:58,591
OH YEAH? WELL YOU HAVE A SHINY FOREHEAD, DUDE.

312
00:16:58,624 --> 00:16:59,292
WHAT?

313
00:16:59,325 --> 00:17:01,561
AND... CAN YOU STOP COPYING ME?

314
00:17:01,594 --> 00:17:02,562
YOU'RE THE ONE THAT COPIES ME.

315
00:17:02,595 --> 00:17:04,397
OKAY, POPPY-SEED BAGELS!

316
00:17:04,430 --> 00:17:05,631
THE SEEDS STICK TO YOUR TEETH

317
00:17:05,665 --> 00:17:07,533
AND YOU WALK AROUND ALL DAY LIKE SOME POPPY-TOOTHED FREAK.

318
00:17:07,567 --> 00:17:08,434
SHRIMP CHIPS!

319
00:17:08,468 --> 00:17:10,570
THEY MAKE YOU STINK UP THE CHANGEROOM.

320
00:17:10,603 --> 00:17:11,938
SHRIMP AND B.O.

321
00:17:11,971 --> 00:17:14,607
YOU'RE A BUM AND YOU HANG OUT AT MY HOUSE TOO MUCH.

322
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,242
THAT'S BECAUSE YOU PEE ON THE TOILET SEAT!

323
00:17:16,275 --> 00:17:19,579
MY MOM DOESN'T WANT YOU OVER!

324
00:17:19,612 --> 00:17:19,812
WHAT!

325
00:17:22,382 --> 00:17:26,552
COME ON ISABELLA, COME ON.

326
00:17:26,586 --> 00:17:28,488
THIS IS ALL MY FAULT -

327
00:17:28,521 --> 00:17:30,156
I THINK I LEFT HER CAGE OPEN WHEN I FED HER.

328
00:17:30,189 --> 00:17:31,591
NO, NO, IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT.

329
00:17:31,624 --> 00:17:33,359
COME ON!

330
00:17:33,393 --> 00:17:35,695
I CAN'T QUITE REACH HER.

331
00:17:36,429 --> 00:17:41,601
WELL IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE SHE'S COMING OUT ANY TIME SOON.

332
00:17:41,634 --> 00:17:43,469
LOOK JT I CAN STAY,

333
00:17:43,503 --> 00:17:44,604
YOU CAN GO.

334
00:17:44,637 --> 00:17:44,704
NO.

335
00:17:46,572 --> 00:17:49,475
LOOK, CAN YOU CALL MY PARENTS?

336
00:17:49,509 --> 00:17:53,112
TELL THEM I'M STAYING HERE UNTIL ISABELLA COMES OUT.

337
00:17:53,146 --> 00:17:55,748
OKAY, BUT THIS COULD TAKE AWHILE.

338
00:17:55,782 --> 00:17:56,883
THAT'S OKAY,

339
00:17:56,916 --> 00:17:58,284
COME ON.

340
00:18:00,887 --> 00:18:03,156
MAYBE WE HAVE TO LURE HER OUT.

341
00:18:03,189 --> 00:18:06,192
MAKE IT SEEM MORE COMFORTABLE OUT HERE.

342
00:18:06,225 --> 00:18:07,894
IT'S HOPELESS.

343
00:18:07,927 --> 00:18:09,228
IF I WASN'T SO TIRED.

344
00:18:09,262 --> 00:18:13,599
I SAW ON THE NET THAT THEY LIKE SOFT MUSIC AND LOW LIGHTS.

345
00:18:13,633 --> 00:18:18,504
HEY, YOU EVER WONDER WHY THEY CALL THEM GUINEA PIGS?

346
00:18:18,538 --> 00:18:21,541
I MEAN, THEY'RE NOT FROM GUINEA AND THEY'RE NOT PIGS.

347
00:18:21,574 --> 00:18:22,909
THEY'RE RODENTS.

348
00:18:22,942 --> 00:18:25,611
EXACTLY. IT'S LIKE QUICKSAND.

349
00:18:25,645 --> 00:18:26,579
THEY CALL IT QUICK-SAND,

350
00:18:26,612 --> 00:18:29,549
BUT IT ACTUALLY WORKS REALLY REALLY SLOWLY.

351
00:18:29,582 --> 00:18:31,250
AND A BOXING RING IS SQUARE.

352
00:18:31,284 --> 00:18:32,618
STAND-UP COMIC, HUH?

353
00:18:32,652 --> 00:18:35,555
ALL RIGHT, I CAN SEE IT.

354
00:18:35,588 --> 00:18:39,425
SO SHOULD I GIVE UP MY DREAMS OF VET-HOOD?

355
00:18:40,593 --> 00:18:44,497
NO, YOU SHOULD DO EXACTLY WHAT IT IS THAT YOU WANT DO.

356
00:18:44,530 --> 00:18:48,801
BUT MAKE SURE YOU GRADUATE FROM SCHOOL FIRST.

357
00:18:51,304 --> 00:18:54,474
WERE YOU ALWAYS A SCIENCE TEACHER?

358
00:18:54,507 --> 00:18:56,676
I MEAN, NEVER A - A MODEL?

359
00:18:59,612 --> 00:19:02,148
NO. TEACHING IS MY LIFE, JT.

360
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:10,857
AND THAT'S WHY WHAT YOU DID - REALLY HURT ME.

361
00:19:15,728 --> 00:19:17,196
I'M SORRY OKAY.

362
00:19:18,498 --> 00:19:19,499
I REALLY AM.

363
00:19:24,370 --> 00:19:27,773
UH JT, YOUR PLAN WORKED.

364
00:19:28,674 --> 00:19:29,075
LOOK.

365
00:19:32,945 --> 00:19:33,479
HEY.

366
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:36,282
CLOSE THE DOOR.

367
00:19:36,315 --> 00:19:38,484
ALL RIGHT, GOOD JOB.

368
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:47,793
ANYMORE HONESTY YOU WANNA SHARE?

369
00:19:47,827 --> 00:19:50,563
UM YEAH - YOUR IDEA SUCKED.

370
00:19:51,864 --> 00:19:54,734
YEAH. THE TRUTH DOES HURT.

371
00:19:57,570 --> 00:20:01,974
OKAY, LET'S TAKE OUT YOUR COPIES OF "THE CHRYSALIDS".

372
00:20:09,649 --> 00:20:12,919
GENTLEMEN? IS THERE SOMETHING WRONG?

373
00:20:12,952 --> 00:20:16,222
UM... NO NOTHING AT ALL - HONEST.

374
00:20:17,790 --> 00:20:19,725
YEAH WE WERE JUST TALKING ABOUT

375
00:20:19,759 --> 00:20:23,429
HOW STUNNING YOU LOOK TODAY, MS. KWAN.

376
00:20:25,665 --> 00:20:28,601
OKAY, LET'S START WITH THE THEME.

377
00:20:34,473 --> 00:20:37,276
YOU KNOW I WASN'T REALLY GOING TO TRANSFER OUT OF YOUR CLASS?

378
00:20:37,310 --> 00:20:39,478
REALLY? MAYBE YOU SHOULD HAVE.

379
00:20:39,512 --> 00:20:40,947
THE TOUGH PART OF THE TERM STARTS TODAY.

380
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:43,316
I'VE GOT A KILLER POP QUIZ.

381
00:20:43,349 --> 00:20:43,749
GOTCHA.

382
00:20:45,017 --> 00:20:46,619
OKAY HOW DID EVERY ONE DO WITH THEIR HOMEWORK ASSIGNMENT?

383
00:20:46,652 --> 00:20:47,653
HEY.

384
00:20:47,687 --> 00:20:49,555
I HEARD YOU HAD A LITTLE "QUALITY TIME" LAST NIGHT

385
00:20:49,589 --> 00:20:51,657
WITH MS. HOT SAUCE.

386
00:20:51,691 --> 00:20:53,459
YEAH SO THROW US A BONE HERE.

387
00:20:53,492 --> 00:20:55,294
WHAT HAPPENED?

388
00:20:55,328 --> 00:20:58,664
LAST NIGHT? WELL THE LIGHTS WERE DIMMED.

389
00:20:59,031 --> 00:21:01,734
SOFT MUSIC PLAYED ON THE RADIO.

390
00:21:01,767 --> 00:21:04,937
WE JUST LOOKED INTO EACH OTHER'S EYES.

391
00:21:05,705 --> 00:21:07,773
I MEAN, WE WERE THIS CLOSE.

392
00:21:08,808 --> 00:21:09,542
AND...

393
00:21:09,575 --> 00:21:10,576
AND...

394
00:21:12,011 --> 00:21:13,613
IT WAS BEAUTIFUL.

395
00:21:15,681 --> 00:21:16,882
ISABELLA CRAWLED IN HER CAGE

396
00:21:16,916 --> 00:21:21,387
AND HAD HER BABIES FIFTEEN MINUTES LATER.

397
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:21,787
THAT'S IT?

398
00:21:21,821 --> 00:21:23,356
THAT'S ALL?

399
00:21:25,591 --> 00:21:30,596
HEY GUINEA PIG CHILDBIRTH IS A VERY EXCITING PROCESS, GUYS.
