HEY. SORRY.

JIMMY, SEAN?

39
00:02:37,417 --> 00:02:38,818
NOW THAT'S THE KIND OF TEAMWORK

40
00:02:38,852 --> 00:02:41,655
I WANT TO SEE IN THE REGIONALS GENTLEMEN.

41
00:02:41,688 --> 00:02:42,389
NO PROBLEM.

42
00:02:42,422 --> 00:02:43,623
YOU GOT IT COACH.

43
00:02:43,657 --> 00:02:45,992
GOOD WORK.

44
00:02:49,396 --> 00:02:52,899
MAN, MAN YOU GUYS, YOU REALLY DO PLAY GREAT TOGETHER,

45
00:02:52,933 --> 00:02:53,900
LIKE VINCE AND JYD.

46
00:02:57,938 --> 00:02:59,773
OH, WAIT. DID I JUST BREAK THE-

47
00:02:59,806 --> 00:03:02,776
'DON'T TALK TO SEAN AND JIMMY AT THE SAME TIME' RULE?

48
00:03:02,809 --> 00:03:03,777
SHUT UP, SPINNER.

49
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:05,812
NO, YOU SHUT UP.

50
00:03:05,845 --> 00:03:10,317
I MEAN OKAY, YOU TWO, YOU HAD A FIGHT, A LONG, LONG TIME AGO.

51
00:03:10,350 --> 00:03:13,286
WHY DON'T YOU JUST LET IT GO.

52
00:03:18,992 --> 00:03:19,659
ASK HIM.

53
00:03:21,761 --> 00:03:22,829
I'M HAVING A PARTY TONIGHT,

54
00:03:22,862 --> 00:03:24,798
TO CELEBRATE MAKING THE REGIONALS.

55
00:03:24,831 --> 00:03:28,001
AND YOU CAN BRING EMMA IF YOU WANT TO.

56
00:03:28,868 --> 00:03:29,269
COOL.

57
00:03:33,106 --> 00:03:36,443
AH, YOU TWO, YOU'VE MADE ME VERY, VERY HAPPY!

58
00:03:36,476 --> 00:03:40,647
DUDE, DUDE. ARMPITS - NEAR THE FACE.

59
00:03:44,651 --> 00:03:47,420
SO IS SEAN EXCITED ABOUT TONIGHT?

60
00:03:47,454 --> 00:03:49,656
EM, YOU DIDN'T TELL HIM, DID YOU?

61
00:03:49,689 --> 00:03:50,924
IF I TOLD HIM LAST WEEK,

62
00:03:50,957 --> 00:03:53,360
HE WOULD HAVE WORRIED HIMSELF INTO A COMA.

63
00:03:53,393 --> 00:03:56,496
WELL, ENOUGH'S ENOUGH, YOU HAVE TO TELL HIM,

64
00:03:56,529 --> 00:03:56,863
LIKE RIGHT NOW.

65
00:03:57,897 --> 00:03:58,832
SEAN!

66
00:03:59,699 --> 00:04:00,634
EMMA.

67
00:04:01,034 --> 00:04:04,471
HI. UM, ARE YOU BUSY TONIGHT?

68
00:04:04,504 --> 00:04:06,640
WHY AM I GETTING THAT WEIRD, SCARY VIBE?

69
00:04:06,673 --> 00:04:10,510
UM, BECAUSE, AAHH. I KNOW THIS SOUNDS AWFUL,

70
00:04:10,543 --> 00:04:11,745
BUT MY PARENTS WERE WONDERING

71
00:04:11,778 --> 00:04:13,713
IF MAYBE YOU WANTED TO COME TO DINNER?

72
00:04:13,747 --> 00:04:14,914
NO!

73
00:04:14,948 --> 00:04:17,751
BUT YOU HAVE TO. I TOLD THEM YOU'RE COMING.

74
00:04:17,784 --> 00:04:20,720
EMMA, WE HAVE JIMMY'S PARTY TONIGHT. WE WERE INVITED.

75
00:04:20,754 --> 00:04:22,522
YEAH, I KNOW. BUT, I THINK MY PARENTS

76
00:04:22,555 --> 00:04:23,723
WILL BE A LITTLE MORE DISAPPOINTED

77
00:04:23,757 --> 00:04:26,359
IF YOU DON'T SHOW UP, THAN JIMMY WILL.

78
00:04:26,393 --> 00:04:28,895
OOHH. HEY, ONE WORD FOR YOU -

79
00:04:28,928 --> 00:04:29,896
CHATORO.

80
00:04:30,897 --> 00:04:32,432
CHATU -? EMMA!

81
00:04:32,465 --> 00:04:36,569
IT'S A KIND OF SUSHI, YOU KNOW, RAW FISH.

82
00:04:36,603 --> 00:04:38,071
YEAH, I KNOW.

83
00:04:38,104 --> 00:04:40,840
ANYWAY, MY MOM MAKES IT FOR SPECIAL OCCASIONS,

84
00:04:40,874 --> 00:04:42,842
SO YOU HAVE TO COME.

85
00:04:42,876 --> 00:04:45,712
WE'LL GO TO JIMMY'S AFTER, I PROMISE.

86
00:04:45,745 --> 00:04:48,348
OH, PLEASE? PLEASSSSEE?

87
00:05:00,126 --> 00:05:02,495
CHECKING OUT ASHLEY, HUH?

88
00:05:02,996 --> 00:05:04,731
DUDE, COULD YOU BE MORE PREDICTABLE?

89
00:05:04,764 --> 00:05:05,665
LOOK, ASH HAS CHANGED.

90
00:05:05,699 --> 00:05:07,767
SHE'S NOT THE SAME GIRL HE WAS LAST YEAR.

91
00:05:07,801 --> 00:05:10,937
OH, YEAH, YEAH, I KNOW. SHE'S BECOME A VAMPIRE!

92
00:05:10,970 --> 00:05:13,506
I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT HER STYLE.

93
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:14,908
I MEAN SHE'S MORE DOWN TO EARTH.

94
00:05:17,043 --> 00:05:17,977
YEAH.

95
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:22,115
OH, TER, I'M HAVING A PARTY TONIGHT AT MY HOUSE.

96
00:05:22,148 --> 00:05:22,949
CAN YOU MAKE IT?

97
00:05:22,982 --> 00:05:23,850
TOTALLY!

98
00:05:24,784 --> 00:05:26,519
TELL ASH SHE CAN COME TOO. IF SHE WANTS.

99
00:05:26,553 --> 00:05:27,954
IT'S NO BIG DEAL.

100
00:05:30,023 --> 00:05:31,858
AH, ASH TOO, NO BIG DEAL.

101
00:05:33,793 --> 00:05:35,862
HM, UH, MY ARMPITS SMELL.

102
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:38,998
A VOTE. HANDS OR FEET?

103
00:05:39,032 --> 00:05:40,800
ARE WE SUPPOSED TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THAT MEANS?

104
00:05:40,834 --> 00:05:42,836
IT MEANS - MY WEEKEND AT THE SPA WITH MOM

105
00:05:42,869 --> 00:05:45,138
INCLUDES EITHER A FREE MANICURE OR PEDICURE. MY CHOICE.

106
00:05:45,171 --> 00:05:46,940
YOU'RE MISSING JIMMY'S PARTY FOR A PEDICURE?

107
00:05:46,973 --> 00:05:48,608
NO, FOR A SPA WEEKEND.

108
00:05:48,641 --> 00:05:51,978
IT'S MORE FUN THAN A ROOMFUL OF NEANDERTHALS.

109
00:05:52,011 --> 00:05:53,913
SO EL? HOW ABOUT YOU?

110
00:05:53,947 --> 00:05:56,015
I'D HAVE MORE FUN SCULPTING MY EARWAX.

111
00:05:56,116 --> 00:05:57,951
WHY, ARE YOU GOING?

112
00:05:58,752 --> 00:06:00,553
NO... I DON'T THINK SO.

113
00:06:00,587 --> 00:06:02,088
ASH, YOU SO WANT TO GO.

114
00:06:02,122 --> 00:06:03,890
BUT HE DIDN'T REALLY INVITE ME.

115
00:06:03,923 --> 00:06:04,991
HE JUST SORT-OF INVITED ME.

116
00:06:05,024 --> 00:06:07,727
I'VE SEEN THE WAY HE LOOKS AT YOU. HE STILL LIKES YOU.

117
00:06:07,761 --> 00:06:09,162
I'M NOT SURE I BELIEVE THAT, TER.

118
00:06:09,195 --> 00:06:10,797
WELL, ONLY ONE WAY TO FIND OUT.

119
00:06:17,904 --> 00:06:19,873
SEAN, IT'S JUST A JOB, OKAY?

120
00:06:19,906 --> 00:06:21,040
EVERYTHING'S GOING TO BE ALRIGHT.

121
00:06:21,074 --> 00:06:25,245
YOU KNOW WHAT? THAT'S WHAT DAD SAID. AND IT NEVER WAS.

122
00:06:25,278 --> 00:06:28,515
I KNOW. I KNOW, BUT ME AND YOU,

123
00:06:28,548 --> 00:06:30,049
WE'RE NOT MOM AND DAD, RIGHT?

124
00:06:30,083 --> 00:06:33,787
NO? WE LIVE LIKE THEM. YOU'RE OUT OF WORK.

125
00:06:34,888 --> 00:06:38,892
YEAH, MONEY'S IMPORTANT SEAN, BUT SO'S MY PRIDE.

126
00:06:39,859 --> 00:06:42,929
YOU KNOW WHAT TRACKER? YOU SOUND JUST LIKE DAD,

127
00:06:42,962 --> 00:06:45,198
WHENEVER HE LOST HIS JOB OR WHENEVER HE QUIT

128
00:06:45,231 --> 00:06:46,800
OR WHENEVER HE GOT FIRED AND HE JUST-

129
00:06:46,833 --> 00:06:47,934
YEAH, EXCEPT FOR THEN HE'D GO AND TAKE ALL OF OUR MONEY

130
00:06:47,967 --> 00:06:49,903
AND BLOW IT ON BOOZE.

131
00:06:51,004 --> 00:06:52,839
YOU SEE ME DOING THAT?

132
00:06:52,872 --> 00:06:54,007
NO.

133
00:06:54,541 --> 00:06:55,942
THAT'S RIGHT.

134
00:06:55,975 --> 00:07:00,580
LOOK, I'VE GOT A JOB INTERVIEW LINED UP FOR TOMORROW.

135
00:07:00,613 --> 00:07:02,949
DOES THAT SOUND LIKE DAD?

136
00:07:02,982 --> 00:07:04,851
AREN'T YOU SPECIAL.

137
00:07:06,019 --> 00:07:07,487
I'M TRYING.

138
00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:11,191
WHERE YOU GOING WITH MY PICKLED HERRING, PUNK?

139
00:07:13,293 --> 00:07:16,796
TONIGHT I, I HAVE DINNER WITH EMMA'S PARENTS.

140
00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:18,865
WELL, ISN'T THAT NICE.

141
00:07:18,898 --> 00:07:21,501
SAY HELLO TO THE FAMILY FOR ME.

142
00:07:35,582 --> 00:07:36,883
EM, NERVOUS?

143
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:39,319
NOT FOR ME, FOR SEAN.

144
00:07:39,352 --> 00:07:42,288
YOU GUYS AREN'T GOING TO GRILL HIM, RIGHT?

145
00:07:42,322 --> 00:07:46,025
JUST THE OCTOPUS. BUT I HEAR YOU, OKAY?

146
00:07:46,059 --> 00:07:47,527
BLACK. AAAAHHH.

147
00:07:51,731 --> 00:07:53,800
JUST RELAX.

148
00:08:10,116 --> 00:08:12,218
YOU KNOW, I WAS READING THAT THE AVERAGE SUMO WRESTLER

149
00:08:12,252 --> 00:08:13,553
WEIGHS AROUND FOUR HUNDRED POUNDS.

150
00:08:13,586 --> 00:08:16,589
AND ONE OF THE BEST TIPPED THE SCALE AT SEVEN HUNDRED POUNDS.

151
00:08:16,623 --> 00:08:17,824
CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT?

152
00:08:17,857 --> 00:08:19,325
THAT'S BECAUSE THEY EAT LIKE A TON OF RICE,

153
00:08:19,359 --> 00:08:21,027
MORNING, NOON AND NIGHT.

154
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:22,896
MMM. SPEAKING OF RICE,

155
00:08:24,097 --> 00:08:27,867
I THINK I'M GOING TO HAVE SOME MORE OF THE KAMABOKO.

156
00:08:27,901 --> 00:08:32,071
SO. SEAN. I HEAR YOU'RE QUITE THE BASKETBALL STAR?

157
00:08:34,374 --> 00:08:36,109
AH, I'M OKAY I GUESS.

158
00:08:36,843 --> 00:08:37,810
NOW DON'T BE MODEST.

159
00:08:37,844 --> 00:08:39,913
I SAW YOU TEARING UP THE COURT THE OTHER DAY.

160
00:08:39,946 --> 00:08:41,247
YOUR PARENTS MUST BE PROUD.

161
00:08:41,281 --> 00:08:43,917
OH, EMMA, CAN YOU PASS THE NEGI TORO, PLEASE?

162
00:08:43,950 --> 00:08:44,884
YEAH, SURE.

163
00:08:45,885 --> 00:08:47,787
THEY'RE IN WASAGA BEACH. I LIVE WITH MY BROTHER.

164
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:48,655
OH, RIGHT.

165
00:08:50,056 --> 00:08:53,993
AH, MOM - UM, THE CALIFORNIA ROLL LOOKS GREAT.

166
00:08:54,027 --> 00:08:55,762
WHAT DOES YOUR BROTHER DO?

167
00:08:55,795 --> 00:08:56,863
WELL HE'S-

168
00:08:56,896 --> 00:08:57,597
SNAKE!

169
00:08:58,731 --> 00:09:01,000
IT'S ALL RIGHT. EMMA, IT'S ALL RIGHT.

170
00:09:01,034 --> 00:09:04,170
HE INSTALLS SIDE-VIEW MIRRORS ON MINI-VANS.

171
00:09:04,203 --> 00:09:07,373
OH, HE'S AN AUTO-WORKER. IT'S A NOBLE PROFESSION.

172
00:09:07,407 --> 00:09:09,609
YEAH. HE QUIT YESTERDAY.

173
00:09:11,344 --> 00:09:13,880
OH... I'M SORRY TO HEAR THAT.

174
00:09:17,850 --> 00:09:21,020
UM, YOU GUYS MIND IF I GET SOME WATER?

175
00:09:21,354 --> 00:09:24,057
NO, NOT AT ALL. HELP YOURSELF.

176
00:09:28,061 --> 00:09:30,863
YOU GUYS - I THOUGHT I ASKED YOU NOT TO DO THIS.

177
00:09:30,897 --> 00:09:31,931
IT'S JUST THAT CHILDREN

178
00:09:31,965 --> 00:09:35,702
SHOULDN'T HAVE TO LIVE WITH THAT KIND OF STRESS.

179
00:09:41,975 --> 00:09:44,243
DOES ANYBODY ELSE WANT ANY WATER?

180
00:09:44,277 --> 00:09:46,846
NO, I THINK WE'RE ALL FINE.

181
00:09:46,879 --> 00:09:47,747
OKAY.

182
00:10:11,204 --> 00:10:15,441
SO, SEAN. HAVE YOU SEEN ANY GOOD MOVIES LATELY?

183
00:10:15,475 --> 00:10:16,142
MM - NO.

184
00:10:17,210 --> 00:10:21,280
OH. I REALLY LIKE THEM. MR. SIMPSON, SNAKE AND I,

185
00:10:22,348 --> 00:10:26,019
WE LIKE THEM. GOING TO THEM. DON'T WE?

186
00:10:27,787 --> 00:10:29,255
YEAH, YES. A LOT.

187
00:10:31,524 --> 00:10:33,259
POPCORN, SODA... GODZILLA.

188
00:10:37,997 --> 00:10:38,398
COOL.

189
00:10:48,374 --> 00:10:50,176
EMMA, YOU WANT SOME MORE PIE?

190
00:10:50,209 --> 00:10:51,244
YEAH, SURE.

191
00:10:51,277 --> 00:10:52,612
OOOHHH! OOHH!

192
00:10:52,645 --> 00:10:56,149
I'M SORRY! I'M SORRY. HERE, LET ME HELP YOU CLEAN IT.

193
00:10:56,182 --> 00:11:00,019
NO, IT'S OKAY. NO REALLY, I'LL JUST GO CHANGE.

194
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:02,989
YOU KNOW, I FEEL LIKE SOME COFFEE.

195
00:11:03,022 --> 00:11:06,259
I'M GOING TO PUT A POT ON.

196
00:11:12,065 --> 00:11:14,867
SO AH, SNAKE AND I ARE REALLY GLAD THAT YOU COULD COME.

197
00:11:14,901 --> 00:11:18,237
IT'S GIVEN US A CHANCE TO GET TO KNOW EACH OTHER A BIT MORE.

198
00:11:18,271 --> 00:11:19,472
NO PROBLEM.

199
00:11:19,505 --> 00:11:21,808
ANYTIME.

200
00:11:21,841 --> 00:11:25,378
HEY - WHY DON'T I PACK YOU UP SOME LEFT-OVERS?

201
00:11:25,411 --> 00:11:27,380
YOU ALREADY MADE ME DINNER.

202
00:11:27,413 --> 00:11:30,149
GIVE YOU A NICE HOME-COOKED MEAL.

203
00:11:30,850 --> 00:11:34,454
BECAUSE I DON'T GET NICE, HOME-COOKED MEALS AT HOME?

204
00:11:34,487 --> 00:11:36,756
SEAN, WE JUST HAVE EXTRA.

205
00:11:37,190 --> 00:11:38,791
FOR A WELFARE CASE.

206
00:11:39,525 --> 00:11:41,427
THAT'S NOT WHAT I WAS SAYING.

207
00:11:41,461 --> 00:11:42,995
SEAN?!

208
00:11:43,029 --> 00:11:45,898
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

209
00:11:45,932 --> 00:11:46,232
SEAN!

210
00:12:08,421 --> 00:12:10,957
I SHOULDN'T BE HERE...

211
00:12:11,491 --> 00:12:12,859
SPINNER!

212
00:12:13,459 --> 00:12:17,930
HEY! TERRI. ASH. GREAT, YOU CAME.

213
00:12:20,199 --> 00:12:21,367
WHERE'S PAIGE?

214
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:23,870
AT THE SPA. BUT WE'RE HERE.

215
00:12:25,238 --> 00:12:27,840
OH-HO, YEAH. GREAT, THAT - OOH-

216
00:12:31,210 --> 00:12:33,846
YOU SHOULD GO FIND JIMMY.

217
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:34,947
I ALREADY HAVE.

218
00:12:36,582 --> 00:12:37,850
SO. YOU CAME.

219
00:12:40,386 --> 00:12:40,987
I CAME.

220
00:12:41,654 --> 00:12:42,255
THAT'S GOOD.

221
00:12:45,525 --> 00:12:45,925
GOOD.

222
00:12:50,396 --> 00:12:52,899
HEY JIMMY!

223
00:12:55,201 --> 00:13:00,139
SORRY. I GOT GUESTS TO ATTEND TO. UM, I'LL CATCH YOU LATER.

224
00:13:06,212 --> 00:13:10,449
WOW. I GUESS HE REALLY DIDN'T WANT ME TO COME AFTER ALL.

225
00:13:10,483 --> 00:13:12,552
I KNOW THE FEELING.

226
00:13:19,492 --> 00:13:20,092
HEY, I-

227
00:13:23,529 --> 00:13:24,597
WHERE'S SEAN?

228
00:13:25,598 --> 00:13:26,933
HE UH - HE LEFT.

229
00:13:28,701 --> 00:13:31,237
WHAT? WHY?

230
00:13:32,238 --> 00:13:33,039
WHAT DID YOU SAY?

231
00:13:33,072 --> 00:13:35,441
NOTHING. I OFFERED HIM LEFTOVERS.

232
00:13:35,474 --> 00:13:37,043
HE TOTALLY MISUNDERSTOOD.

233
00:13:37,076 --> 00:13:38,945
AND THAT'S ALL. HONEST.

234
00:13:38,978 --> 00:13:39,946
YEAH, REALLY.

235
00:13:39,979 --> 00:13:40,479
EMMA -

236
00:13:41,247 --> 00:13:42,582
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

237
00:13:42,615 --> 00:13:43,616
TO FIND HIM.

238
00:13:47,653 --> 00:13:49,288
(DOOR BELL)

239
00:13:52,592 --> 00:13:54,694
WHOAH! WHAT'S GOING ON? THERE'S A PARTY HERE.

240
00:13:54,727 --> 00:13:55,761
OH, I THOUGHT YOU WEREN'T COMING MAN.

241
00:13:55,795 --> 00:13:58,998
NO, I AM. THIS IS A PARTY. I LOVE PARTIES! YEAH!

242
00:13:59,031 --> 00:14:00,499
WHAT'S GOING ON?

243
00:14:00,533 --> 00:14:03,402
YEAH, A PARTY! WHOO, HOO, HOOO!

244
00:14:03,436 --> 00:14:06,672
HEY MAN, YOU KNOW, GOT TO GET TO MY LADIES, TEND TO THEM.

245
00:14:06,706 --> 00:14:07,640
SEE YOU LATER.

246
00:14:07,673 --> 00:14:09,342
SWEET NIGHT. HE'S GOT LADIES!

247
00:14:09,375 --> 00:14:12,578
SO, WHAT'S GOING ON BUDDY? WHAT DO YOU SAY?

248
00:14:12,612 --> 00:14:14,213
YEAH, UM,

249
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:16,649
HAVE YOU BEEN DRINKING?

250
00:14:16,682 --> 00:14:18,284
NO. MAYBE A LITTLE.

251
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:22,488
COME ON MAN, LET'S GO.

252
00:14:22,521 --> 00:14:27,293
NO, INTRODUCE ME TO SOME PEOPLE. JIMMY! WHAT'S GOING ON?

253
00:14:27,326 --> 00:14:28,227
HEY. YOU MADE IT.

254
00:14:28,261 --> 00:14:29,662
YEAH! HA, HA!

255
00:14:29,695 --> 00:14:34,200
WHAT'S UP? WHAT'S UNDER-? UH, NAPKINS, I NEED NAPKINS.

256
00:14:39,772 --> 00:14:41,007
CATCH YOU BOYS LATER?

257
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:41,974
YEAH.

258
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:50,716
SO AH, WHERE'S EMMA?

259
00:14:51,217 --> 00:14:54,487
EMMA? AH, SHE'S AT HOME. WE'RE THROUGH.

260
00:14:57,290 --> 00:15:00,226
WHAT? YOU GUYS JUST GOT BACK TOGETHER.

261
00:15:00,259 --> 00:15:02,295
I KNOW, ALL RIGHT?

262
00:15:02,328 --> 00:15:04,063
BUT HER MOM CALLED ME A TOTAL WELFARE CASE OR SOMETHING

263
00:15:04,096 --> 00:15:07,166
SO I TOLD HER OFF AND I LEFT.

264
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:11,737
I TOTALLY FREAKED OUT AND WHATEVER, OKAY. IT'S OVER.

265
00:15:11,771 --> 00:15:14,707
AND OBVIOUSLY EMMA'S NEVER GOING TO FORGIVE ME.

266
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:17,610
YOU DON'T KNOW THAT. CALL HER.

267
00:15:17,643 --> 00:15:20,146
NO MAN. IT'S OVER. ALL RIGHT?

268
00:15:20,179 --> 00:15:22,081
SEAN, JUST PICK UP THE PHONE.

269
00:15:22,114 --> 00:15:23,616
OKAY?

270
00:15:23,649 --> 00:15:24,050
OKAY.

271
00:15:24,684 --> 00:15:26,385
OKAY.

272
00:15:26,752 --> 00:15:27,753
YOU COMING?

273
00:15:28,621 --> 00:15:30,756
YEAH, JUST GIVE ME A MINUTE.

274
00:16:09,128 --> 00:16:11,731
YOU, PLUS ME - DESTINY.

275
00:16:11,764 --> 00:16:13,699
OKAY, LET'S GO.

276
00:16:18,571 --> 00:16:20,573
ASH! YOU CAN'T GO.

277
00:16:21,774 --> 00:16:23,209
UH, YES I CAN.

278
00:16:23,242 --> 00:16:25,511
NO, NO! WE DIDN'T TALK YET.

279
00:16:26,112 --> 00:16:28,381
YOU'VE GOT A LOT OF GUESTS.

280
00:16:29,382 --> 00:16:32,318
YOU'RE THE GUEST I WANT TO BE WITH.

281
00:16:37,390 --> 00:16:39,792
I CAN STICK AROUND FOR A BIT.

282
00:16:40,626 --> 00:16:41,694
THAT'S GREAT.

283
00:16:49,769 --> 00:16:51,771
SEAN! SEAN!

284
00:16:59,712 --> 00:17:01,714
HERE YOU ARE.

285
00:17:01,747 --> 00:17:05,651
I'M SO SORRY ABOUT MY MOM. WHAT DID SHE SAY EXACTLY?

286
00:17:05,684 --> 00:17:06,552
EXACTLY?

287
00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:09,455
YEAH. I WANT TO CALL HER ON IT. WHAT DID SHE SAY?

288
00:17:09,488 --> 00:17:13,392
SHE SAID THE TRUTH, ALL RIGHT? SHE SAID THE TRUTH.

289
00:17:13,426 --> 00:17:16,829
SEAN ARE YOU DRUNK? WHERE DID YOU GET THAT?

290
00:17:17,563 --> 00:17:21,734
MY HOST, JIMMY BROOKS. AND IT'S TIME FOR A REFILL.

291
00:17:21,767 --> 00:17:23,536
SEAN!

292
00:17:23,569 --> 00:17:25,838
NO, EMMA! CALM DOWN!

293
00:17:25,871 --> 00:17:27,139
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO GIVE ME FOR IT?

294
00:17:27,173 --> 00:17:28,240
SEAN! NO!

295
00:17:29,708 --> 00:17:30,910
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO GIVE ME FOR IT?

296
00:17:30,943 --> 00:17:32,778
SEAN!

297
00:17:44,723 --> 00:17:49,295
SO YOU COME TO MY HOUSE TO STEAL MY PARENTS' BOOZE?

298
00:17:49,328 --> 00:17:50,296
JIMMY, COME ON MAN.

299
00:17:50,329 --> 00:17:53,699
YOUR PARENTS ARE SO RICH THEY WON'T EVEN KNOW.

300
00:17:53,732 --> 00:17:55,401
JUST GET OUT OF HERE.

301
00:17:56,936 --> 00:17:58,270
AT LEAST LET ME CLEAN IT UP--

302
00:17:58,304 --> 00:17:59,572
JUST GET OUT!

303
00:18:17,256 --> 00:18:18,891
AGH!

304
00:18:24,797 --> 00:18:25,197
HERE.

305
00:18:32,638 --> 00:18:35,841
YOU KNOW WHAT? UM, TERRI'S WAITING.

306
00:18:45,651 --> 00:18:49,455
I DON'T FEEL GOOD. I HAVE TO GO HOME.

307
00:18:55,694 --> 00:18:57,830
WHY DO YOU EVEN BOTHER?

308
00:18:58,664 --> 00:18:59,565
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

309
00:18:59,598 --> 00:19:03,402
I'M JUST A BIG, STUPID LOSER.

310
00:19:03,435 --> 00:19:07,439
MY PARENTS ARE DRUNKS. MY BROTHER'S OUT OF WORK.

311
00:19:09,975 --> 00:19:13,345
JUST A BIG STUPID LOSER, LIKE THEM.

312
00:19:13,379 --> 00:19:15,481
YEAH, SO IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT TO SAY?

313
00:19:15,514 --> 00:19:17,616
DO YOU WANT ME TO CALL YOU A BIG, STUPID LOSER, SEAN?

314
00:19:17,650 --> 00:19:19,485
IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT?

315
00:19:26,058 --> 00:19:27,526
WHO ARE YOU CALLING?

316
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:27,960
MY MOM.

317
00:19:29,828 --> 00:19:31,330
WHAT? NO, HANG UP.

318
00:19:31,730 --> 00:19:34,800
MOM? YOU KNOW YOU SAID IF I EVER NEEDED,

319
00:19:34,833 --> 00:19:37,403
YOU'D PICK ME UP, NO QUESTIONS ASKED?

320
00:19:37,436 --> 00:19:40,372
GREAT. WE'RE OUTSIDE JIMMY'S.

321
00:19:49,782 --> 00:19:51,550
HOW'S YOUR HAND?

322
00:19:51,584 --> 00:19:52,751
I'LL SURVIVE.

323
00:19:52,785 --> 00:19:54,720
I'M SORRY ABOUT THE OTHER NIGHT.

324
00:19:54,753 --> 00:19:58,057
AH, THE PARTY GOT OUT OF HAND. I GOT SERIOUS FLAK THOUGH.

325
00:19:58,090 --> 00:20:01,060
THAT'S NOT WHAT I MEAN. I MEAN,-

326
00:20:01,093 --> 00:20:04,663
OH. AH, LOOK, I GUESS IT'S KIND OF MY FAULT

327
00:20:04,697 --> 00:20:05,798
BECAUSE I WEIRDED YOU-

328
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:08,901
SO NOW WE'RE EVEN.

329
00:20:09,768 --> 00:20:11,837
HEY, JIMMY -

330
00:20:24,516 --> 00:20:25,818
SEAN!

331
00:20:27,086 --> 00:20:29,788
SEAN, SEAN, WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS?

332
00:20:29,822 --> 00:20:31,624
BECAUSE I SCREWED UP, ALL RIGHT EMMA?

333
00:20:31,657 --> 00:20:33,826
ONCE. EVERYBODY SCREWS UP ONCE.

334
00:20:33,859 --> 00:20:35,094
EMMA, HOMEROOM IS ABOUT TO START.

335
00:20:35,127 --> 00:20:39,498
I KNOW, BUT THIS IS MORE IMPORTANT. SO STOP.

336
00:20:46,572 --> 00:20:48,707
THINGS ARE ALWAYS GONNA BE LIKE THIS.

337
00:20:48,741 --> 00:20:49,775
LIKE WHAT?

338
00:20:49,808 --> 00:20:52,578
ME SCREWING UP. IT'S IN MY BLOOD.

339
00:20:52,611 --> 00:20:55,447
IT'S IN YOUR HEAD. AND THAT'S ALL.

340
00:20:56,015 --> 00:20:58,817
YOUR MOM AND SIMPSON AREN'T GOING BE AS FORGIVING.

341
00:20:58,851 --> 00:21:01,920
DID MY MOM GIVE YOU THE THIRD DEGREE?

342
00:21:02,421 --> 00:21:02,821
NO...

343
00:21:04,056 --> 00:21:07,059
I MEAN, IF SHE HAS TO DRIVE YOU HOME DRUNK A SECOND TIME,

344
00:21:07,092 --> 00:21:09,795
IT MIGHT BE A DIFFERENT STORY.

345
00:21:09,828 --> 00:21:11,897
YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THAT, ALL RIGHT?

346
00:21:11,930 --> 00:21:15,067
TRACKER GAVE ME A LECTURE AND I JUST DON'T-

347
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:16,368
OKAY, BUT THIS ISN'T ABOUT TRACKER,

348
00:21:16,402 --> 00:21:18,003
OR YOUR PARENTS, OR MY PARENTS.

349
00:21:18,037 --> 00:21:20,105
THIS IS ABOUT YOU AND ME.

350
00:21:25,444 --> 00:21:26,845
SEAN, I LIKE YOU.

351
00:21:29,915 --> 00:21:31,050
I LIKE YOU TOO.
