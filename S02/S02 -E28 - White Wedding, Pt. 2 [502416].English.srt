1
00:00:01,266 --> 00:00:04,102
HOW COULD YOU EVEN THINK OF HAVING AN ABORTION?

2
00:00:04,136 --> 00:00:05,470
IT'S A WOMAN'S CHOICE.

3
00:00:05,504 --> 00:00:06,672
WHAT ABOUT THE BABY'S CHOICE?

4
00:00:06,705 --> 00:00:09,841
I'M NOT GONNA DEBATE THIS WITH YOU. IT'S MY DECISION, EM.

5
00:00:09,875 --> 00:00:10,909
WHAT ABOUT SNAKE?

6
00:00:10,942 --> 00:00:12,944
OF COURSE, HE'D BE A PART OF IT.

7
00:00:12,978 --> 00:00:14,613
YEAH, LIKE HE'S A PART OF IT RIGHT NOW.

8
00:00:14,646 --> 00:00:16,915
EMMA, YOU'RE WAY OUT OF LINE.

9
00:00:16,948 --> 00:00:19,117
WHAT DO YOU EXPECT ME TO SAY?

10
00:00:19,151 --> 00:00:21,620
MAYBE SOMETHING SUPPORTIVE.

11
00:00:22,154 --> 00:00:23,722
IF YOU HAD AN ABORTION THE FIRST TIME,

12
00:00:23,755 --> 00:00:24,856
I WOULDN'T BE HERE.

13
00:00:24,890 --> 00:00:25,724
WELL IF YOU WERE IN MY SHOES,

14
00:00:25,757 --> 00:00:28,827
AND MADE THIS MISTAKE A SECOND TIME?

15
00:00:30,429 --> 00:00:33,432
EM... NO, I DIDN'T MEAN IT THAT WAY.

16
00:00:36,835 --> 00:00:38,770
♪ Whatever it takes

17
00:00:40,572 --> 00:00:43,108
♪ I know I can make it though

18
00:00:45,911 --> 00:00:47,512
♪ If I hold out

19
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:49,548
♪ If I do

20
00:00:49,581 --> 00:00:52,417
♪ I know I can make it through

21
00:00:57,689 --> 00:00:58,790
♪ Be the best

22
00:00:58,824 --> 00:01:01,159
♪ The best that I can be

23
00:01:02,694 --> 00:01:04,830
♪ Hear what I say to you

24
00:01:05,964 --> 00:01:07,766
♪ Whatever it takes

25
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:09,768
♪ I can see it

26
00:01:09,801 --> 00:01:12,637
♪ I know I can make it through

27
00:01:14,139 --> 00:01:16,975
♪ I know I can make it through

28
00:01:24,082 --> 00:01:27,619
OKAY, FANCY PROBABLY WON'T BE ON FOR AWHILE.

29
00:01:27,652 --> 00:01:29,654
BUT WE'LL HAVE TO STAY AWAKE, OKAY?

30
00:01:29,688 --> 00:01:30,856
YEAH, YEAH, OKAY.

31
00:01:30,889 --> 00:01:32,924
I'LL TAKE FIRST SHIFT, YOU TAKE SECOND.

32
00:01:32,958 --> 00:01:33,692
DEAL.

33
00:01:36,895 --> 00:01:37,896
WHAT IF WE GET CAUGHT?

34
00:01:37,929 --> 00:01:38,830
WE WON'T.

35
00:01:38,864 --> 00:01:41,066
AND EVEN IF WE DO, WHAT'RE WE DOING WRONG?

36
00:01:41,099 --> 00:01:42,834
I DON'T KNOW. INVASION OF PRIVACY?

37
00:01:42,868 --> 00:01:44,035
TOBY, SHE'S A STRIPPER.

38
00:01:44,069 --> 00:01:45,937
PRIVACY ISN'T IN HER VOCABULARY.

39
00:01:45,971 --> 00:01:48,507
YEAH, I GUESS YOU'RE RIGHT. SHE IS TAKING OFF HER CLOTHES.

40
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:50,542
AND SHE'S GETTING PAID.

41
00:01:50,575 --> 00:01:51,843
I JUST WISH WE WERE INSIDE.

42
00:01:51,877 --> 00:01:52,911
I KNOW.

43
00:01:52,944 --> 00:01:54,946
BUT WE'LL STILL BE CLOSER THAN EITHER OF US HAVE COME

44
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:56,882
TO SEEING A REAL LIVE NAKED WOMAN.

45
00:01:56,915 --> 00:01:57,949
EXCEPT FOR THAT TIME

46
00:01:57,983 --> 00:02:00,786
WHEN YOU WALKED IN ON YOUR GRANDMA IN THE SHOWER.

47
00:02:00,819 --> 00:02:02,721
WE BOTH AGREED - THAT NEVER HAPPENED.

48
00:02:02,754 --> 00:02:03,054
RIGHT.

49
00:02:03,088 --> 00:02:04,189
COME ON.

50
00:02:06,892 --> 00:02:09,027
GO, GO, GO, GO.

51
00:02:16,868 --> 00:02:19,938
TIME TO TEST OUT THE FANCY CAM.

52
00:02:22,808 --> 00:02:23,308
RADITCH!

53
00:02:23,341 --> 00:02:23,775
RADITCH!

54
00:02:23,809 --> 00:02:25,010
AHHHHH!

55
00:02:25,043 --> 00:02:27,846
TURN IT OFF! TURN IT OFF!

56
00:02:28,613 --> 00:02:29,614
SORRY.

57
00:02:30,248 --> 00:02:32,517
WHY IS HE THERE?

58
00:02:32,551 --> 00:02:33,585
IT'S GETTING LATE.

59
00:02:33,618 --> 00:02:34,553
I THOUGHT WE WERE HEADING TO THE BOWLING ALLEY.

60
00:02:34,586 --> 00:02:36,788
OH, YOU WERE SERIOUS ABOUT THE BOWLING ALLEY?

61
00:02:36,822 --> 00:02:38,123
WHAT? BOWLING'S FUN.

62
00:02:38,156 --> 00:02:39,191
ARCHIE, MY MAN.

63
00:02:39,224 --> 00:02:41,259
THIS IS YOUR STAG AND I WANT YOU TO GET INTO IT.

64
00:02:41,293 --> 00:02:42,127
RIGHT, MR. RADITCH.

65
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,162
AND I MEAN - RIGHT NOW.

66
00:02:44,196 --> 00:02:46,031
AND IT'S DAN TONIGHT.

67
00:02:46,064 --> 00:02:47,766
OOH! CHEESE BALLS.

68
00:02:52,971 --> 00:02:54,306
I'M SURE SHE DIDN'T MEAN IT.

69
00:02:54,339 --> 00:02:57,008
SHE SAID, "SAME MISTAKE TWICE."

70
00:02:57,042 --> 00:02:59,277
YEAH, BUT SHE DIDN'T HAVE AN ABORTION.

71
00:02:59,311 --> 00:03:00,045
SO?

72
00:03:00,846 --> 00:03:02,848
SO, YOU WERE WANTED.

73
00:03:02,881 --> 00:03:04,049
OKAY, FINE, WHATEVER!

74
00:03:04,082 --> 00:03:05,584
BUT THIS ISN'T ABOUT ME.

75
00:03:05,617 --> 00:03:08,887
IT'S ABOUT MY FUTURE HALF-BROTHER... OR SISTER.

76
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:10,155
AND WHAT ABOUT SNAKE?

77
00:03:10,188 --> 00:03:10,889
EMMA -

78
00:03:11,890 --> 00:03:13,625
I MEAN, HERE WE ARE DEBATING ABORTION

79
00:03:13,658 --> 00:03:16,995
AND HE DOESN'T EVEN KNOW SHE'S PREGNANT.

80
00:03:17,028 --> 00:03:19,698
WHAT IF SHE DOESN'T TELL HIM?

81
00:03:19,731 --> 00:03:22,801
DO NOT EVEN THINK OF INTERFERING.

82
00:03:22,834 --> 00:03:25,170
DON'T WORRY. I'M NOT THAT STUPID.

83
00:03:25,203 --> 00:03:27,105
GOOD. SO LET'S GET SOME SLEEP.

84
00:03:27,138 --> 00:03:32,010
BECAUSE TOMORROW'S GOING TO BE A LONG AND WONDERFUL DAY.

85
00:03:42,787 --> 00:03:43,622
WOW!

86
00:03:45,056 --> 00:03:45,991
YEAH! YEAH.

87
00:03:46,958 --> 00:03:47,659
(DOOR BELL)

88
00:03:47,692 --> 00:03:48,159
HOLD ON.

89
00:03:50,295 --> 00:03:52,664
GUYS, THE PARTY'S STARTED.

90
00:04:00,972 --> 00:04:01,239
HI.

91
00:04:02,407 --> 00:04:02,941
HEY.

92
00:04:04,676 --> 00:04:05,810
ARE YOU SNAKE?

93
00:04:05,844 --> 00:04:07,178
WHY, YES, I AM.

94
00:04:07,212 --> 00:04:07,946
NO, YOU'RE NOT.

95
00:04:07,979 --> 00:04:08,613
COME ON!

96
00:04:08,647 --> 00:04:10,982
GO UPSTAIRS, GO UPSTAIRS NOW.

97
00:04:11,016 --> 00:04:12,284
HI, COME ON IN.

98
00:04:15,153 --> 00:04:15,987
(Clapping)

99
00:04:19,858 --> 00:04:22,894
UH, THAT'S SNAKE RIGHT OVER THERE.

100
00:04:22,928 --> 00:04:23,862
JEREMIAH...

101
00:04:25,764 --> 00:04:29,167
IT'S YOUR PARTY MAN, HAVE FUN.

102
00:04:32,971 --> 00:04:34,172
OW! WHOO HOO HOO!

103
00:04:34,205 --> 00:04:36,207
SO, SNAKE.

104
00:04:54,125 --> 00:04:56,227
EMMA DOESN'T HATE YOU.

105
00:04:56,261 --> 00:04:58,730
IF YOU COULDA SEEN THE LOOK IN HER EYES.

106
00:04:58,763 --> 00:05:00,298
WHAT WAS I THINKING?

107
00:05:00,332 --> 00:05:03,168
YEAH, BUT YOU'VE JUST BEEN THROWN FOR A MAJOR LOOP.

108
00:05:03,201 --> 00:05:05,904
YOU GOT TO CUT YOURSELF SOME SLACK.

109
00:05:05,937 --> 00:05:07,372
I NEED TO TALK TO ARCHIE.

110
00:05:07,405 --> 00:05:09,908
UH, NOT TONIGHT THOUGH, RIGHT?

111
00:05:09,941 --> 00:05:12,978
BACHELOR PARTY - NOT IN A STATE TO HEAR THIS.

112
00:05:13,011 --> 00:05:14,679
HE NEEDS TO KNOW.

113
00:05:14,713 --> 00:05:17,115
AND YOU NEED TO GET YOURSELF TOGETHER. RIGHT?

114
00:05:17,148 --> 00:05:19,884
CALL IN THE MORNING. IT CAN WAIT.

115
00:05:26,758 --> 00:05:29,227
IT'S GOING TO BE OKAY.

116
00:06:40,999 --> 00:06:41,399
AHHHHH!

117
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:42,834
AHHHH!

118
00:06:42,867 --> 00:06:43,268
AHHHHH!

119
00:06:44,869 --> 00:06:47,005
WHAT ARE YOU TWO DOING HERE?

120
00:06:47,872 --> 00:06:50,141
SEEING A STRIPPER. AND YOU?

121
00:06:53,445 --> 00:06:55,847
OH, SURPRISE, SURPRISE.

122
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:56,881
COME HERE, COME HERE - BOTH OF YOU.

123
00:06:56,915 --> 00:06:57,482
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

124
00:06:57,515 --> 00:06:58,450
GET IN THE HOUSE!

125
00:06:58,483 --> 00:07:01,853
BOTH OF YOU! DO YOU KNOW WHAT TIME IT IS?

126
00:07:01,886 --> 00:07:04,889
MR. SIMPSON, WE NEED TO TALK.

127
00:07:06,124 --> 00:07:08,426
YOUR PARENTS MUST BE WORRIED SICK.

128
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:09,861
MY PARENTS? WHAT ABOUT US?

129
00:07:09,894 --> 00:07:11,863
WE MISSED FANCY, HOW DO YOU THINK WE FEEL?

130
00:07:11,896 --> 00:07:15,200
DO YOU THINK I CARE? BUT I'M SURE YOUR PARENTS WILL.

131
00:07:15,233 --> 00:07:17,302
I WANT YOU TO BOTH STAY THERE, DON'T GET INTO ANY TROUBLE.

132
00:07:17,335 --> 00:07:19,404
I'M TAKING YOU BOTH HOME.

133
00:07:20,171 --> 00:07:22,974
EMMA, IS EVERYTHING OKAY?

134
00:07:24,175 --> 00:07:26,945
I DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW TO SAY THIS.

135
00:07:26,978 --> 00:07:29,814
TRY. BECAUSE YOU'RE GIVING ME A HEART ATTACK.

136
00:07:29,848 --> 00:07:31,483
OKAY. MOM IS PREGNANT.

137
00:07:32,851 --> 00:07:36,054
AND SHE'S THINKING OF HAVING AN ABORTION.

138
00:07:41,426 --> 00:07:45,230
YEAH, I'M WORRIED ABOUT A STRIPPER, AND SHE'S PREGNANT.

139
00:07:45,263 --> 00:07:47,132
SNAKE, PLEASE, JUST LISTEN.

140
00:07:47,165 --> 00:07:49,100
EMMA, WHY ARE YOU HERE?

141
00:07:50,468 --> 00:07:51,936
WHY ARE YOU HERE TELLING ME THIS?

142
00:07:51,970 --> 00:07:53,605
BECAUSE YOU NEED TO KNOW.

143
00:07:53,638 --> 00:07:56,007
WHY YOU? WHY NOT YOUR MOM?

144
00:07:59,077 --> 00:08:00,478
WHY NOT YOUR MOM?!?

145
00:08:07,519 --> 00:08:08,353
I'M SORRY.

146
00:08:11,022 --> 00:08:14,459
BUT REALLY, WHAT KIND OF FAMILY IS THIS?

147
00:08:14,492 --> 00:08:18,563
YOU WAIT HERE AND JOEY WILL DRIVE YOU HOME.

148
00:08:24,235 --> 00:08:25,270
THIS IS JUST GREAT.

149
00:08:25,303 --> 00:08:28,072
IT'S MY WEDDING DAY AND THE GROOM HAS DISAPPEARED.

150
00:08:28,106 --> 00:08:30,475
HE'S NOT AT HIS APARTMENT OR AT JOEY'S.

151
00:08:30,508 --> 00:08:33,344
HE'S NOT ANSWERING HIS CELL.

152
00:08:36,181 --> 00:08:38,049
I'VE BEEN TRYING TO REACH YOU!

153
00:08:38,082 --> 00:08:38,950
BUT NOT YESTERDAY?

154
00:08:38,983 --> 00:08:40,118
NOT LAST NIGHT?

155
00:08:40,151 --> 00:08:42,487
NO, RIGHT. BECAUSE IT WAS EMMA WHO WAS LOOKING FOR ME.

156
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:43,121
WHAT?

157
00:08:44,355 --> 00:08:45,423
HOW DOES INFORMATION TRAVEL IN THIS FAMILY?

158
00:08:45,456 --> 00:08:48,293
OH, RIGHT - EVERY WHICH WAY EXCEPT FROM YOU TO ME.

159
00:08:48,326 --> 00:08:49,494
EMMA.

160
00:08:49,527 --> 00:08:50,562
NO, NOT EMMA! THIS IS ABOUT YOU AND ME!

161
00:08:50,595 --> 00:08:53,331
HOW COULD YOU NOT TELL ME THAT YOU'RE PREGNANT?!

162
00:08:53,364 --> 00:08:55,667
WE NEED TO TALK. BUT WE ARE NOT DOING IT HERE.

163
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:57,202
WE ARE GOING TO TALK ABOUT THIS RIGHT NOW.

164
00:08:57,235 --> 00:08:57,969
NOT HERE!

165
00:09:11,282 --> 00:09:14,619
♪ EVERYBODY WANTS SOMETHING, THEY'LL NEVER GIVE UP.

166
00:09:14,652 --> 00:09:15,954
♪ EVERYBODY WANTS SOMETHING.

167
00:09:15,987 --> 00:09:17,188
HEY, EM.

168
00:09:17,222 --> 00:09:19,490
THAT'S A DUMB SONG.

169
00:09:19,524 --> 00:09:20,592
IT'S SAVE THE HAIR TIME.

170
00:09:20,625 --> 00:09:24,295
IF WE'RE GONNA DO THIS, COME ON INSIDE.

171
00:09:24,329 --> 00:09:27,131
I'LL GIVE YOU THE SHIRT OFF MY BACK.

172
00:09:27,165 --> 00:09:29,100
HEY COME ON, I KNOW THINGS LOOK BAD.

173
00:09:29,133 --> 00:09:31,936
BUT WE GOT TO KEEP GOING AS IF THE WEDDING IS HAPPENING. HERE.

174
00:09:31,970 --> 00:09:33,104
AS IF IT'S HAPPENING?

175
00:09:33,137 --> 00:09:35,206
WHICH MEANS, IT'S NOT?

176
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:37,008
HEY COME ON, YOU DON'T KNOW THAT.

177
00:09:37,041 --> 00:09:39,310
JUST FORGET IT! I'VE RUINED EVERYTHING!

178
00:09:39,344 --> 00:09:40,945
EMMA, STOP BEING A BABY.

179
00:09:40,979 --> 00:09:43,114
JUST GET READY FOR THE WEDDING.

180
00:09:43,147 --> 00:09:45,450
MANNY, MIND YOUR OWN BUSINESS.

181
00:09:46,417 --> 00:09:48,019
OH, THAT'S FUNNY.

182
00:09:49,687 --> 00:09:52,290
DIDN'T I TELL YOU THE SAME THING, LAST NIGHT.

183
00:09:52,323 --> 00:09:53,958
I DID WHAT I FELT WAS RIGHT.

184
00:09:53,992 --> 00:09:56,261
YESTERDAY YOU FREAKED BECAUSE I TALKED TO SEAN.

185
00:09:56,294 --> 00:09:58,196
WHAT YOU DID, WAS SO MUCH WORSE.

186
00:09:58,229 --> 00:09:59,297
WELL, GEE, MANNY.

187
00:09:59,330 --> 00:10:01,299
THANKS FOR THE SUPPORT. WHAT A BEST FRIEND YOU ARE.

188
00:10:01,332 --> 00:10:02,500
GUYS...

189
00:10:02,533 --> 00:10:04,135
HEY, HEY, LADIES, LADIES, TAKE IT EASY.

190
00:10:04,168 --> 00:10:07,505
EVERYTHING'S GOING TO BE FINE. I KNOW IT.

191
00:10:07,538 --> 00:10:08,072
HEY!

192
00:10:09,707 --> 00:10:11,709
DON'T HIT THE CAR.

193
00:10:27,125 --> 00:10:28,426
I JUST FOUND OUT YESTERDAY.

194
00:10:28,459 --> 00:10:29,360
THEN YOU SHOULD'VE COME TO ME.

195
00:10:29,394 --> 00:10:30,328
I KNOW -

196
00:10:30,361 --> 00:10:33,131
TO HEAR IT FROM EMMA... AND AN ABORTION!?

197
00:10:33,164 --> 00:10:35,166
DO YOU REALLY THINK I'D SEND EMMA,

198
00:10:35,199 --> 00:10:37,135
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT, TO BREAK THE NEWS TO YOU?

199
00:10:37,168 --> 00:10:39,103
YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES IT'S LIKE YOU AND EMMA ARE THE COUPLE,

200
00:10:39,137 --> 00:10:39,604
NOT YOU AND ME.

201
00:10:39,637 --> 00:10:40,738
SHE'S MY DAUGHTER.

202
00:10:40,772 --> 00:10:43,174
YOU CAN'T EXPECT THAT I'LL JUST CHANGE OUR RELATIONSHIP.

203
00:10:43,207 --> 00:10:44,442
OF COURSE NOT.

204
00:10:44,475 --> 00:10:46,210
BUT IF THIS IS GONNA WORK, THEN SOME THINGS HAVE TO BE PRIVATE.

205
00:10:46,244 --> 00:10:47,378
I DON'T LIKE SECRETS, SNAKE.

206
00:10:47,412 --> 00:10:50,148
AND NEITHER DO I. TRUST ME.

207
00:10:51,149 --> 00:10:52,150
YOU SURE YOU'RE NOT HAVING DOUBTS?

208
00:10:52,183 --> 00:10:53,451
ARCHIE...

209
00:10:54,252 --> 00:10:56,054
THIS ALL HAPPENED PRETTY FAST.

210
00:10:56,087 --> 00:10:58,156
WE'VE KNOWN EACH OTHER SINCE JUNIOR HIGH.

211
00:10:58,189 --> 00:10:59,390
YEAH. AS FRIENDS.

212
00:11:03,161 --> 00:11:06,564
MAYBE WE'RE SUPPOSED TO KEEP IT THAT WAY.

213
00:11:11,803 --> 00:11:14,639
MAN, THESE WRESTLER'S TODAY.

214
00:11:16,808 --> 00:11:19,477
OH SEAN, YOU GOT TO CHECK THIS OUT, MAN.

215
00:11:19,510 --> 00:11:20,178
HI EMMA.

216
00:11:23,514 --> 00:11:24,515
EMMA? GREAT.

217
00:11:30,121 --> 00:11:32,156
SEAN, I'VE RUINED EVERYTHING.

218
00:11:32,190 --> 00:11:33,057
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

219
00:11:33,091 --> 00:11:34,158
I INTERFERED AND I RUINED EVERYTHING.

220
00:11:34,192 --> 00:11:37,195
AND I DON'T EVEN THINK THE WEDDING'S GONNA HAPPEN.

221
00:11:37,228 --> 00:11:38,563
AND EVERYONE'S GOING TO HATE ME.

222
00:11:38,596 --> 00:11:41,099
EMMA - YOU INTERFERING?

223
00:11:41,132 --> 00:11:43,301
IT'S NOTHING NEW.

224
00:11:43,334 --> 00:11:45,103
DO PEOPLE EVER HATE YOU FOR IT?

225
00:11:45,136 --> 00:11:46,304
MAYBE? BEHIND MY BACK.

226
00:11:46,337 --> 00:11:47,672
NO. NEVER.

227
00:11:49,474 --> 00:11:53,077
SO, DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT. IT'LL ALL WORK OUT.

228
00:11:53,111 --> 00:11:55,513
I REALLY, REALLY HOPE SO.

229
00:11:56,647 --> 00:11:57,582
SEAN.

230
00:12:01,152 --> 00:12:04,822
WHAT ABOUT WHAT I DID TO YOU? IT WAS -

231
00:12:05,757 --> 00:12:08,226
IT SUCKED, ALL RIGHT?

232
00:12:10,361 --> 00:12:13,097
MANNY SHOULD HAVE NEVER INVITED ME.

233
00:12:13,131 --> 00:12:14,766
I KNOW. I SHOULD HAVE.

234
00:12:19,270 --> 00:12:22,206
SEAN, IF THE WEDDING DOES HAPPEN?

235
00:12:24,809 --> 00:12:27,178
THE PARTY STARTS AT THREE.

236
00:12:27,912 --> 00:12:28,513
THANKS.

237
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:32,216
EMMA?!

238
00:12:34,619 --> 00:12:37,155
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR HAIR?

239
00:12:41,426 --> 00:12:43,494
YOU'RE - YOU'RE AN IDIOT.

240
00:12:44,629 --> 00:12:49,133
SO UM, I TAKE IT THAT WE HAVE A CHANGE OF PLANS TODAY?

241
00:12:54,272 --> 00:12:57,241
WHERE IS THE BRIDE?

242
00:12:57,275 --> 00:12:59,510
YEAH, NO BRIDE, NO GROOM.

243
00:12:59,544 --> 00:13:02,146
NO BRIDE'S MAID EITHER.

244
00:13:07,285 --> 00:13:10,221
HOW BAD DID YOUR PARENTS BUST YOU?

245
00:13:10,254 --> 00:13:11,889
ON A SCALE OF 1 TO 10?

246
00:13:12,523 --> 00:13:12,857
136.

247
00:13:15,193 --> 00:13:17,929
YEAH, I'M GROUNDED TILL DOOMSDAY.

248
00:13:17,962 --> 00:13:18,563
ME TOO.

249
00:13:19,130 --> 00:13:20,097
IF I WASN'T AN USHER,

250
00:13:20,131 --> 00:13:23,167
KATE WOULDN'T HAVE LET ME OUT OF THE HOUSE.

251
00:13:23,201 --> 00:13:23,701
HEY.

252
00:13:23,734 --> 00:13:25,436
OH, LOOK WHO IT IS.

253
00:13:25,470 --> 00:13:28,239
YOU HERE TO STEAL ANOTHER ONE OF OUR BRILLIANT IDEAS, CRAIG?

254
00:13:28,272 --> 00:13:30,274
NO, I'M HERE TO TELL YOU

255
00:13:30,308 --> 00:13:33,444
THAT SOMEONE VERY, FANCY JUST PULLED UP.

256
00:13:38,282 --> 00:13:38,850
FANCY?

257
00:13:38,883 --> 00:13:39,884
YEAH. FANCY.

258
00:13:52,830 --> 00:13:54,298
MADAME.

259
00:13:54,332 --> 00:13:55,466
YOU'RE HERE FOR THE GROOM?

260
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:56,567
NO, THE BRIDE.

261
00:13:56,601 --> 00:13:57,969
CHRISTINE DOES MY HAIR.

262
00:13:58,002 --> 00:13:59,270
OH, VERY GOOD.

263
00:13:59,303 --> 00:13:59,737
RIGHT THIS WAY.

264
00:13:59,770 --> 00:14:00,271
OH, THANK YOU.

265
00:14:00,304 --> 00:14:01,439
HE GETS LOST EASILY.

266
00:14:01,472 --> 00:14:02,406
ALLOW ME.

267
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:02,740
OH, THANK YOU.

268
00:14:02,773 --> 00:14:03,641
NO, ME.

269
00:14:03,674 --> 00:14:04,342
NO REALLY, ME!

270
00:14:04,375 --> 00:14:05,076
OKAY.

271
00:14:05,109 --> 00:14:07,578
REALLY, OKAY, THAT'S ENOUGH.

272
00:14:07,612 --> 00:14:08,880
I GOT IT.

273
00:14:11,249 --> 00:14:13,217
SPIKE'S JUST LATE, AS USUAL.

274
00:14:13,251 --> 00:14:15,620
YEAH, NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT.

275
00:14:15,653 --> 00:14:16,587
OKAY.

276
00:14:17,855 --> 00:14:18,356
RIGHT?

277
00:14:19,457 --> 00:14:22,226
OH, I JUST HOPE I CAN GET MY MONEY BACK FOR THE SUIT.

278
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:22,827
HUH!

279
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:23,261
JOEY!

280
00:14:24,762 --> 00:14:26,531
HEY! ARE THEY HERE YET?

281
00:14:26,564 --> 00:14:27,164
NOT YET.

282
00:14:27,198 --> 00:14:29,634
BUT I'M GLAD YOU'RE HERE.

283
00:14:29,667 --> 00:14:31,235
SORRY ABOUT EARLIER.

284
00:14:31,269 --> 00:14:33,271
SORRY ABOUT THE HAIR.

285
00:14:33,304 --> 00:14:34,805
LUCY, IF IT'S HUMANLY POSSIBLE,

286
00:14:34,839 --> 00:14:37,241
COULD YOU PLEASE TRY AND DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS HAIR?

287
00:14:37,275 --> 00:14:38,676
SURE, COME ON EMMA.

288
00:14:40,945 --> 00:14:43,281
I JUST CAN'T UNDERSTAND HOW IT HAPPENED.

289
00:14:43,314 --> 00:14:44,916
YOU WERE THERE.

290
00:14:44,949 --> 00:14:46,584
I MEAN, YOU'RE ON THE PILL.

291
00:14:46,617 --> 00:14:50,288
YEAH, WHICH IS 98 PERCENT EFFECTIVE.

292
00:14:50,321 --> 00:14:52,790
SO WE'RE JUST IN THE UNLUCKY TWO PERCENT.

293
00:14:52,823 --> 00:14:53,324
GREAT.

294
00:14:54,625 --> 00:14:58,429
SOME COUPLES WOULD THINK OF THIS AS A BLESSING.

295
00:14:58,462 --> 00:15:01,032
TOO BAD YOU'RE AGAINST KIDS.

296
00:15:01,065 --> 00:15:02,300
HEY, I NEVER SAID THAT.

297
00:15:02,333 --> 00:15:03,901
HOW ABOUT YESTERDAY?

298
00:15:03,935 --> 00:15:05,836
YOU SAID YOU HAVE TOO MUCH ON YOUR PLATE.

299
00:15:05,870 --> 00:15:08,039
WELL YEAH, I DO. I'VE GOT A LOT GOING ON RIGHT NOW.

300
00:15:08,072 --> 00:15:11,309
I'M MOVING IN, I'M GONNA BE A HUSBAND AND A STEP-DAD

301
00:15:11,342 --> 00:15:12,276
AND I'VE GOT A LOT -

302
00:15:12,310 --> 00:15:14,579
A LOT OF ADJUSTING, I KNOW.

303
00:15:15,079 --> 00:15:17,281
BUT LIFE DOESN'T WAIT FOR YOU TO 'GET ADJUSTED', SNAKE.

304
00:15:17,315 --> 00:15:18,649
IT JUST HAPPENS.

305
00:15:19,884 --> 00:15:22,386
I MEAN, LOOK AT EMMA.

306
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:24,755
SHE COULDN'T HAVE COME AT A WORSE TIME.

307
00:15:24,789 --> 00:15:26,457
BUT WAS IT A MISTAKE TO HAVE HER?

308
00:15:26,490 --> 00:15:26,757
NO.

309
00:15:28,326 --> 00:15:30,962
I WOULDN'T TRADE HER FOR ANYTHING.

310
00:15:33,064 --> 00:15:34,332
YOU'RE RIGHT.

311
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:38,302
YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.

312
00:15:46,344 --> 00:15:48,746
IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE THERE'S A LITTLE ONE GROWING IN THERE.

313
00:15:48,779 --> 00:15:52,450
THERE IS. SHE - OR HE IS GONNA BE BEAUTIFUL.

314
00:15:56,520 --> 00:16:00,791
SO, WHICH ONE OF US DOESN'T WANT THIS BABY ANYWAYS?

315
00:16:07,598 --> 00:16:08,466
IT IS A BIT LATE.

316
00:16:08,499 --> 00:16:10,001
THEY'LL BE HERE ANY SECOND.

317
00:16:10,034 --> 00:16:12,336
WE HAVE ANOTHER WEDDING COMING IN HERE IN AN HOUR.

318
00:16:12,370 --> 00:16:14,372
I'M AFRAID IF THEY'RE NOT HERE SOON,

319
00:16:14,405 --> 00:16:15,773
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO RESCHEDULE.

320
00:16:15,806 --> 00:16:18,109
NO, THEY'LL BE HERE. NOT TO WORRY.

321
00:16:18,142 --> 00:16:21,879
EMMA, THEY'LL BE FINE, THEY'LL MAKE IT.

322
00:16:46,037 --> 00:16:46,637
AHHH!

323
00:16:50,808 --> 00:16:51,275
EMMA!

324
00:16:51,308 --> 00:16:51,942
HEY!

325
00:16:51,976 --> 00:16:53,711
HEY MOM, SNAKE.

326
00:16:53,744 --> 00:16:54,812
WE'VE GOT A WEDDING TO GO TO. COME ON.

327
00:16:54,845 --> 00:16:57,081
COME ON, WE'RE GETTING MARRIED!

328
00:16:57,114 --> 00:17:01,352
HELLO! HEY... SORRY WE'RE LATE, EVERYBODY.

329
00:17:03,921 --> 00:17:07,124
DO YOU, CHRISTINE NELSON, TAKE ARCHIBALD RUPERT SIMPSON

330
00:17:07,158 --> 00:17:09,493
TO BE YOUR LAWFULLY WEDDED HUSBAND?

331
00:17:09,527 --> 00:17:10,461
I DO.

332
00:17:11,629 --> 00:17:12,763
AND DO YOU, ARCHIBALD RUPERT SIMPSON,

333
00:17:12,797 --> 00:17:17,168
TAKE CHRISTINE NELSON TO BE YOUR LAWFULLY WEDDED WIFE?

334
00:17:17,201 --> 00:17:17,802
I DO.

335
00:17:18,936 --> 00:17:20,705
THEN WITH THE POWER VESTED IN ME,

336
00:17:20,738 --> 00:17:22,907
I NOW PRONOUNCE YOU HUSBAND AND WIFE.

337
00:17:22,940 --> 00:17:25,009
YOU MAY NOW KISS THE BRIDE.

338
00:17:26,043 --> 00:17:26,644
(Clapping)

339
00:17:26,677 --> 00:17:28,679
WOO HOO HOO!

340
00:17:32,717 --> 00:17:33,651
YEAH!

341
00:17:38,155 --> 00:17:39,123
WOO HOO!

342
00:17:46,931 --> 00:17:48,899
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR COMING, EVERYBODY.

343
00:17:48,933 --> 00:17:50,067
THANK YOU.

344
00:17:54,038 --> 00:17:55,840
CONNIE! YOU MADE IT.

345
00:17:55,873 --> 00:17:58,642
OH, OF COURSE I MADE IT.

346
00:17:58,676 --> 00:18:00,111
I WOULDN'T MISS IT FOR THE WORLD.

347
00:18:00,144 --> 00:18:02,580
THIS IS MY HUSBAND, ARCHIE.

348
00:18:02,613 --> 00:18:03,914
ARCHIE, HUH?

349
00:18:03,948 --> 00:18:07,885
HONEY? YOU DON'T LOOK LIKE AN ARCHIE TO ME.

350
00:18:07,918 --> 00:18:08,652
CONGRATS.

351
00:18:10,888 --> 00:18:12,823
HONEY, IS EVERYTHING OKAY?

352
00:18:12,857 --> 00:18:13,657
UH, NO.

353
00:18:16,761 --> 00:18:17,895
WHAT IS IT?

354
00:18:17,928 --> 00:18:20,765
I UM... HOW DO I SAY THIS?

355
00:18:21,165 --> 00:18:25,870
JOEY SORT OF ARRANGED FOR A STRIPPER TO COME THE STAG.

356
00:18:26,137 --> 00:18:30,207
AS A MATTER OF FACT - IT WAS FANCY. CONNIE.

357
00:18:31,509 --> 00:18:32,843
(Laughing)

358
00:18:33,577 --> 00:18:34,512
YOU'RE NOT MAD?

359
00:18:34,545 --> 00:18:36,747
FANCY CAN DO WHAT SHE WANTS WITH HER BODY.

360
00:18:36,781 --> 00:18:38,783
IT'S HER BUSINESS.

361
00:18:39,950 --> 00:18:41,152
WHAT A RELIEF.

362
00:18:41,185 --> 00:18:44,789
WAIT A SECOND. I'M COOL WITH HOW FANCY MAKES HER LIVING...

363
00:18:44,822 --> 00:18:45,823
I SENSE A 'BUT' COMING.

364
00:18:45,856 --> 00:18:47,691
BUT I'M NOT COOL WITH MY HUSBAND

365
00:18:47,725 --> 00:18:51,629
BEING ONE OF THOSE PATHETIC LOSERS WHO GOES TO STRIPPERS.

366
00:18:51,662 --> 00:18:53,931
ESPECIALLY WHEN I KNOW THE STRIPPER.

367
00:18:53,964 --> 00:18:54,932
GROSS.

368
00:18:54,965 --> 00:18:57,835
POINT TAKEN. NEVER AGAIN.

369
00:18:57,868 --> 00:19:01,105
WAIT A MINUTE. WHAT IF PEOPLE FIND OUT?

370
00:19:01,138 --> 00:19:03,007
WELL, THEY WON'T. IT'LL BE OUR LITTLE SECRET.

371
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:04,608
THAT'S WHAT YOU THINK...

372
00:19:04,642 --> 00:19:05,409
GIRLS?

373
00:19:05,442 --> 00:19:07,044
NO, NO, NO, DON'T - DON'T YOU -

374
00:19:07,077 --> 00:19:09,780
IT'S TIME TO TOSS THE BOUQUET!

375
00:19:10,214 --> 00:19:13,217
COME ON. WHO WILL BE THE LUCKY GIRL?

376
00:19:24,195 --> 00:19:26,897
LOOKS LIKE I'M THE LUCKY GIRL.

377
00:19:27,898 --> 00:19:28,966
WICKED CATCH.

378
00:19:29,834 --> 00:19:30,100
SORRY.

379
00:19:30,134 --> 00:19:30,935
WHAT?

380
00:19:30,968 --> 00:19:33,604
IT ACTUALLY HAS TO BE CAUGHT BY A GIRL.

381
00:19:33,637 --> 00:19:35,840
BUT I HAD SO MANY PLANS.

382
00:19:35,873 --> 00:19:37,942
EXCUSE ME, WOULD YOU MIND PUTTING THAT DOWN FOR ME.

383
00:19:37,975 --> 00:19:39,143
THANK YOU.

384
00:19:39,176 --> 00:19:40,144
DO TELL.

385
00:19:40,177 --> 00:19:42,713
I WILL. BUT YOU HAVE TO DANCE WITH ME FIRST.

386
00:19:42,746 --> 00:19:43,714
