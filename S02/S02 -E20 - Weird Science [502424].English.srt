1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,403
TODAY WAS SO CRAZY. MELISSA CALL IN SICK AGAIN.

2
00:00:05,437 --> 00:00:08,973
I FORGOT POOR MRS. HIRSCH UNDER THE DRYER. FOR AN HOUR.

3
00:00:09,007 --> 00:00:10,709
IT'S TIME TO FOUND A JUNIOR STYLIST.

4
00:00:10,742 --> 00:00:12,010
I KNOW.

5
00:00:20,752 --> 00:00:22,053
SO. EM.

6
00:00:23,188 --> 00:00:25,590
WHAT'RE YOUR BIG PLANS FOR THE WEEKEND?

7
00:00:25,623 --> 00:00:27,092
GOT ANY 'HOT DATES'?

8
00:00:27,926 --> 00:00:29,327
NO, MR. SIMPSON.

9
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:32,697
EMMA'S BEEN WORKING REALLY HARD ON HER SCIENCE FAIR PROJECT.

10
00:00:32,731 --> 00:00:35,667
OH GREAT! WHAT'S IT ON, AGAIN?

11
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:37,969
THE EFFECT OF A HEALTHY BREAKFAST ON SCHOOL PERFORMANCE.

12
00:00:38,002 --> 00:00:39,904
THE BETTER YOU EAT, THE BETTER YOU PERFORM.

13
00:00:39,938 --> 00:00:42,107
OH THAT'S VERY IMPRESSIVE.

14
00:00:42,774 --> 00:00:44,609
THANK YOU MR. SIMPSON.

15
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:51,883
EMMA, MR. SIMPSON IS FINE FOR SCHOOL

16
00:00:53,251 --> 00:00:58,189
BUT WHEN WE'RE HERE - I'D LIKE IT IF YOU CALLED ME ARCHIE.

17
00:00:59,891 --> 00:01:04,229
WOULD YOU PASS THE KUNG PAO... MR. SIMPSON?

18
00:01:04,262 --> 00:01:06,464
♪ WHAT EVER IT TAKES

19
00:01:08,099 --> 00:01:10,935

HOW MANY?

29
00:01:54,913 --> 00:01:57,816
FORTY-EIGHT. FOURTEEN MORE THAN YOU DID LAST WEEK,

30
00:01:57,849 --> 00:02:00,018
WHEN YOU WERE EATING JUNK.

31
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:05,623
EVERY TIME I TURN AROUND, THERE HE IS. AT HOME, AT SCHOOL.

32
00:02:05,657 --> 00:02:07,592
CAN YOU EVER GET TOO MUCH MR. SIMPSON?

33
00:02:07,625 --> 00:02:08,259
UH, YEAH?

34
00:02:09,227 --> 00:02:10,662
HE CAME OVER AGAIN FOR DINNER LAST NIGHT -

35
00:02:10,695 --> 00:02:11,996
AND GUESS WHAT HE ASKED ME.

36
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:13,031
WHAT?

37
00:02:13,064 --> 00:02:16,067
IF I HAD A 'HOT DATES' THIS WEEK-END.

38
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:17,669
EW! GROSS!

39
00:02:17,702 --> 00:02:19,103
YOU WANT GROSSER?

40
00:02:19,137 --> 00:02:23,141
HE WANTS ME TO CALL HIM BY HIS FIRST NAME - ARCHIE.

41
00:02:23,174 --> 00:02:24,943
DOES THAT MAKE YOUR MOM BETTY?

42
00:02:24,976 --> 00:02:29,781
I ALWAYS THOUGHT SHE WAS MORE OF A VERONICA TYPE.

43
00:02:32,350 --> 00:02:36,287
WE'D HAVE FUN ON A DATE, GUARANTEED.

44
00:02:36,321 --> 00:02:38,189
ALL I NEED IS YOUR PHONE NUMBER.

45
00:02:38,223 --> 00:02:44,762
JIMMY YOUR EX IS MY NEW BEST FRIEND. YOU'RE CUTE, BUT NO.

46
00:02:44,796 --> 00:02:46,698
MAY I HAVE YOUR ATTENTION PLEASE.

47
00:02:46,731 --> 00:02:48,032
SENIOR STUDENTS PLEASE NOTE

48
00:02:48,066 --> 00:02:53,304
THAT GYM CLASSES ARE CANCELED TODAY FOR JUNIOR SCIENCE FAIR.

49
00:02:53,338 --> 00:02:55,240
STORY OF MY LIFE, EH.

50
00:02:55,273 --> 00:02:56,741
COME ON, LET'S GO.

51
00:02:57,642 --> 00:03:00,178
CAN'T. MY BAT. IT'S WOODEN.

52
00:03:03,381 --> 00:03:06,317
SORRY, MY EARS WERE PLUGGED. SORRY.

53
00:03:07,285 --> 00:03:08,753
I HAVE A BONER.

54
00:03:14,993 --> 00:03:16,227
AND IT'S BEEN LIKE THIS ALL WEEK.

55
00:03:16,261 --> 00:03:18,263
A GIRL WALKS BY AND BAM!

56
00:03:20,198 --> 00:03:24,035
IT'S ALL BECAUSE OF EMMA'S STUPID SCIENCE PROJECT.

57
00:03:24,068 --> 00:03:26,170
WHAT DOES THE PROJECT HAVE TO DO WITH IT?

58
00:03:26,204 --> 00:03:29,107
SHE MADE ME EAT GRANOLA. AND FRUIT.

59
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:32,176
BANANAS DON'T GIVE YOU BONERS. HORMONES DO.

60
00:03:32,210 --> 00:03:35,113
ALL I KNOW IS I ATE SOME HEALTHY FOOD

61
00:03:35,146 --> 00:03:37,649
AND I'M LIKE THE SEX SUPERMAN.

62
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:40,652
YOU'RE A SUPER FREAK. LET'S GO.

63
00:03:40,685 --> 00:03:43,855
JIMMY, I'M STILL IN THE RED.

64
00:03:45,156 --> 00:03:47,992
I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M DOING- HERE.

65
00:03:50,194 --> 00:03:52,897
A BINDER-BONER-SHIELD. THANKS.

66
00:03:57,368 --> 00:04:00,371
ALL RIGHT, THE FAIR IS TOMORROW AT NINE SHARP.

67
00:04:00,405 --> 00:04:04,943
WELL, IT LOOKS LIKE SOME OF YOU ALMOST FINISHED --

68
00:04:04,976 --> 00:04:07,979
AND LOOKING AROUND, LOOKS LIKE SOME OF YOU ARE LAGGING BEHIND.

69
00:04:08,012 --> 00:04:09,380
DOES ANY ONE NEED ANY HELP?

70
00:04:09,414 --> 00:04:12,083
YES PLEASE, MS. HATZILAKOS.

71
00:04:16,154 --> 00:04:18,222
EM, YOUR PROJECT IS GONNA BE SO AWESOME.

72
00:04:18,256 --> 00:04:20,959
I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW MUCH WORK YOU DID.

73
00:04:20,992 --> 00:04:22,927
YOU ARE SO GONNA WIN.

74
00:04:23,227 --> 00:04:24,228
UM, NO.

75
00:04:24,262 --> 00:04:26,197
MY PROJECT ON THE EFFECTS OF LIGHT DEPRIVATION

76
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:27,865
ON HOUSEHOLD PLANTS

77
00:04:27,899 --> 00:04:32,637
IS SO DETAILED, SO THOROUGH, IT IMPRESSES EVEN ME. SORRY!

78
00:04:33,037 --> 00:04:34,739
DON'T LET HER BUG YOU.

79
00:04:34,772 --> 00:04:36,240
IT'S NOT HER. IT'S MY PROJECT.

80
00:04:36,274 --> 00:04:37,809
IT'S NOT WORKING.

81
00:04:37,842 --> 00:04:40,345
TWO OF THE KIDS DID BETTER EATING JUNK FOOD.

82
00:04:40,378 --> 00:04:42,013
REALLY? WHO?

83
00:04:42,046 --> 00:04:44,882
SPINNER MASON. AND GUESS WHO ELSE?

84
00:04:49,988 --> 00:04:50,922
SORRY.

85
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:07,238
WOW, WHAT'D I DO NOW?

86
00:05:07,271 --> 00:05:08,206
YOU DID BETTER AFTER EATING JUNK.

87
00:05:08,239 --> 00:05:10,842
YOU FAKED MY TESTS AND RUINED MY PROJECT.

88
00:05:10,875 --> 00:05:12,410
MOI? WHY WOULD I?

89
00:05:12,443 --> 00:05:14,912
I ONLY DID YOUR STUPID PROJECT FOR THE FREE FOOD.

90
00:05:14,946 --> 00:05:16,848
WELL, THERE'S NO OTHER EXPLANATION.

91
00:05:16,881 --> 00:05:19,784
SURE THERE IS. THE HEALTH FOOD YOU EAT FOR BREAKFAST STINKS.

92
00:05:19,817 --> 00:05:22,020
YEAH, AND IT'S TRYING TO ESCAPE.

93
00:05:22,053 --> 00:05:22,987
(BURPING)

94
00:05:28,993 --> 00:05:30,228
I'M NOT EATING ANY MORE GRANOLA.

95
00:05:30,261 --> 00:05:31,229
YOU DON'T HAVE TO.

96
00:05:31,262 --> 00:05:33,031
YOU ALREADY MESSED UP MY PROJECT.

97
00:05:33,064 --> 00:05:34,432
YOU MESSED UP MY LIFE.

98
00:05:34,465 --> 00:05:38,436
YOUR HEALTH FOOD UNLEASHED THE BEAST WITHIN.

99
00:05:38,469 --> 00:05:40,071
SPINNER OPEN YOUR EYES.

100
00:05:40,104 --> 00:05:41,172
SORRY, ELLIE.

101
00:05:46,244 --> 00:05:48,112
I HAVE TO GO NOW.

102
00:05:48,146 --> 00:05:51,149
WAIT. I WANTED TO GO OVER THESE RESULTS WITH YOU.

103
00:05:51,182 --> 00:05:52,016
SPINNER -?

104
00:05:57,288 --> 00:05:58,790
YOU WANT SOME ICE CREAM.

105
00:05:58,823 --> 00:05:59,290
YEAH.

106
00:05:59,323 --> 00:06:00,258
YEAH?

107
00:06:07,031 --> 00:06:10,134
SO. HOW'S THE PROJECT?

108
00:06:10,168 --> 00:06:12,336
HOW'S IT LOOK? A DISASTER.

109
00:06:12,370 --> 00:06:14,105
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

110
00:06:14,138 --> 00:06:15,940
JT AND SPINNER ARE THE MATTER.

111
00:06:15,973 --> 00:06:18,042
MY HYPOTHESIS FELL APART.

112
00:06:20,144 --> 00:06:24,315
YOU KNOW EINSTEIN SAID IMAGINATION IS MORE KEY THAN KNOWLEDGE.

113
00:06:24,348 --> 00:06:27,819
MAYBE YOU NEED TO GET A LITTLE CREATIVE.

114
00:06:27,852 --> 00:06:29,454
LOOK AT THINGS FROM ANOTHER ANGLE.

115
00:06:29,487 --> 00:06:31,222
GEE, THAT'S HELPFUL.

116
00:06:31,255 --> 00:06:34,792
HOW HANDY TO HAVE YOU RIGHT HERE IN MY HOUSE!

117
00:06:39,063 --> 00:06:44,769
WELL. GUESS I'LL LEAVE YOU TO IT THEN. GOOD NIGHT, EMMA.

118
00:07:09,127 --> 00:07:14,198
MR. RADITCH? I GIVE YOU - THE WOMAN OF THE FUTURE.

119
00:07:15,133 --> 00:07:17,201
DO I WANT TO KNOW WHAT THIS IS?

120
00:07:17,235 --> 00:07:20,238
IT'S A REPLACEMENT FOR THE SILICONE IN BREAST IMPLANTS.

121
00:07:20,271 --> 00:07:22,140
ONE-HUNDRED PERCENT NATURAL.

122
00:07:22,173 --> 00:07:24,575
MADE OF WATER, FLOWER AND LARD.

123
00:07:26,611 --> 00:07:29,247
MR. RADITCH, WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE MY PROJECT?

124
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:30,214
YES PLEASE.

125
00:07:31,616 --> 00:07:34,152
SURVEILLANCE: FRIEND OR FOE?

126
00:07:35,019 --> 00:07:38,156
MY PROJECT WAS GONNA BE SO GOOD.

127
00:07:40,358 --> 00:07:42,994
CHOCOLATE? IN THE MORNING?

128
00:07:43,027 --> 00:07:47,498
I KNOW IT'S NO GOOD FOR ME. BUT IT TASTES LIKE... HAPPY!

129
00:07:51,135 --> 00:07:53,070
MANY, WHAT DID YOU SAY?

130
00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:59,110
I TASTES LIKE HAPPY. WHY?

131
00:07:59,143 --> 00:08:01,212
MANNY, YOU ARE BRILLIANT!

132
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:03,915
THANK YOU.

133
00:08:28,139 --> 00:08:29,907
HOUR ONE-HUNDRED AND FORTY SEVEN.

134
00:08:29,941 --> 00:08:32,076
NOTICEABLE LACK OF GREEN ON THE FERN.

135
00:08:32,109 --> 00:08:34,011
HOUR ONE-HUNDRED AND FORTY EIGHT.

136
00:08:34,045 --> 00:08:36,247
EVEN THE CACTUS ARE BEGINNING TO DRYING UP.

137
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:38,082
HOUR ONE-HUNDRED --

138
00:08:38,382 --> 00:08:39,650
THANK YOU, LIBERTY. THAT'LL DO.

139
00:08:39,684 --> 00:08:41,319
BUT THERE'S FIFTY-TWO MORE HOURS -

140
00:08:41,352 --> 00:08:42,453
I'M SURE THERE ARE.

141
00:08:42,486 --> 00:08:45,423
IF WE ONLY HAD ENOUGH TIME.

142
00:08:47,658 --> 00:08:50,127
TWO OF HER SUBJECTS HAVE IRREGULAR RESULTS.

143
00:08:50,161 --> 00:08:51,996
PLUS SHE'S NOT EVEN HERE.

144
00:08:52,029 --> 00:08:52,830
WAIT.

145
00:08:54,031 --> 00:08:56,601
SORRY. LAST MINUTE BURST OF INSPIRATION.

146
00:08:56,634 --> 00:08:59,003
NO PROBLEM AT ALL.

147
00:08:59,036 --> 00:09:00,504
YOU'RE JUDGING?

148
00:09:00,538 --> 00:09:05,476
YUP. I CAN'T WAIT TO HEAR ABOUT YOUR INSPIRATION. SO GO AHEAD.

149
00:09:05,509 --> 00:09:06,611
OKAY. FOR MY PROJECT,

150
00:09:06,644 --> 00:09:08,579
I SET OUT TO PROVE THAT HEALTHY FOOD IS GOOD FOR YOU.

151
00:09:08,613 --> 00:09:11,649
BUT AS SCIENTISTS, WE MUST REMEMBER THE HUMAN FACTOR.

152
00:09:11,682 --> 00:09:13,317
TAKE JT YORKE FOR EXAMPLE.

153
00:09:13,351 --> 00:09:14,585
HIS RESULTS THREW ME.

154
00:09:14,619 --> 00:09:17,188
UNTIL I REALIZED THAT CHOCOLATE AND BURRITOS MAKE HIM HAPPY.

155
00:09:17,221 --> 00:09:19,223
BETTER MOOD? BETTER PERFORMANCE.

156
00:09:19,257 --> 00:09:23,394
AND WHAT ABOUT SPINNER MASON? HOW DO YOU EXPLAIN HIS RESULTS?

157
00:09:23,427 --> 00:09:28,165
MARGIN OF ERROR - IT MAKES SENSE, SINCE IT'S SPINNER...

158
00:09:28,199 --> 00:09:30,601
IT'S A VERY ORIGINAL PROJECT.

159
00:09:45,182 --> 00:09:46,517
OH I LOVE THOSE GIRLS.

160
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:50,154
YEAH ME TOO. I REALLY LOVE THEM.

161
00:09:51,289 --> 00:09:53,991
STILL IN THE RED ZONE?

162
00:09:56,227 --> 00:09:57,728
WHAT'RE YOU DOING?

163
00:10:00,131 --> 00:10:01,699
FIGHTING THE HEALTH FOOD MOLECULES.

164
00:10:01,732 --> 00:10:04,468
CHEMICALS AND PRESERVATIVES ARE THE ANTIDOTE.

165
00:10:04,502 --> 00:10:06,370
IT'S NOT HEALTH FOOD MOLECULES GIVING YOU BONERS,

166
00:10:06,404 --> 00:10:08,105
YOU REALIZE THAT.

167
00:10:08,139 --> 00:10:09,040
HOW DO YOU KNOW?

168
00:10:09,073 --> 00:10:11,142
BECAUSE THAT'S STUPID.

169
00:10:11,175 --> 00:10:12,143
YOU'RE STUPID.

170
00:10:13,411 --> 00:10:16,147
ALL I'VE GOTTA DO IS GET BACK MY CHEMICAL-ENRICHED METABOLISM

171
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:18,516
AND I'LL BE MY OLD SELF.

172
00:10:18,549 --> 00:10:24,288
WE'RE WAITING FOR YOU TO BEGIN. COULD YOU TWO MOVE ANY SLOWER?

173
00:10:25,323 --> 00:10:27,458
MAYBE ONE DAY, PEOPLE WILL REALIZE

174
00:10:27,491 --> 00:10:31,495
THAT THE WOLF IS ACTUALLY OUR FRIEND. THANK YOU.

175
00:10:32,096 --> 00:10:34,065
CONGRATULATIONS ONCE AGAIN TO NADIA,

176
00:10:34,098 --> 00:10:37,201
FOR WINNING FIRST PRIZE IN THE GRADE SEVEN CLASS.

177
00:10:37,234 --> 00:10:39,303
AND NOW, OUR FINAL AWARD.

178
00:10:39,804 --> 00:10:43,174
JUNIOR SCIENCE FAIR FIRST PRIZE.

179
00:10:45,109 --> 00:10:48,212
HOPE THE ENGRAVER SPELLED MY NAME RIGHT. EXCUSE ME.

180
00:10:48,245 --> 00:10:50,181
AND IT GOES TO EMMA NELSON

181
00:10:50,214 --> 00:10:53,718
FOR MIND/BODY CONNECTION.

182
00:10:57,488 --> 00:10:59,023
CONGRATULATIONS.

183
00:11:01,826 --> 00:11:03,761
ALRIGHT EMMA!

184
00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:07,732
YOU'RE SO JEALOUS.

185
00:11:08,232 --> 00:11:13,070
I'M NOT JEALOUS. I'M APPALLED. TEACHER'S PET WINS AGAIN...

186
00:11:18,576 --> 00:11:22,680
I'VE BEEN THINKING. YOU KNOW ABOUT MY CONDITION.

187
00:11:22,713 --> 00:11:23,814
DO WE HAVE TO TALK ABOUT THIS?

188
00:11:23,848 --> 00:11:25,683
OKAY LOOK IT'S NOT ALL BAD.

189
00:11:25,716 --> 00:11:29,720
INCONVENIENT, YES. BUT IT DOES HAVE AN UPSIDE.

190
00:11:29,754 --> 00:11:30,821
WHAT?

191
00:11:31,856 --> 00:11:33,591
WELL, WHATEVER'S GIVING ME BONERS,

192
00:11:33,624 --> 00:11:37,461
IS ALSO TURNING ME INTO A MAJOR CHICK MAGNET.

193
00:11:41,832 --> 00:11:45,269
GIRLS HAVE BEEN LOOKING AT ME, DIFFERENT.

194
00:11:45,302 --> 00:11:47,705
DIFFERENT. LIKE YOU'RE CRAZY.

195
00:11:50,708 --> 00:11:52,710
NOW TAKE THIS.

196
00:11:53,411 --> 00:11:55,513
SHEILA LET ME TAKE THIS FOR FREE.

197
00:11:55,546 --> 00:11:58,682
SHE EVEN COMPLIMENTED ME ON MY ENSEMBLE.

198
00:12:06,524 --> 00:12:07,591
WHAT'S YOUR POINT?

199
00:12:07,625 --> 00:12:10,594
THAT THE ENTIRE FEMALE RACE IS A SLAVE FOR SPINNER.

200
00:12:10,628 --> 00:12:14,799
SO WHY FIGHT IT? FRUIT AND ONLY FRUIT FROM NOW ON!

201
00:12:26,811 --> 00:12:30,347
(WHISTLE) OKAY. WE ALL HAD FUN AT THE SCIENCE FAIR,

202
00:12:30,381 --> 00:12:32,116
BUT BACK TO BUSINESS.

203
00:12:32,683 --> 00:12:33,751
MOTHERBOARDS.

204
00:12:34,952 --> 00:12:39,323
NOW, AS YOU CAN SEE, THIS ONE HAS NO FRONT-SIDE BUS.

205
00:13:07,384 --> 00:13:09,887
OH NO. OH NO. OH NO. OH NO.

206
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:10,621
MANNY!

207
00:13:11,288 --> 00:13:12,790
OH, SORRY.

208
00:13:14,458 --> 00:13:15,192
OH LORDY.

209
00:13:16,594 --> 00:13:17,862
EMMA WHAT'S WRONG?

210
00:13:17,895 --> 00:13:20,831
DON'T LOOK AT YOUR E-MAIL.

211
00:13:28,939 --> 00:13:34,411
MISS SANTOS. YOU WILL SEE ME IMMEDIATELY AFTER CLASS.

212
00:13:41,719 --> 00:13:43,587
THANK YOU.

213
00:13:45,689 --> 00:13:47,558
I'LL BE CALLING YOU.

214
00:13:51,795 --> 00:13:53,797
ELLIE'S NUMBER!

215
00:13:58,802 --> 00:14:02,606
JIMMY. I'M A LOVER NOT A FIGHTER.

216
00:14:03,807 --> 00:14:06,644
OKAY, OKAY LISTEN. EVOLUTION CLASS?

217
00:14:06,677 --> 00:14:08,312
CHARLES DERWIN SAID THAT

218
00:14:08,345 --> 00:14:09,947
MANKIND MUST SPREAD HIS SEED TO SURVIVE.

219
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:14,251
SO DATING ELLIE IS JUST PART OF MY HUMAN DUTY.

220
00:14:14,285 --> 00:14:17,688
ITS DARWIN. THE GUY'S NAME WAS DARWIN. THERE IS NO DERWIN.

221
00:14:17,721 --> 00:14:19,523
WHATEVER.

222
00:14:19,990 --> 00:14:22,927
HAVE YOU CONSIDERED CHANGING YOUR DIET?

223
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:24,461
BECAUSE WITH A LITTLE BIT OF HEALTH FOOD

224
00:14:24,495 --> 00:14:26,764
THIS COULD HAVE BEEN YOURS.

225
00:14:31,702 --> 00:14:33,737
AND NOW I HAVE TO WRITE A THOUSAND WORD ESSAY

226
00:14:33,771 --> 00:14:35,439
ON INTERNET PRIVACY!

227
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:38,876
SO IT'S TRUE?

228
00:14:39,376 --> 00:14:41,879
SIMPSON IS DATING MY MOM. YES.

229
00:14:42,479 --> 00:14:45,382
AND NOW EVERYONE KNOWS. EMBARRASSING.

230
00:14:45,416 --> 00:14:47,851
OF COURSE, I WAS A VICTIM OF GOSSIP LAST YEAR.

231
00:14:47,885 --> 00:14:49,420
SO I SYMPATHIZE.

232
00:14:49,453 --> 00:14:50,387
THANKS, LIBERTY.

233
00:14:50,421 --> 00:14:51,355
YOU'RE WELCOME.

234
00:14:51,388 --> 00:14:53,557
NOW LET'S TALK ABOUT WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO.

235
00:14:53,591 --> 00:14:54,725
ABOUT WHAT?

236
00:14:54,758 --> 00:14:56,560
THERE WAS A JUDGING BIAS IN YOUR FAVOUR.

237
00:14:56,594 --> 00:14:58,495
SIMPSON'S DATING YOUR MOM.

238
00:14:58,529 --> 00:14:58,796
SO?

239
00:14:59,496 --> 00:15:02,499
SO HIS BIAS DOESN'T BOTHER YOU?

240
00:15:02,533 --> 00:15:03,867
DON'T LISTEN TO HER, EM.

241
00:15:03,901 --> 00:15:06,604
SHE CAN MAKE UP HER OWN MIND. IT SHOULD BOTHER YOU.

242
00:15:06,637 --> 00:15:09,440
BECAUSE YOU, EMMA NELSON, ARE A WOMAN OF CONSCIENCE.

243
00:15:09,473 --> 00:15:12,810
ONE SIMPLE SOLUTION - TURN IN THE AWARD.

244
00:15:21,352 --> 00:15:22,853
MR. SIMPSON?

245
00:15:22,886 --> 00:15:25,522
I KNOW. WHAT HAPPENED WITH MANNY WAS UNFORTUNATE.

246
00:15:25,556 --> 00:15:26,790
YEAH IT WAS A MISTAKE.

247
00:15:26,824 --> 00:15:28,592
WE'RE BOTH SORRY ABOUT IT.

248
00:15:28,626 --> 00:15:30,761
OKAY. FAIR ENOUGH.

249
00:15:31,862 --> 00:15:33,831
ANYTHING ELSE, EM?

250
00:15:33,864 --> 00:15:35,799
SO I DON'T GET PUNISHED? JUST MANNY?

251
00:15:35,833 --> 00:15:36,834
SHE SENT THE EMAIL -

252
00:15:36,867 --> 00:15:38,869
YEAH BUT I TOLD HER ABOUT YOU AND MOM.

253
00:15:38,902 --> 00:15:42,640
THERE'S NOTHING TO HIDE, EM. WHAT'S ALL THIS ABOUT?

254
00:15:42,673 --> 00:15:43,607
KIDS ARE TALKING.

255
00:15:43,641 --> 00:15:45,909
THAT I WON THE AWARD BECAUSE OF FAVORITISM.

256
00:15:45,943 --> 00:15:47,011
WHAT?

257
00:15:47,044 --> 00:15:48,779
WELL IT'S TRUE. WHEN GUYS LIKE YOU DATE SINGLE MOMS

258
00:15:48,812 --> 00:15:51,815
THEY ALWAYS TRY TO BRIBE THE KIDS.

259
00:15:51,849 --> 00:15:52,916
GUYS LIKE ME?

260
00:15:57,154 --> 00:15:59,356
WE NEED TO DISCUSS THIS - LATER.

261
00:15:59,390 --> 00:16:01,091
NO, WE'RE GONNA DISCUSS THIS NOW!

262
00:16:01,125 --> 00:16:02,860
EMMA CLASS IS ABOUT TO START.

263
00:16:02,893 --> 00:16:05,462
I DON'T CARE! YOU'RE BIASED! JUST ADMIT IT ARCHIE!

264
00:16:05,496 --> 00:16:07,598
EMMA, YOU WON THE AWARD ON YOUR OWN MERITS.

265
00:16:07,631 --> 00:16:08,832
THE RUNNER-UP, LIBERTY VAN ZANDT,

266
00:16:08,866 --> 00:16:10,834
MADE A STRONG EFFORT BUT THE JUDGES THOUGHT IT LACKED FLAIR.

267
00:16:10,868 --> 00:16:12,870
YOURS WAS EXCITING AND ORIGINAL.

268
00:16:12,903 --> 00:16:15,639
ORIGINAL, EXCIDING. OF COURSE, YOU'RE GOING TO SAY.

269
00:16:15,673 --> 00:16:17,841
BECAUSE IT'S THE TRUTH!

270
00:16:17,875 --> 00:16:20,477
I'M NOT THE ONLY ONE THAT FELT THAT WAY.

271
00:16:20,511 --> 00:16:22,780
LOOK AT THE JUDGING SHEETS.

272
00:16:27,551 --> 00:16:29,386
OK. ENOUGH TIME LEFT FOR IMPROV!

273
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:31,955
WE NEED TWO VOLUNTEERS. NOMINEES?

274
00:16:33,724 --> 00:16:35,893
I'M GONNA GO WITH PAIGE...

275
00:16:36,994 --> 00:16:37,995
AND SPINNER!

276
00:16:40,998 --> 00:16:44,601
DON'T! YOU KNOW I CAN'T! JIMMY!

277
00:16:48,706 --> 00:16:49,606
WHAT'S THE SITUATION?

278
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:53,110
SITUATION. SPINNER'S DELIVERING A PACKAGE.

279
00:16:54,511 --> 00:16:58,048
AND PAIGE IS A LONELY HOUSEWIFE. VERY LONELY.

280
00:17:05,789 --> 00:17:07,758
MA'AM, I HAVE A PACKAGE FOR YOU.

281
00:17:07,791 --> 00:17:10,661
I BET YOU DO, BIG BOY.

282
00:17:10,694 --> 00:17:13,764
YEAH SO JUST TAKE IT AND SIGN, OKAY?

283
00:17:13,797 --> 00:17:17,901
WHAT'S YOUR HURRY, YOU BIG HANDSOME HUNK OF MAN?

284
00:17:17,935 --> 00:17:21,939
WHY DON'T YOU BRING THAT PACKAGE IN FOR A LITTLE DRINK?

285
00:17:21,972 --> 00:17:25,909
NO, NO I CAN'T. BECAUSE I HATE YOU.

286
00:17:27,511 --> 00:17:32,816
SHH. I WON'T SIGN UNLESS YOU COME IN - AND HAVE SOMETHING.

287
00:17:38,522 --> 00:17:41,225
GAVIN. WE NEED TO SEE YOUR FACE SO WE CAN HEAR YOU.

288
00:17:41,258 --> 00:17:43,794
MS. KWAN, I CAN'T.

289
00:17:53,837 --> 00:17:59,042
OKAY. NOW THAT'S WHY NO ONE SHOULD EVER WEAR TRACK PANTS.

290
00:18:05,215 --> 00:18:10,154
HEY SPIN. AND HOW'S LITTLE SPINNER DOING TODAY?

291
00:18:10,187 --> 00:18:12,156
ARE YOU STILL IN THE RED?

292
00:18:12,189 --> 00:18:13,891
LITTLE SPINNER IS HIDING.

293
00:18:13,924 --> 00:18:18,529
AND YOU SHOULD BE TOO. BECAUSE I'M GONNA KILL YOU.

294
00:18:18,562 --> 00:18:20,197
COME ON. IT WAS FUNNY.

295
00:18:20,831 --> 00:18:23,767
FOR YOU. FOR ME IT WAS JUST BRUTAL.

296
00:18:25,269 --> 00:18:29,106
YOU CAN'T SPEND THE REST OF YOUR HORMONAL LIFE LIKE THIS.

297
00:18:29,139 --> 00:18:32,676
IT'S NOT MY FAULT. IT'S THE HEALTH FOOD.

298
00:18:32,709 --> 00:18:36,880
FOR THE LAST TIME, FOOD HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH IT.

299
00:18:38,148 --> 00:18:41,585
SHEILA? CAN YOU COME HERE FOR A SECOND?

300
00:18:41,618 --> 00:18:44,288
WHAT CAN I DO YOU FOR, LADIES?

301
00:18:44,321 --> 00:18:49,259
QUESTION. DOES FOOD- HEATH FOOD HELP GET MEN IN THE MOOD?

302
00:18:50,861 --> 00:18:52,830
WELL THEY SAY CLAMS DO.

303
00:18:52,863 --> 00:18:57,568
BUT I COOKED 'EM FOR THE HUBBY AND ALL HE GOT WAS GAS.

304
00:18:59,736 --> 00:19:05,209
OKAY SAY YOU KNEW A TEENAGER AND HE WAS ALWAYS IN THE RED.

305
00:19:05,242 --> 00:19:07,177
WOULD FOOD HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH IT?

306
00:19:07,211 --> 00:19:07,811
FOOD?

307
00:19:13,016 --> 00:19:14,651
YOU GOTTA BE KIDDING.

308
00:19:14,685 --> 00:19:17,921
AT YOUR AGE IT'S ALL ABOUT HORMONES.

309
00:19:17,955 --> 00:19:18,288
SEE?

310
00:19:19,790 --> 00:19:22,559
DON'T WORRY, JIMMY, IT'S JUST A STAGE.

311
00:19:22,593 --> 00:19:25,095
A HORMONAL HICCUP.

312
00:19:26,864 --> 00:19:27,798
IT'LL PASS.

313
00:19:33,337 --> 00:19:36,273
I CAN'T BELIEVE SHE THINKS IT'S ME.

314
00:19:37,274 --> 00:19:42,212
WELL I MEAN. WHY NOT? IT'S ALL ABOUT THE HORMONES, RIGHT?

315
00:19:42,813 --> 00:19:44,748
COULD HAPPEN TO ANYONE.

316
00:19:50,354 --> 00:19:52,089
I NEVER WIN ANYTHING!

317
00:19:52,122 --> 00:19:53,156
LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE ON A STREAK.

318
00:19:53,190 --> 00:19:55,926
FIRST ME AND NOW THE CENTREPIECE.

319
00:19:58,695 --> 00:19:59,963
HEY EMMA.

320
00:20:01,732 --> 00:20:04,268
I SHOULD PROBABLY GET GOING.

321
00:20:04,301 --> 00:20:06,970
MR. SIMPSON - CAN I TALK TO YOU FIRST?

322
00:20:18,649 --> 00:20:21,051
I WAS A BIT OF A FREAK TODAY.

323
00:20:22,286 --> 00:20:23,887
YOU WERE CONCERNED.

324
00:20:24,421 --> 00:20:27,824
YOUR MOM AND I PUT YOU IN AN UNCOMFORTABLE SITUATION.

325
00:20:27,858 --> 00:20:29,293
NO KIDDING.

326
00:20:29,326 --> 00:20:35,165
IT WOULD'VE BEEN NICE IF YOU HADN'T OF DONE IT IN FRONT OF MY CLASS.

327
00:20:35,198 --> 00:20:37,734
YOU KNOW I CARE ABOUT YOUR MOTHER.

328
00:20:37,768 --> 00:20:39,770
NO. IT'S NOT ABOUT THAT.

329
00:20:40,871 --> 00:20:42,839
IT'S ABOUT ME, IN SCHOOL.

330
00:20:42,873 --> 00:20:44,741
AND EVERYONE THINKING I'M YOUR LITTLE PET.

331
00:20:44,775 --> 00:20:48,245
I PROMISE, I'LL TREAT YOU EXACTLY THE WAY I TREAT EVERYONE ELSE.

332
00:20:48,278 --> 00:20:51,381
THAT WON'T MATTER. PEOPLE THEY THINK WHAT THEY WANT TO THINK.

333
00:20:51,415 --> 00:20:54,117
WELL, I DON'T KNOW, MAYBE -

334
00:20:54,151 --> 00:20:56,787
WE SHOULD JUST TRANSFER YOU OUT OF MY CLASS?

335
00:20:56,820 --> 00:20:57,087
NO.

336
00:20:59,389 --> 00:21:02,659
OR YOUR MOM AND I SHOULD STOP DATING.

337
00:21:04,328 --> 00:21:06,797
I DON'T WANT THAT EITHER...

338
00:21:10,367 --> 00:21:13,337
YOU KNOW I WAS PROUD OF YOU TODAY.

339
00:21:13,370 --> 00:21:15,272
THE WAY YOU SAVED YOUR PROJECT AT THE VERY LAST SECOND?

340
00:21:15,305 --> 00:21:17,174
WAS VERY, VERY COOL.

341
00:21:18,275 --> 00:21:21,812
AND VERY DESERVING OF FIRST PLACE. OKAY?

342
00:21:22,346 --> 00:21:24,381
OKAY. THANKS... SNAKE.

343
00:21:28,852 --> 00:21:30,253
NO PROBLEM, EMMERS.

344
00:21:31,054 --> 00:21:31,888
ARCHIBALD.

345
00:21:32,956 --> 00:21:33,690
EMMALADA.

346
00:21:34,291 --> 00:21:35,359
THE SNAKESTER.
