187
00:09:41,346 --> 00:09:43,481
WAS ABOUT A HUNDRED DOLLARS MORE.

188
00:09:43,514 --> 00:09:46,284
THAT'S NO PROBLEM. I'M AN OUTSTANDING HAGGLER.

189
00:09:46,317 --> 00:09:48,319
(Telephone Ringing)

190
00:09:48,353 --> 00:09:51,189
UH, HOW'S TOMORROW SOUND? DINNER OUT?

191
00:09:51,222 --> 00:09:51,522
HELLO?

192
00:09:53,024 --> 00:09:53,424
JOEY.

193
00:09:55,026 --> 00:09:56,961
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

194
00:10:02,734 --> 00:10:05,670
NO, GO AHEAD. I'M STILL HERE...

195
00:10:21,219 --> 00:10:22,620
SEAN? HEY. HEY MAN,

196
00:10:23,321 --> 00:10:26,124
UM, I WAS WONDERING IF YOU AH -

197
00:10:27,091 --> 00:10:30,028
IF YOU WERE DOING ANYTHING TONIGHT?

198
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:37,268
CRAIG?

199
00:10:37,302 --> 00:10:38,436
OH, WHAT'S THAT?

200
00:10:39,470 --> 00:10:41,072
OPEN THIS DOOR NOW.

201
00:10:41,739 --> 00:10:42,974
YEAH? YEAH.

202
00:10:43,007 --> 00:10:43,508
THIS IS MY HOUSE! WHEN I SAY OPEN THE DOOR,

203
00:10:43,541 --> 00:10:45,343
YOU OPEN THE DOOR!

204
00:10:45,376 --> 00:10:46,077
CRAIG!

205
00:10:49,414 --> 00:10:51,482
OKAY. I'LL BE RIGHT OVER.

206
00:11:05,830 --> 00:11:08,466
OKAY. WANNA HEAR A JOKE?

207
00:11:08,499 --> 00:11:10,401
YOU GOTTA PROMISE NOT TO GET UPSET OR SOMETHING -

208
00:11:10,435 --> 00:11:12,737
AS IF I'D GET UPSET AT A JOKE.

209
00:11:14,339 --> 00:11:17,608
WHAT IS A CHEERLEADER'S FAVORITE DRINK?

210
00:11:19,477 --> 00:11:21,179
ROOT BEER. GET IT?

211
00:11:21,212 --> 00:11:22,347
ROOT BEER? ROOT...

212
00:11:24,349 --> 00:11:26,050
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU WOULD MAKE A CHEERLEADING JOKE

213
00:11:26,084 --> 00:11:29,053
TO LAST YEAR'S HEAD CHEERLEADER.

214
00:11:29,087 --> 00:11:32,557
I'LL FORGIVE YOU - IF YOU ANSWER ME THIS.

215
00:11:32,590 --> 00:11:35,693
WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A NORTH PARK CHEERLEADER

216
00:11:35,727 --> 00:11:37,762
AND A BAG OF TRASH?

217
00:11:37,795 --> 00:11:39,397
I DON'T KNOW. WHAT?

218
00:11:39,430 --> 00:11:42,300
TRASH GETS TAKEN OUT MORE OFTEN.

219
00:11:43,134 --> 00:11:43,768
(Laughter)

220
00:11:45,336 --> 00:11:46,771
BETTER GET A NAPKIN.

221
00:11:46,804 --> 00:11:48,306
I BETTER GET A NAPKIN.

222
00:11:48,339 --> 00:11:50,074
AHEM...

223
00:11:54,112 --> 00:11:57,115
HAZEL? WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

224
00:11:57,148 --> 00:11:58,483
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

225
00:11:58,516 --> 00:12:01,119
LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE HAVING FUN.

226
00:12:02,887 --> 00:12:05,490
YOU'VE MORE THAN EARNED THIS.

227
00:12:06,124 --> 00:12:08,126
WET DREAM TIME... IS OVER.

228
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:09,494
LET'S GO.

229
00:12:13,564 --> 00:12:16,434
YOU GOT PAID TO GO OUT WITH ME?

230
00:12:16,467 --> 00:12:17,068
SUE ME.

231
00:12:23,274 --> 00:12:25,676
SURGEON, HUH? IS HE RICH?

232
00:12:26,711 --> 00:12:28,479
YEAH, CRAZY RICH.

233
00:12:28,513 --> 00:12:32,216
BUT HIS - HIS JOB'S STRESSFUL.

234
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:34,318
SO UM... SO WE FIGHT.

235
00:12:37,555 --> 00:12:40,258
AND I'VE BEEN THINKING -

236
00:12:41,893 --> 00:12:43,261
I MAY GO SOLO.

237
00:12:44,362 --> 00:12:46,164
I'VE GOT THE MONEY.

238
00:12:47,732 --> 00:12:49,333
I'M THINKIN' B.C.

239
00:12:52,370 --> 00:12:53,571
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

240
00:12:53,604 --> 00:12:57,208
YEAH, DEADLY SERIOUS. I'M OUTTA HERE. TONIGHT.

241
00:12:57,241 --> 00:12:58,743
YOU'RE GONNA WIND UP ON THE STREETS.

242
00:12:58,776 --> 00:12:59,544
THEY SUCK.

243
00:12:59,577 --> 00:13:01,446
THEN - COME WITH ME!

244
00:13:02,447 --> 00:13:05,216
WE'LL WATCH OUT FOR EACH OTHER!

245
00:13:05,249 --> 00:13:07,885
CRAIG, C'MON. LOOK, I CAN'T LEAVE.

246
00:13:12,523 --> 00:13:16,561
LOOK AH, BEFORE YOU ASKED ME IF MY PARENTS HIT ME, RIGHT?

247
00:13:16,594 --> 00:13:17,428
DID I? SO?

248
00:13:19,197 --> 00:13:22,600
I DON'T KNOW. DOES - DOES YOUR DAD HIT YOU?

249
00:13:38,783 --> 00:13:42,587
COME ON, CRAIG, GET OFF THE TRACKS.

250
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:44,422
YOU STOP KIDDIN' AROUND, MAN. GET OFF THE TRACKS.

251
00:13:44,455 --> 00:13:45,389
GET OFF ME.

252
00:13:47,792 --> 00:13:52,463
CRAIG! CRAIG, GET OFF THE DAMN TRACKS, MAN.

253
00:13:53,998 --> 00:13:55,867
QUIT PLAYIN' AROUND. GET OFF THE TRACKS!

254
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:56,901
CRAIG!

255
00:13:58,035 --> 00:14:00,204
CRAIG, QUIT PLAYIN' AROUND MAN, GET OFF THE TRACKS!

256
00:14:00,238 --> 00:14:01,305
CRAIG -

257
00:14:13,384 --> 00:14:14,218
(Laughter)

258
00:14:18,923 --> 00:14:19,524
WHOO!

259
00:14:23,427 --> 00:14:25,563
MAN, WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?!

260
00:14:28,699 --> 00:14:31,536
OKAY, NOW THIS IS AN EASY ONE. TWO PLUS TWO IS?

261
00:14:31,569 --> 00:14:31,836
FOUR.

262
00:14:31,869 --> 00:14:32,436
YEAH.

263
00:14:33,838 --> 00:14:35,406
JOEY? JOEY?

264
00:14:35,439 --> 00:14:36,574
WE NEED TO TALK TO YOU. IT'S ABOUT CRAIG.

265
00:14:36,607 --> 00:14:38,009
YOU SAID HE'S GOING TO B.C.

266
00:14:38,042 --> 00:14:39,911
BUT YOU KNOW HE'S JUST GOING TO END UP ON THE STREETS.

267
00:14:39,944 --> 00:14:42,413
IF HE DOESN'T KILL HIMSELF FIRST.

268
00:14:42,446 --> 00:14:42,647
WHAT?

269
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:48,519
LAST TIME I SAW CRAIG HE WAS PLAYING CHICKEN WITH A TRAIN.

270
00:14:48,553 --> 00:14:49,320
FOR REAL.

271
00:14:49,353 --> 00:14:50,588
GUYS, WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO?

272
00:14:50,621 --> 00:14:52,423
I CAN CALL HIS FATHER AGAIN -

273
00:14:52,456 --> 00:14:55,459
JOEY, HIS DAD IS THE PROBLEM.

274
00:14:55,493 --> 00:14:56,561
HE BEATS HIM.

275
00:14:58,062 --> 00:14:59,063
NOW WAIT A MINUTE,

276
00:14:59,096 --> 00:15:00,198
DO YOU KNOW WHAT A SERIOUS ACCUSATION THAT IS?

277
00:15:00,231 --> 00:15:02,500
I CAN'T GO ACCUSING THE GUY OF THAT, ALL RIGHT?

278
00:15:02,533 --> 00:15:04,936
IS SOMETHING WRONG WITH CRAIG?

279
00:15:04,969 --> 00:15:07,505
NOT NOW, HONEY, OKAY? THIS IS SERIOUS.

280
00:15:07,538 --> 00:15:08,839
NO.

281
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:11,008
I SAW, TODAY -

282
00:15:11,976 --> 00:15:13,844
I KNOW - I KNOW YOU SAW HIM TODAY OKAY?

283
00:15:13,878 --> 00:15:15,713
NO, I SAW. ALL PURPLE.

284
00:15:16,847 --> 00:15:19,584
A DINOSAUR HURTS HIM. HE TOLD ME.

285
00:15:27,058 --> 00:15:29,427
OKAY, SEAN. WHY DON'T YOU AND I START AT THE RAILROAD TRACKS.

286
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:31,362
EMMA, COULD YOU PLEASE JUST WATCH HER?

287
00:15:31,395 --> 00:15:33,331
OF COURSE.

288
00:16:01,559 --> 00:16:03,494
(Telephone Ringing)

289
00:16:03,527 --> 00:16:03,828
HELLO?

290
00:16:04,629 --> 00:16:05,396
HEY, ANY SIGN OF HIM?

291
00:16:05,429 --> 00:16:06,297
NOTHING.

292
00:16:07,398 --> 00:16:08,666
OKAY. WE'RE GOING TO DO ONE MORE SWEEP OF THE AREA.

293
00:16:08,699 --> 00:16:09,567
IF WE DON'T FIND HIM,

294
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:12,536
WE'RE GOING TO GO TO THE POLICE, OKAY?

295
00:16:12,570 --> 00:16:14,472
WE MAY BE LATE.

296
00:16:14,505 --> 00:16:15,840
HOLD ON A SEC...

297
00:16:20,778 --> 00:16:24,715
I THINK THERE'S ONE MORE PLACE YOU SHOULD LOOK.

298
00:16:38,829 --> 00:16:39,530
CRAIG?

299
00:16:41,899 --> 00:16:42,400
CRAIG?

300
00:16:45,536 --> 00:16:46,871
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

301
00:16:46,904 --> 00:16:49,040
HEY, WHOA, WHOA, JUST -

302
00:16:49,073 --> 00:16:50,408
I JUST WANT TO HELP, OKAY?

303
00:16:50,441 --> 00:16:51,375
I'M FINE!

304
00:16:52,076 --> 00:16:53,678
YEAH RIGHT, LOOK AT YOU.

305
00:16:54,445 --> 00:16:57,848
WHAT'S THIS I HEAR ABOUT A TRAIN, HUH?

306
00:16:57,882 --> 00:16:59,483
SEAN TOLD YOU THAT?

307
00:17:00,885 --> 00:17:02,820
WELL HE'S A LIAR.

308
00:17:03,688 --> 00:17:04,522
LIAR!

309
00:17:04,555 --> 00:17:06,557
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA. COME ON.

310
00:17:06,590 --> 00:17:08,025
GET OUTTA HERE!

311
00:17:08,059 --> 00:17:10,027
LET'S GO, OKAY? LET'S GO.

312
00:17:10,061 --> 00:17:10,961
JUST CALM DOWN

313
00:17:10,995 --> 00:17:12,963
AND GET OUT OF HERE OKAY?

314
00:17:12,997 --> 00:17:15,966
WHERE AM I GONNA GO, HUH? WHERE AM I GONNA GO BACK...?

315
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,669
WHAT? BACK HOME SO SO DAD CAN-

316
00:17:20,438 --> 00:17:21,572
WHAT? DO WHAT?

317
00:17:21,605 --> 00:17:23,341
WHAT DOES HE DO TO YOU?

318
00:17:27,211 --> 00:17:29,347
HE HITS YOU DOESN'T HE?

319
00:17:33,217 --> 00:17:34,151
DOESN'T HE?

320
00:17:46,564 --> 00:17:46,964
YEAH.

321
00:17:49,967 --> 00:17:50,634
HE DOES.

322
00:18:16,694 --> 00:18:17,828
JT, PLEASE STOP.

323
00:18:21,732 --> 00:18:25,836
I'M HAVING SOME RESIDUAL GUILT ABOUT FRIDAY NIGHT.

324
00:18:25,870 --> 00:18:28,672
THAT SAID, I REALLY NEEDED THE MONEY.

325
00:18:28,706 --> 00:18:29,540
WOW. YOU KNOW WHAT?

326
00:18:29,573 --> 00:18:31,876
THAT MAKES ME FEEL A WHOLE LOT BETTER.

327
00:18:31,909 --> 00:18:33,544
JT, YOU'RE A GOOD DATE.

328
00:18:33,577 --> 00:18:37,715
IF YOU WEREN'T 5-1, AND IN A SUBTERRANEAN SOCIAL STRATA?

329
00:18:37,748 --> 00:18:41,051
I'D MAYBE EVEN CONSIDER GOING OUT AGAIN.

330
00:18:41,085 --> 00:18:41,685
REALLY?

331
00:18:42,319 --> 00:18:44,655
YES. BUT - NO. SORRY, HON.

332
00:18:44,955 --> 00:18:47,691
I ONLY DATE UP. NOTHING PERSONAL.

333
00:18:47,725 --> 00:18:48,926
SURE. OF COURSE.

334
00:18:48,959 --> 00:18:52,663
BUT AH, YOU KNOW, I WOULD FEEL BETTER IF -

335
00:18:54,565 --> 00:18:56,100
IF WHAT? SPIT IT OUT.

336
00:18:58,602 --> 00:19:02,740
CALL ME ROMANTIC, BUT I ALWAYS IMAGINED MY FIRST DATE

337
00:19:02,773 --> 00:19:04,175
ENDING IN A KISS.

338
00:19:04,942 --> 00:19:05,743
NO WAY.

339
00:19:07,111 --> 00:19:08,579
COME ON, PAIGE.

340
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:12,583
YOU'D BE MAKING MY DREAMS COME TRUE.

341
00:19:17,788 --> 00:19:18,956
WE'RE SO EVEN.

342
00:19:20,624 --> 00:19:22,927
OH HERE. YOU FORGOT YOUR BEAR.

343
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:36,707
I WANNA DO THIS ALONE.

344
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:38,075
OKAY.

345
00:19:38,108 --> 00:19:40,244
BUT DO IT JUST LIKE WE TALKED ABOUT.

346
00:19:40,277 --> 00:19:42,112
GO IN. SAY AS LITTLE AS YOU CAN.

347
00:19:42,146 --> 00:19:45,816
GO UPSTAIRS, GET YOUR THINGS AND COME OUT.

348
00:19:45,850 --> 00:19:50,921
HE KNOWS YOU'RE COMING AND HE KNOWS WHAT HAS TO HAPPEN.

349
00:20:18,315 --> 00:20:20,084
I'M JUST GOING TO GET MY STUFF.

350
00:20:20,117 --> 00:20:20,918
CRAIG, JUST LEAVE IT, LEAVE IT.

351
00:20:20,951 --> 00:20:22,086
COME BACK WHEN YOU'VE COOLED DOWN.

352
00:20:22,119 --> 00:20:23,153
WE'LL TALK THIS THING THROUGH.

353
00:20:23,187 --> 00:20:25,022
NO MORE TALKING, OKAY?

354
00:20:26,290 --> 00:20:28,325
OKAY. BUT YOU'RE BREAKING MY HEART, YOU KNOW THAT.

355
00:20:28,359 --> 00:20:30,194
JUST LIKE YOUR MOTHER.

356
00:20:30,227 --> 00:20:31,896
PLEASE, CRAIG.

357
00:20:31,929 --> 00:20:33,297
I KNOW I'VE BEEN IMPATIENT.

358
00:20:33,330 --> 00:20:36,700
BUT, WORK HAS BEEN REALLY STRESSFUL.

359
00:20:36,734 --> 00:20:39,670
YOU CAN'T LEAVE, CRAIG. I LOVE YOU.

360
00:20:48,646 --> 00:20:50,781
THERE'RE THREE OPTIONS, DAD.

361
00:20:51,415 --> 00:20:54,685
I CAN GO TO CHILDREN'S AID RIGHT NOW.

362
00:20:55,219 --> 00:21:00,691
I CAN GO AND STAY WITH JOEY WHILE WE SORT THIS STUFF OUT.

363
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:04,762
OR I CAN COME BACK HERE.

364
00:21:05,396 --> 00:21:07,064
AND LET YOU BEAT ME.

365
00:21:07,431 --> 00:21:09,133
I DON'T BEAT YOU.
