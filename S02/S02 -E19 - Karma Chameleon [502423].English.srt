1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,670
IT'S ALL ABOUT THE TIGHT SATIN SHORTS IF YOU ASK ME.

2
00:00:04,703 --> 00:00:07,539
OOH! TIGHT SATIN SHORTS? WE'RE THERE!

3
00:00:07,572 --> 00:00:11,810
THEN PENCIL IT IN, BOYS. RETRO ROLLER-SKATING PARTY!

4
00:00:11,843 --> 00:00:15,547
ROLLER-SKATING PARTY? THAT SOUNDS COOL.

5
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:16,982
FUNNY HOW SOMETHING IS COOL ONE YEAR

6
00:00:17,015 --> 00:00:21,019
AND SO TOTALLY UNCOOL THE NEXT. KIND OF LIKE PEOPLE.

7
00:00:21,053 --> 00:00:23,989
I GET IT, PAIGE. YOU DON'T HAVE TO INVITE ME TO YOUR DUMB PARTY.

8
00:00:24,022 --> 00:00:25,957
AW. BUT I WAS KIND OF HOPING YOU COULD TAKE DRUGS

9
00:00:25,991 --> 00:00:29,728
AND ACT LIKE A TOTAL FREAK AND DESTROY EVERYTHING.

10
00:00:29,761 --> 00:00:32,497
OH WAIT - YOU DID THAT LAST YEAR.

11
00:00:37,969 --> 00:00:41,707
I DON'T GET IT - IT WAS JUST ONE MISTAKE.

12
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:43,642
ALRIGHT, ONE BIG MISTAKE.

13
00:00:43,675 --> 00:00:44,843
IT'LL ALL BLOW OVER.

14
00:00:44,876 --> 00:00:46,978
OR, IT WON'T. I WANT MY FRIENDS BACK, TER.

15
00:00:47,012 --> 00:00:49,481
AND JUST STANDING BY IS NOT GONNA MAKE THAT HAPPEN.

16
00:00:50,482 --> 00:00:52,484
♪ WHAT EVER IT TAKES

17
00:00:53,985 --> 00:00:57,022
♪ I KNOW I CAN MAKE IT THROUGH

18
00:00:59,191 --> 00:01:00,992
♪ IF I HOLD OUT

19
00:01:02,928 --> 00:01:05,964
♪ I KNOW I CAN MAKE IT THROUGH

20
00:01:11,036 --> 00:01:12,838
♪ BE THE BEST

21
00:01:12,871 --> 00:01:15,006
♪ THE BEST THAT I CAN BE

22
00:01:15,941 --> 00:01:18,477
♪ HEAR WHAT I SAY TO YOU

23
00:01:19,711 --> 00:01:21,713
♪ WHAT EVER IT TAKES

24
00:01:23,048 --> 00:01:25,417
♪ I KNOW I CAN MAKE IT

25
00:01:27,953 --> 00:01:30,889
♪ I KNOW I CAN MAKE IT THROUGH

26
00:01:35,694 --> 00:01:38,563
SO WHICH DO YOU LIKE BETTER - LEFT PROFILE? OR RIGHT?

27
00:01:38,597 --> 00:01:40,966
IT'S NOT A FASHION SHOOT...

28
00:01:40,999 --> 00:01:46,605
UH, IT'S OUR PHOTO DAY, AND I WANT IT TO BE JUST - PERFECT!

29
00:01:49,908 --> 00:01:50,976
ELLIE, RIGHT?

30
00:01:51,009 --> 00:01:51,877
UH-HUH...

31
00:01:52,644 --> 00:01:53,912
HERE'S THE DEAL.

32
00:01:53,945 --> 00:01:55,947
HAZEL AND I - BEST FRIENDS.

33
00:01:55,981 --> 00:01:58,517
BUT HAZEL'S STUCK ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ROOM.

34
00:01:58,550 --> 00:01:59,951
YOU, HOWEVER, ARE RIGHT HERE.

35
00:01:59,985 --> 00:02:02,921
AND YOU WANT ME TO SWITCH.

36
00:02:02,954 --> 00:02:04,956
I KNEW YOU'D UNDERSTAND.

37
00:02:10,796 --> 00:02:13,632
HON. MAYBE YOU DIDN'T HEAR ME -

38
00:02:13,665 --> 00:02:16,668
I DID. LOUD AND CLEAR. THANKS.

39
00:02:26,244 --> 00:02:28,246
HEY, PAIGE-

40
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:31,216
OKAY THIS IS SO NOT THE TIME TO TALK TO ME.

41
00:02:31,249 --> 00:02:33,552
JUST FOR A SEC? PLEASE.

42
00:02:33,585 --> 00:02:33,985
WHAT?

43
00:02:36,321 --> 00:02:38,957
YOU AND I HAVE BEEN FRIENDS SINCE GRADE TWO.

44
00:02:38,990 --> 00:02:41,760
THAT'S ALMOST TEN YEARS. HALF OF OUR LIVES --

45
00:02:41,793 --> 00:02:44,029
IS THIS AN APOLOGY OR A MATH LESSON?

46
00:02:44,062 --> 00:02:47,065
AN APOLOGY. WHAT I CALLED YOU -

47
00:02:47,098 --> 00:02:49,234
I BELIEVE THE WORD WAS "HAG"?

48
00:02:49,267 --> 00:02:50,535
IT WAS WRONG.

49
00:02:51,303 --> 00:02:54,840
I WAS THE REAL HAG. AND I'M SORRY.

50
00:02:55,974 --> 00:02:57,876
MORNING FOLKS. PHOTO DAY'S COMING.

51
00:02:57,909 --> 00:03:01,513
AND I'VE GOT THE FORMS TO PROVE IT.

52
00:03:06,017 --> 00:03:09,221
I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW MANY SITES THERE ARE DEVOTED TO ANIME.

53
00:03:09,254 --> 00:03:10,488
NOT THIS AGAIN.

54
00:03:10,522 --> 00:03:13,992
JT, ANIME IS THE BIGGEST DEVELOPMENT IN ANIMATION IN YEARS.

55
00:03:14,025 --> 00:03:16,995
AN-I-REALLY-DON'T-CARE. AN-I-THINK-IT'S-FOR-GEEKS.

56
00:03:17,028 --> 00:03:18,997
ANIME IS ACTUALLY VERY CURRENT.

57
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:20,866
SEE! SHE KNOWS ABOUT ANIME!

58
00:03:20,899 --> 00:03:22,801
WHO'S YOUR FAVOURITE CHARACTER? ASHUHARA?

59
00:03:22,834 --> 00:03:25,203
I SAID I KNOW ABOUT IT. I DIDN'T SAY I LIKE IT.

60
00:03:25,237 --> 00:03:26,204
YOU SEE?

61
00:03:26,238 --> 00:03:28,807
TOBY, GIRLS AREN'T INTO THAT STUFF.

62
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:29,774
HEY, CRAIG!

63
00:03:32,777 --> 00:03:35,914
YOU SEE TOBY, THAT'S WHAT GIRLS ARE INTO.

64
00:03:35,947 --> 00:03:37,682
AND IT'S SURE NOT ME.

65
00:03:38,116 --> 00:03:41,052
I MAY BE THE FIRST JEWISH MONK.

66
00:03:42,888 --> 00:03:45,357
ALRIGHT SO WHAT MOLECULE DO YOU GET

67
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:48,326
WHEN YOU HAVE TWO ATOMS OF HYDROGEN

68
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:50,595
AND TWO ATOMS OF OXYGEN?

69
00:03:53,064 --> 00:03:54,132
GAVIN? GAVIN?

70
00:03:59,738 --> 00:04:02,741
SORRY, MS. HATZILAKOS. I DON'T KNOW.

71
00:04:04,409 --> 00:04:05,911
HYDROGEN PEROXIDE.

72
00:04:06,711 --> 00:04:10,248
OR VERY BLONDE HAIR, IF YOU'RE NOT CAREFUL...

73
00:04:11,016 --> 00:04:12,150
ALRIGHT REMEMBER - THE FIRST 20 ELEMENTS

74
00:04:12,183 --> 00:04:15,253
ON THE PERIODIC TABLE FOR NEXT CLASS.

75
00:04:23,028 --> 00:04:23,528
JIMMY.

76
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:27,032
STOP AND LISTEN. PLEASE?

77
00:04:28,867 --> 00:04:32,103
I'M REALLY SORRY FOR HUMILIATING YOU.

78
00:04:32,137 --> 00:04:35,974
FOR BEING CRUEL. FOR WHAT HAPPENED, WITH SEAN.

79
00:04:36,007 --> 00:04:38,810
IT WAS THE DRUGS. IT WASN'T ME.

80
00:04:40,078 --> 00:04:42,881
YOU MAKE IT SOUND LIKE NO BIG THING.

81
00:04:42,914 --> 00:04:46,184
IT WAS. AND I'VE BEEN PAYING FOR IT, JIMMY.

82
00:04:46,217 --> 00:04:49,054
I SPENT THE SUMMER IN COUNSELLING.

83
00:04:54,225 --> 00:04:55,694
YOU OKAY?

84
00:04:57,028 --> 00:04:59,331
YEAH. I JUST MISSED YOU, ASH.

85
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,436
I MISSED YOU A LOT.

86
00:05:04,469 --> 00:05:06,071
I MISSED YOU TOO.

87
00:05:06,972 --> 00:05:09,007
IT HASN'T FELT THE SAME.

88
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,942
EVEN MY MOM MISSES YOU.

89
00:05:10,976 --> 00:05:11,977
REALLY?

90
00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:13,178
TOBY, TOO -

91
00:05:13,211 --> 00:05:17,949
HIS BASKETBALL GAME'S TOTALLY HURTING WITHOUT YOUR HELP.

92
00:05:17,983 --> 00:05:21,052
WELL MAYBE I COULD COME OVER SOME TIME?

93
00:05:21,086 --> 00:05:22,921
I MEAN, IF TOBY'D WANT ME TO...

94
00:05:22,954 --> 00:05:25,290
KNOW WHAT? I THINK HE WOULD.

95
00:05:27,993 --> 00:05:28,393
OKAY.

96
00:05:35,734 --> 00:05:40,205
HEY MR. SIMPSON -- IS THAT DRAWING ANIME CD-ROM IN YET?

97
00:05:40,238 --> 00:05:42,707
AH SORRY, TOBES. I FORGOT YOU WANTED IT

98
00:05:42,741 --> 00:05:44,943
AND LET IT OUT TO SOMEONE ELSE.

99
00:05:44,976 --> 00:05:46,444
OH ALRIGHT. WHO'S GOT IT?

100
00:05:46,478 --> 00:05:46,945
ME.

101
00:05:50,048 --> 00:05:53,885
TOBY ISAACS, MEET KENDRA MASON. MY TWO BIGGEST ANIME FANATICS.

102
00:05:53,918 --> 00:05:56,287
MEET ME AT LUNCH TOMORROW. I'LL HAND THIS OFF.

103
00:05:56,321 --> 00:05:58,056
WHAT DO YOU SAY?

104
00:05:58,089 --> 00:06:00,692
GREAT, SEE YOU AT LUNCH THEN.

105
00:06:03,361 --> 00:06:04,295
UH... OKAY.

106
00:06:10,969 --> 00:06:13,071
GUYS, THIS IS CLASSIC ASHLEY.

107
00:06:13,104 --> 00:06:15,407
SHE'S SWEET-TALKING HER WAY THROUGH ALL OF US.

108
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,941
PAIGE, C'MON -

109
00:06:16,975 --> 00:06:18,843
C'MON WHAT?

110
00:06:18,877 --> 00:06:21,312
IF I CAN FORGIVE ASH, THEN SO CAN YOU.

111
00:06:21,346 --> 00:06:23,982
YOU STILL LIKE HER, DON'T YOU?

112
00:06:24,015 --> 00:06:26,951
WE HAD A GOOD TALK, LIKE OLD TIMES.

113
00:06:27,519 --> 00:06:29,754
YEAH. TOTALLY OLD TIMES.

114
00:06:29,788 --> 00:06:32,190
ASH'S BEEN "MISSING JIMMY" TOO.

115
00:06:33,058 --> 00:06:35,160
OKAY, AM I, LIKE, THE ONLY SANE ONE HERE?

116
00:06:35,193 --> 00:06:37,796
OR THE ONLY THREATENED ONE...

117
00:06:39,898 --> 00:06:40,999
WHAT DID YOU JUST SAY?

118
00:06:41,032 --> 00:06:43,134
I SAID, MAYBE YOU SHOULD LET IT GO.

119
00:06:43,168 --> 00:06:46,104
ASH MADE A MISTAKE, SHE APOLOGIZED.

120
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:51,042
YOU GUYS MIGHT BE RIGHT.

121
00:06:51,843 --> 00:06:54,979
BUT IF YOU'RE NOT? ASH BETTER WATCH OUT.

122
00:07:00,318 --> 00:07:03,188
LISTEN QUEEN-BEE, THIS ISN'T A SOUP KITCHEN I'M RUNNING HERE.

123
00:07:03,221 --> 00:07:06,157
I KNOW. I'LL BRING THE EXTRA DOLLAR TOMORROW, I PROMISE.

124
00:07:06,191 --> 00:07:07,459
HEY I GOT THAT.

125
00:07:13,264 --> 00:07:17,068
SAVED BY THE KNIGHT IN SHINING DENIM. NEXT!

126
00:07:19,137 --> 00:07:21,206
THANKS FOR THAT.

127
00:07:22,006 --> 00:07:23,942
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

128
00:07:25,577 --> 00:07:28,446
SO, HOW LONG ARE WE GOING TO PRETEND LIKE NOTHING HAPPENED?

129
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:30,415
HAVEN'T WE PAID FOR IT BY NOW?

130
00:07:30,448 --> 00:07:31,816
IF YOU SAY SO.

131
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:33,918
I DO. FRIENDS, OKAY?

132
00:07:35,587 --> 00:07:35,987
YEAH.

133
00:07:42,927 --> 00:07:47,232
ARE YOU EVER GONNA TELL ME WHAT HAPPENED WITH YOU TWO?

134
00:07:47,265 --> 00:07:49,934
A PARTY LAST YEAR, WE HOOKED UP.

135
00:07:50,969 --> 00:07:54,139
AND SHE'S IGNORED YOU EVER SINCE.

136
00:07:54,172 --> 00:07:57,008
WELL SHE'S NOT IGNORING YOU NOW...

137
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:05,083
OKAY, TWELFTH NIGHT, ACT FIVE.

138
00:08:05,116 --> 00:08:10,288
EVERYTHING ALL WRAPPED UP IN A SHAKESPEAREAN HOLLYWOOD ENDING.

139
00:08:25,503 --> 00:08:27,906
THE ONE THING I DISLIKE MORE THAN LATENESS,

140
00:08:27,939 --> 00:08:31,509
ASHLEY KERWIN, IS PEOPLE TRYING TO GET AWAY WITH IT.

141
00:08:31,543 --> 00:08:33,278
SEE ME AFTER CLASS.

142
00:08:33,311 --> 00:08:34,846
SORRY, MS. KWAN.

143
00:08:37,615 --> 00:08:40,084
LET'S HANG A BELL AROUND KWAN'S NECK.

144
00:08:40,118 --> 00:08:41,986
'CAUSE SHE'S A TOTAL COW.

145
00:08:52,363 --> 00:08:54,432
OKAY, WHAT ABOUT THIS?

146
00:08:54,465 --> 00:08:56,100
WHAT ABOUT THIS MASSIVE ZIT ON MY FACE -

147
00:08:56,134 --> 00:08:57,902
THE DAY BEFORE PHOTO DAY!

148
00:08:57,936 --> 00:09:00,939
YOU CAN PHOTOSHOP THAT OUT.

149
00:09:05,543 --> 00:09:07,111
SOMEONE'S IN A GOOD MOOD.

150
00:09:07,145 --> 00:09:09,681
SOMEONE'S HAD THE BEST DAY IN A LONG TIME!

151
00:09:09,714 --> 00:09:12,483
I SHOULD'VE APOLOGIZED MONTHS AGO.

152
00:09:12,517 --> 00:09:16,087
IT'S ALL ABOUT KNOWING WHAT YOU WANT, AND THEN GOING FOR IT.

153
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:17,188
(PHONE RINGS)

154
00:09:21,526 --> 00:09:22,026
HELLO?

155
00:09:23,294 --> 00:09:24,362
HEY, IT'S ME.

156
00:09:27,999 --> 00:09:28,466
HEY YOU.

157
00:09:29,801 --> 00:09:32,070
HEY AH, LISTEN WHAT ARE YOU DOING THIS WEEKEND?

158
00:09:32,103 --> 00:09:35,273
THIS WEEKEND? I DON'T KNOW. WHY?

159
00:09:35,306 --> 00:09:38,676
I DON'T KNOW I WAS THINKIN' MAYBE IF YOU WANTED

160
00:09:38,710 --> 00:09:41,613
WE COULD CATCH A MOVIE ON FRIDAY?

161
00:09:41,646 --> 00:09:44,048
UH - YEAH, SURE SOUNDS GREAT.

162
00:09:44,682 --> 00:09:45,950
REALLY? OKAY.

163
00:09:47,518 --> 00:09:50,188
I'LL SEE YOU TOMORROW AT SCHOOL.

164
00:09:53,391 --> 00:09:56,127
OKAY, SEAN CAMERON JUST ASKED ME OUT.

165
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:59,664
REMIND ME, DID LAST YEAR EVEN HAPPEN? THIS IS INCREDIBLE!

166
00:09:59,697 --> 00:10:00,531
I GUESS...

167
00:10:01,799 --> 00:10:05,503
NO, IT'S PERFECT. IT COULDN'T BE BETTER IF I WANTED IT TO BE.

168
00:10:05,536 --> 00:10:07,105
BUT WHAT ABOUT JIMMY?

169
00:10:07,138 --> 00:10:10,074
WHAT'LL HE DO WHEN HE HEARS YOU'RE DATING SEAN?

170
00:10:10,108 --> 00:10:11,976
I'M NOT DATING ANYONE.

171
00:10:12,010 --> 00:10:14,612
AND I'M NOT JIMMY'S GIRLFRIEND.

172
00:10:15,146 --> 00:10:20,018
I KNOW, BUT MAYBE YOU SHOULD JUST KEEP A LOW PROFILE FOR A BIT -

173
00:10:20,051 --> 00:10:25,990
TER, ONE DAY, WHEN A GUY LIKES YOU, YOU'LL UNDERSTAND HOW THIS WORKS.

174
00:10:26,324 --> 00:10:28,660
I DIDN'T MEAN IT LIKE THAT -

175
00:10:41,472 --> 00:10:43,107
ISAACS.

176
00:10:43,141 --> 00:10:44,776
HEY, SPINNER...

177
00:10:44,809 --> 00:10:46,711
KENDRA MASON. DO YOU NOW HER?

178
00:10:46,744 --> 00:10:50,114
SHE'S SHORT, DARK HAIR, CARTOON FREAK.

179
00:10:50,148 --> 00:10:52,016
UH - YEAH. WHY?

180
00:10:52,050 --> 00:10:54,085
SHE SEEMS TO KNOW YOU.

181
00:10:54,118 --> 00:10:56,788
SHE WOULDN'T STOP TALKING ABOUT YOU JUST NOW.

182
00:10:56,821 --> 00:10:58,489
REALLY? COOL.

183
00:11:00,158 --> 00:11:01,092
NOT COOL.

184
00:11:02,193 --> 00:11:06,464
SEE, HER LAST NAME IS MASON. MY LAST NAME IS MASON.

185
00:11:07,632 --> 00:11:10,101
GEE, WHAT'S THE CONNECTION?

186
00:11:11,135 --> 00:11:13,304
YOU'RE BROTHER AND SISTER?

187
00:11:13,338 --> 00:11:14,572
BUT SHE'S -

188
00:11:14,605 --> 00:11:16,207
-ADOPTED, MORON.

189
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,209
AND ONLY IN GRADE SEVEN.

190
00:11:18,242 --> 00:11:22,513
SO, GO NEAR HER, I TURN YOUR GLASSES INTO CONTACTS.

191
00:11:24,415 --> 00:11:26,117
TODAY IS PHOTO DAY.

192
00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:28,619
CLASSES WILL BE CALLED DOWN INDIVIDUALLY.

193
00:11:28,653 --> 00:11:31,322
HEY, SEX-KITTEN. HOT OUTFIT.

194
00:11:31,356 --> 00:11:35,293
NOT LOOKING BAD EITHER, MICHALCHUK.

195
00:11:35,326 --> 00:11:37,628
UH, WHAT WAS THAT?

196
00:11:37,662 --> 00:11:39,597
WHAT WAS WHAT?

197
00:11:39,630 --> 00:11:41,666
THAT LITTLE ROLLING TRICK YOU DID WITH YOUR EYES.

198
00:11:41,699 --> 00:11:43,101
THAT'S MY MOVE.

199
00:11:43,134 --> 00:11:45,069
IT WAS NOTHING.

200
00:11:46,504 --> 00:11:48,740
WE WERE TALKING ABOUT ASH'S DATE WITH SEAN ON FRIDAY,

201
00:11:48,773 --> 00:11:51,309
AND ASH SAID SOMETHING MEAN TO ME.

202
00:11:51,342 --> 00:11:52,777
YOU'RE KIDDING.

203
00:11:52,810 --> 00:11:54,812
A DATE? ASHLEY AND SEAN.

204
00:11:55,613 --> 00:11:57,415
SO? THEY'RE JUST GOING TO A MOVIE -

205
00:11:57,448 --> 00:11:59,684
SO JIMMY'S STILL TOTALLY IN LOVE WITH HER.

206
00:11:59,717 --> 00:12:01,753
AND SHE MADE HIM THINK THERE'S SOME HOPE.

207
00:12:01,786 --> 00:12:03,354
I KNEW THIS WOULD HAPPEN -

208
00:12:03,388 --> 00:12:04,722
PAIGE, C'MON.

209
00:12:04,756 --> 00:12:07,358
SHE DOESN'T CARE WHAT SHE DID. SHE'S PLAYING ALL OF US.

210
00:12:07,392 --> 00:12:08,226
SHE'S NOT.

211
00:12:10,361 --> 00:12:12,563
YOU'RE RIGHT SHE'S NOT.

212
00:12:12,597 --> 00:12:16,100
NOT ANY MORE. I'M GONNA MAKE SURE OF THAT.

213
00:12:18,503 --> 00:12:20,738
ALRIGHT SO NOW WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO IS WE TAKE SOME DRY ICE

214
00:12:20,772 --> 00:12:23,241
AND WE GONNA PLACE IT IN WATER.

215
00:12:23,274 --> 00:12:26,544
OKAY. THIS EXPERIMENT WILL ILLUSTRATE THE SUBLIMATION PROCESS.

216
00:12:26,577 --> 00:12:28,646
WE HAVE FROZEN CARBON DIOXIDE,

217
00:12:28,679 --> 00:12:32,750
OR DRY ICE, AND BASICALLY IT GETS DESTROYED BY THE WATER.

218
00:12:35,787 --> 00:12:40,224
GEE THAT KIND OF REMINDS ME OF TWO OTHER ELEMENTS.

219
00:12:40,258 --> 00:12:42,093
THIS IS ASHLEY KERWIN.

220
00:12:45,830 --> 00:12:48,566
AND THIS IS JIMMY BROOKS.

221
00:12:48,599 --> 00:12:50,301
AND THAT'S REALLY FUNNY, PAIGE.

222
00:12:50,334 --> 00:12:51,636
YOU KNOW WHAT I HEARD.

223
00:12:51,669 --> 00:12:52,737
FRIDAY NIGHT.

224
00:12:52,770 --> 00:12:56,307
ASHLEY. A DATE. NOT YOU. GEE, GUESS WHO?

225
00:12:57,642 --> 00:13:00,378
PAIGE, JIMMY - THE EXPERIMENT, PLEASE?

226
00:13:00,411 --> 00:13:02,814
OBSERVE AND TAKE NOTES. OKAY?

227
00:13:10,855 --> 00:13:13,925
I FINALLY MEET THE GIRL OF MY DREAMS. SO CUTE.

228
00:13:13,958 --> 00:13:15,660
SO INTO THE SAME THINGS I AM.

229
00:13:15,693 --> 00:13:17,428
AND SO RELATED TO SASQUATCH.

230
00:13:17,462 --> 00:13:19,464
JUST FORGET ABOUT HER.

231
00:13:19,497 --> 00:13:21,699
LOOK THERE SHE IS. COME ON.

232
00:13:21,732 --> 00:13:22,900
TOBY LET'S GO.

233
00:13:23,968 --> 00:13:28,873
FINE, WIPE THE DROOL OFF YOUR CHIN.

234
00:13:28,906 --> 00:13:32,410
HI TOBY, WATCH ASHUHARA LAST NIGHT?

235
00:13:32,443 --> 00:13:34,278
YEAH. I LOVE ASHUHARA.

236
00:13:35,413 --> 00:13:37,482
ME TOO. SO - LUNCH TODAY?

237
00:13:39,217 --> 00:13:40,218
YEAH, LUNCH.

238
00:13:45,556 --> 00:13:47,692
SORRY TO BREAK THIS UP.

239
00:13:47,725 --> 00:13:50,428
BIG FOOT, IS HEADING THIS WAY.

240
00:13:53,297 --> 00:13:53,831
LET'S GO.

241
00:13:57,535 --> 00:13:58,202
COME ON.

242
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:10,548
SEAN CAMERON.

243
00:14:12,483 --> 00:14:13,551
JIMMY BROOKS.

244
00:14:14,552 --> 00:14:16,354
THOUGHT ME AND YOU WERE COOL, MAN.

245
00:14:16,387 --> 00:14:18,456
THERE IS NO ME AND YOU.

246
00:14:18,489 --> 00:14:19,423
FINE BY ME.

247
00:14:24,362 --> 00:14:28,566
ONE WARNING THOUGH. YOU STAY AWAY FROM MY GIRL.

248
00:14:30,434 --> 00:14:31,903
WHAT'RE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

249
00:14:31,936 --> 00:14:34,472
ASH AND I ARE A THING AGAIN.

250
00:14:35,473 --> 00:14:35,873
REALLY?

251
00:14:36,474 --> 00:14:37,475
YEAH REALLY.

252
00:14:39,810 --> 00:14:42,513
I GUESS I HAVE TO ASK HER THAT. WHEN I TAKE HER OUT ON FRIDAY.

253
00:14:45,850 --> 00:14:48,553
HEY, HEY TAKE IT EASY.

254
00:14:52,757 --> 00:14:54,325
YOU ALRIGHT?

255
00:14:54,358 --> 00:14:55,893
YEAH I'M FINE.

256
00:14:56,694 --> 00:14:59,630
IF JIMMY KNOWS WHAT'S GOOD FOR HIM.

257
00:15:05,803 --> 00:15:06,637
HEY JIMMY.

258
00:15:07,838 --> 00:15:10,007
DON'T TALK TO ME YOU SLUT.

259
00:15:14,579 --> 00:15:16,447
WHAT DID YOU SAY?

260
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,883
THAT'S THE WORD FOR GIRLS WHO CHEAT ON THEIR BOYFRIENDS.

261
00:15:18,916 --> 00:15:20,017
YOU'RE NOT MY BOYFRIEND.

262
00:15:20,051 --> 00:15:22,486
WELL I WAS LAST YEAR WHEN YOU MESSED AROUND WITH SEAN

263
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:25,456
NOW YOU WANNA DO IT ALL OVER AGAIN.

264
00:15:33,464 --> 00:15:37,001
ATTENTION, WOULD MRS. CHIDLOW'S GRADE SEVEN HOME ROOM,

265
00:15:37,034 --> 00:15:41,973
AND MS. KWAN'S GRADE EIGHTS, PLEASE HEAD TO THE GYM.

266
00:15:42,006 --> 00:15:45,276
PERFECT, THANKS. WHO'S NEXT?

267
00:15:46,644 --> 00:15:49,547
SO YOU THINK THIS LOOK WORKS? I WENT FOR SHARP. YET CASUAL.

268
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:52,383
YOU LOOK GREAT, LIBERTY.

269
00:15:57,622 --> 00:15:59,924
(CHICKEN SOUNDS)

270
00:15:59,957 --> 00:16:01,559
SHUT UP.

271
00:16:01,592 --> 00:16:03,027
I'M TRYING TO HELP YOU, TOBY.

272
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:04,562
YOU LIKE HER. SHE LIKES YOU.

273
00:16:04,595 --> 00:16:06,497
HER BROTHER LIKES TO MAIM AND KILL.

274
00:16:06,530 --> 00:16:08,399
WITH HIS TEETH.

275
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:12,470
SPINNER ALMOST CAUGHT ME TALKING TO KENDRA EARLIER.

276
00:16:12,503 --> 00:16:13,571
AND?

277
00:16:13,604 --> 00:16:15,606
AND I DON'T WANT TO DIE.

278
00:16:26,584 --> 00:16:28,653
IF YOU WORRY ABOUT BLINKING, HAZEL, YOU'LL BLINK.

279
00:16:28,686 --> 00:16:30,354
JUST TRUST THE CAMERA.

280
00:16:30,388 --> 00:16:31,856
GUYS I'M SO GLAD I FOUND YOU.

281
00:16:31,889 --> 00:16:34,091
I THINK MAYBE I MADE A BIG MISTAKE, ABOUT SEAN, AND -

282
00:16:34,125 --> 00:16:37,128
THERE'S NO ROOM AT THIS TABLE.

283
00:16:37,161 --> 00:16:38,863
OH. UM, I THOUGHT -

284
00:16:38,896 --> 00:16:40,197
YOU THOUGHT WRONG.

285
00:16:41,632 --> 00:16:45,436
THE KEY IS TO THINK ABOUT SOMEONE REALLT HOT. LIKE BRAD PITT.

286
00:16:45,469 --> 00:16:46,704
YOU'LL KEEP YOUR EYES OPEN

287
00:16:46,737 --> 00:16:49,740
AND HAVE A GENUINE SMILE ON YOUR FACE.

288
00:16:49,774 --> 00:16:51,709
WHAT WAS THAT ALL ABOUT?

289
00:16:51,742 --> 00:16:52,610
NOTHING.

290
00:16:53,744 --> 00:16:56,747
ARE YOU SURE? ASH LOOKED UPSET.

291
00:16:56,781 --> 00:16:58,849
HON. IT'S SIMPLE, REALLY.

292
00:17:01,018 --> 00:17:02,953
FOUR YEARS OF HIGH SCHOOL.

293
00:17:02,987 --> 00:17:06,590
WILL YOU SPEND THEM COOL, WITH ALL OF US?

294
00:17:06,924 --> 00:17:10,961
OR AS A BIG OUTCAST LOSER, WITH ONE OF HER.

295
00:17:10,995 --> 00:17:12,596
YOU DECIDE.

296
00:17:27,478 --> 00:17:29,814
TAKE THIS. I'M DONE WITH IT.

297
00:17:29,847 --> 00:17:32,550
WHERE WERE YOU AT LUNCH?

298
00:17:32,583 --> 00:17:34,785
LUNCH? I HAD SOME WORK TO DO.

299
00:17:35,853 --> 00:17:38,789
REALLY. AND WHAT ABOUT THE GYM EARLIER?

300
00:17:38,823 --> 00:17:41,125
YOU IGNORED ME THEN, TOO.

301
00:17:41,158 --> 00:17:42,927
I DON'T GET IT. WHAT DID I DO WRONG?

302
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:47,565
IT'S JUST, YOU'RE IN GRADE SEVEN, I'M IN GRADE EIGHT.

303
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:53,604
AND WE CAN'T BE FRIENDS? WHY NOT?

304
00:17:55,473 --> 00:17:57,475
YOU'RE AFRAID OF MY BROTHER.

305
00:17:57,508 --> 00:17:58,509
NO -

306
00:17:58,542 --> 00:18:02,613
LOOK ME IN THE EYE, AND TELL ME THAT'S NOT IT.

307
00:18:05,015 --> 00:18:05,950
YOU COWARD.

308
00:18:14,625 --> 00:18:15,459
HEY.

309
00:18:16,393 --> 00:18:18,763
FRIDAY NIGHT. WE CAN SEE WHATEVER YOU WANT.

310
00:18:18,796 --> 00:18:20,464
YOU KNOW, IT'S UP TO YOU.

311
00:18:20,498 --> 00:18:21,632
OKAY GREAT.

312
00:18:23,501 --> 00:18:28,172
BUT, I WAS WONDERING - WOULD YOU HATE ME IF I POSTPONED?

313
00:18:29,607 --> 00:18:31,842
YOU DON'T WANNA GO OUT WITH ME, DO YOU?

314
00:18:31,876 --> 00:18:32,610
I DO BUT-

315
00:18:33,477 --> 00:18:36,747
BUT YOU'RE SEEING JIMMY AGAIN. RIGHT?

316
00:18:37,281 --> 00:18:40,518
THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH JIMMY.

317
00:18:47,892 --> 00:18:52,229
DOES IT HAVE TO DO WITH PAIGE AND - YEAH WHATEVER...

318
00:19:03,641 --> 00:19:05,576
THAT WENT WELL.

319
00:19:34,672 --> 00:19:35,139
SPINNER.

320
00:19:37,741 --> 00:19:39,677
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

321
00:19:39,710 --> 00:19:41,278
I WANT TO TALK TO YOUR SISTER.

322
00:19:41,312 --> 00:19:43,247
ISAACS. MOVE ON. NOW.

323
00:19:49,086 --> 00:19:50,087
NO.

324
00:19:50,621 --> 00:19:51,622
NO?

325
00:19:52,356 --> 00:19:53,557
NO.

326
00:19:54,491 --> 00:19:56,660
YOU ARE AWARE I COULD RIP OUT YOUR BOWEL

327
00:19:56,694 --> 00:19:58,062
AND EAT IT FOR BREAKFAST?

328
00:19:58,095 --> 00:20:01,098
YEAH. I'M WILLING TO TAKE THAT RISK.

329
00:20:06,203 --> 00:20:09,106
AS LONG AS YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU BREAK HER HEART?

330
00:20:09,139 --> 00:20:10,074
WE'RE COOL.

331
00:20:14,111 --> 00:20:19,183
MESS ME AROUND AGAIN AND I'LL RIP YOUR BOWEL OUT MYSELF, ISAACS.

332
00:20:19,216 --> 00:20:21,051
WANNA GO FOR ICE CREAM?

333
00:20:23,754 --> 00:20:25,689
NICE SWEATSHIRT.

334
00:20:41,705 --> 00:20:42,973
TER, OVER HERE.

335
00:21:07,831 --> 00:21:08,332
MISS.

336
00:21:16,106 --> 00:21:17,675
WHAT A LONG FACE.

337
00:21:17,708 --> 00:21:20,377
A GIRL AS PRETTY AS YOU SHOULD NEVER FROWN.

338
00:21:20,411 --> 00:21:22,646
JUST TAKE THE PICTURE.

339
00:21:23,147 --> 00:21:24,815
NOT UNTIL YOU SMILE.

340
00:21:25,950 --> 00:21:28,018
TAKE THE PICTURE PLEASE.
