DEAN, WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN THE GIRL'S WASHROOM?

3
00:00:16,773 --> 00:00:18,708
I THOUGHT I'D SAY HI.

4
00:00:19,042 --> 00:00:20,243
OKAY.

5
00:00:20,276 --> 00:00:24,013
RELAX, WE HAD A GOOD TIME AT THAT PARTY TOGETHER, DIDN'T WE?

6
00:00:24,047 --> 00:00:24,547
DEAN, YOU -

00:00:24,581 --> 00:00:25,548
I WHAT?

8
00:00:25,582 --> 00:00:29,819
I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING. JUST HAD A GOOD TIME.

9
00:00:29,853 --> 00:00:31,521
YOU RAPED ME!

10
00:00:31,554 --> 00:00:32,756
YOU WANTED IT, AND DON'T YOU DARE TELL ANYONE ANY DIFFERENT

11
00:00:32,789 --> 00:00:34,491

THAT'S A SERIOUS PRIZE.

38
00:02:03,646 --> 00:02:06,649
THAT'S NOT LIKE WINNING SOME BEACH TOWEL OR MOVIE PASSES.

TERRI, WE COULD MOVE TO L.A.!

40
00:02:18,828 --> 00:02:20,830
PMS COULD TOTALLY WIN THIS.

41
00:02:20,864 --> 00:02:23,633

42
00:02:23,666 --> 00:02:24,901

54
00:02:52,695 --> 00:02:53,630
YOU WON'T REGRET THIS.

62
00:03:18,821 --> 00:03:20,290
THANKS, TERRI.

64
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:24,961

66
00:03:29,866 --> 00:03:32,001
ASHLEY, YOU OKAY TO GO NEXT?

67
00:03:37,307 --> 00:03:39,876
IT HAPPENS TO OTHER PEOPLE.

68
00:03:39,909 --> 00:03:42,912
YOU SAY HOW SAD, YOU SAY POOR THING.

69
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:46,049
BUT WHEN IT'S YOU, IT'S SOMETHING ELSE.

70
00:03:46,082 --> 00:03:47,617
IT'S EVERYTHING.

71
00:03:48,885 --> 00:03:51,154
IT STARTED WITH SOMETHING MINOR,

72
00:03:51,187 --> 00:03:54,691
WENT FROM THERE TO SOMETHING WORSE.

73
00:03:54,724 --> 00:03:56,192
THE FRIENDS YOU LOVED, AND THOUGHT YOU KNEW,

74
00:03:56,225 --> 00:03:58,661
JUST DISAPPEARED.

75
00:03:58,695 --> 00:04:02,699
FELT SO WEIRD, HALF BLESSING, HALF CURSED.

76
00:04:03,232 --> 00:04:05,702
IT HAPPENS TO OTHER PEOPLE,

77
00:04:05,735 --> 00:04:07,737
YOU SAY HOW SAD,

78
00:04:07,770 --> 00:04:09,372
YOU SAY POOR THING.

79
00:04:15,878 --> 00:04:17,780
WHEN GOTTLIEB DAIMLER DIED IN 1900,

80
00:04:17,814 --> 00:04:19,849
HE HAD NO IDEA HOW FAR OR HOW FAST

81
00:04:19,882 --> 00:04:22,785
THE BONE SHAKER MOTORCYCLE HE INVENTED WOULD TAKE US.

82
00:04:22,819 --> 00:04:23,419
THANKS.

83
00:04:24,687 --> 00:04:27,056
GOOD ADDITION TO OUR BIOGRAPHY FILE.

84
00:04:27,090 --> 00:04:30,360
UH, WE HAVE TIME FOR ONE MORE. LIBERTY.

85
00:04:32,929 --> 00:04:34,831
I HAVE SOMETHING DONE ON TIME FOR ONCE,

86
00:04:34,864 --> 00:04:37,734
AND WE RUN OUT OF TIME. TYPICAL.

87
00:04:37,767 --> 00:04:40,136
TYPICAL - IS YOUR PROJECT.

88
00:04:40,169 --> 00:04:41,838
MR. SIMPSON SAID WE COULD DO OUR BIOGRAPHIES

89
00:04:41,871 --> 00:04:43,773
ON ANYBODY THAT WE WANTED.

90
00:04:43,806 --> 00:04:45,174
ANYONE APPROPRIATE.

91
00:04:45,208 --> 00:04:48,444
SOMETHING TELLS ME HUGH HEFFNER DOESN'T COUNT.

92
00:04:48,478 --> 00:04:50,747
AS MY QUEST FOR A WOMAN GOES ON,

93
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:52,849
NAME ME A BETTER ROLE MODEL.

94
00:04:52,882 --> 00:04:55,084
JUST GO FOR LIBERTY, ALREADY.

95
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:58,054
UH! BARF.

96
00:04:59,789 --> 00:05:01,758
THAT'S NOT HOW SHE FEELS ABOUT YOU.

97
00:05:01,791 --> 00:05:04,327
IN FACT, SHE FINDS YOU FASCINATING.

98
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:05,862
JUST WAIT AND SEE.

99
00:05:06,896 --> 00:05:09,032
OKAY, NOW YOU'RE SCARING ME.

100
00:05:09,832 --> 00:05:10,967
FELLOW STUDENTS!

101
00:05:13,136 --> 00:05:15,238
MY HERO ISN'T FROM THE HISTORY BOOKS,

102
00:05:15,271 --> 00:05:16,172
HE'LL BE FAMOUS LATER.

103
00:05:16,205 --> 00:05:17,807
THE NEXT JIM CAREY.

104
00:05:22,812 --> 00:05:23,746
YUCK IT UP, TOBSTER.

105
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:25,381
I'M JT YORK HERE TO TALK TO YOU

106
00:05:25,415 --> 00:05:29,152
ABOUT MY ALL-ROUND FAVORITE SUBJECT - MYSELF.

107
00:05:30,253 --> 00:05:30,920
YOU'LL GOING TO LOVE IT,

108
00:05:30,953 --> 00:05:31,754
BECAUSE IT DON'T GET ANY COOLER

109
00:05:31,788 --> 00:05:35,024
THAN THE YORKMAN - THE EARLY YEARS.

110
00:05:35,925 --> 00:05:40,797
FROM THE VERY BEGINNING I WAS A REAL URBAN COWBOY.

111
00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:41,030
TOBY...

112
00:05:42,331 --> 00:05:42,865
YES.

113
00:05:44,801 --> 00:05:49,338
THEN I WENT ON TO SLAY THE LADIES IN POWDER BLUE RUFFLES.

114
00:05:50,573 --> 00:05:52,909
YOU GAVE HER MY PHOTO ALBUM?

115
00:05:53,409 --> 00:05:53,943
MOI?

116
00:05:55,478 --> 00:05:57,814
THEY CALL ME THE TERMINATOR.

117
00:06:10,893 --> 00:06:11,928
(Laughter)

118
00:06:14,864 --> 00:06:16,199
THE SHOT OF HIM IN THE HEAD GEAR,

119
00:06:16,232 --> 00:06:18,234
I THOUGHT I WAS GOING TO LOSE IT.

120
00:06:18,267 --> 00:06:20,103
YOU BET YOU'RE LOVING HE LADIES.

121
00:06:20,136 --> 00:06:21,504
IT WASN'T THAT FUNNY.

122
00:06:21,537 --> 00:06:22,939
TRUST ME, IT WAS.

123
00:06:23,439 --> 00:06:25,808
IMITATION IS THE LOWEST FORM OF HUMOUR.

124
00:06:25,842 --> 00:06:29,412
IT WASN'T IMITATION. IT WAS A HOMAGE, A TRIBUTE.

125
00:06:29,445 --> 00:06:30,847
YOU WANT TRIBUTE?

126
00:06:32,081 --> 00:06:35,518
YOU TAKE THAT BACK, I DO TOO HAVE FRIENDS, TEN TEXT BOOKS,

127
00:06:35,551 --> 00:06:37,887
A THOUSAND ANIMALS.

128
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:41,424
OH, AND SOMETIMES EVEN MY PARENTS LIKE ME.

129
00:06:45,361 --> 00:06:46,329
LOSER!

130
00:06:46,362 --> 00:06:47,530
FREAK!

131
00:06:50,933 --> 00:06:51,134
GEES.

132
00:06:56,939 --> 00:06:58,341
LA, LA, LA, LA, LA.

133
00:07:00,209 --> 00:07:02,245
LA, LA, LA, LA, LA.

134
00:07:02,278 --> 00:07:02,979
HAZEL!

135
00:07:03,946 --> 00:07:04,881
MUST YOU?

136
00:07:06,249 --> 00:07:08,851
SORRY I'M LATE. I WANTED TO GET INTO THE MOOD.

137
00:07:08,885 --> 00:07:10,887
YOU WORE THAT LAST YEAR,

138
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:13,122
AND THE CHEESY POP TRICKS ARE OVER.

139
00:07:13,156 --> 00:07:15,024
WHY DO YOU HAVE TO BE SO OUT OF TOUCH?

140
00:07:15,057 --> 00:07:17,059
WHY DO YOU HAVE TO BE SO MEAN?

141
00:07:17,093 --> 00:07:19,295
I'M NOT MEAN, I'M RIGHT.

142
00:07:19,328 --> 00:07:20,930
SO, NEW WARDROBE.

143
00:07:21,898 --> 00:07:21,964
NO.

144
00:07:22,999 --> 00:07:23,599
PARDON?

145
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:26,335
WHAT DIDN'T YOU GET? I SAID NO.

146
00:07:26,369 --> 00:07:27,470
TER...

147
00:07:27,503 --> 00:07:28,871
PAIGE DOESN'T UNDERSTAND THAT WORD.

148
00:07:28,905 --> 00:07:29,939
NEVER HAS.

149
00:07:30,306 --> 00:07:32,208
YOU BETTER STOP RIGHT THERE.

150
00:07:32,241 --> 00:07:35,244
OKAY, PAIGE, LOOK, WE ALL WANT TO WIN,

151
00:07:35,278 --> 00:07:38,614
SO LET'S JUST CALM DOWN AND REHEARSE. OKAY?

152
00:07:38,648 --> 00:07:39,582
PAIGE? TER?

153
00:07:55,231 --> 00:07:58,234
I WISH I KNEW JUST WHAT TO DO, YEAH,

154
00:07:59,135 --> 00:08:02,138
TO MAKE THIS SECRET WISH COME TRUE -

155
00:08:04,006 --> 00:08:05,508
UH, PAIGE, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

156
00:08:05,541 --> 00:08:07,143
THIS ISN'T WORKING.

157
00:08:21,524 --> 00:08:22,992
(Singing)

158
00:08:34,971 --> 00:08:36,973
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

159
00:08:37,673 --> 00:08:39,675
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU'RE EVEN ASKING.

160
00:08:39,709 --> 00:08:42,144
WE NEED YOU, IT'S EMBARRASSING.

161
00:08:42,178 --> 00:08:45,114
OH, NO, CAN'T LET THAT HAPPEN. POOR PAIGE.

162
00:08:45,147 --> 00:08:47,216
YOUR POEM IS GREAT, OKAY?

163
00:08:47,717 --> 00:08:50,553
IT'S SOMETHING REAL AND IT MADE ME THINK.

164
00:08:50,586 --> 00:08:53,222
IT DOESN'T MATTER, IT'S GOING TO END UP JUST LIKE LAST YEAR.

165
00:08:53,256 --> 00:08:54,657
IT WON'T! I PROMISE

166
00:08:56,259 --> 00:08:59,161
I WANTED TO TAKE IT SERIOUSLY, BUT YOU GUYS WOULDN'T.

167
00:08:59,195 --> 00:09:02,331
WE CHEESED OUT, BUT THIS TIME WE NEED TO SING

168
00:09:02,365 --> 00:09:03,599
ABOUT REAL STUFF.

169
00:09:03,633 --> 00:09:04,967
LIKE WHAT?

170
00:09:05,001 --> 00:09:05,968
LIKE -

171
00:09:06,002 --> 00:09:09,505
HOW IT FEELS WHEN YOU'RE DUMPED, OR LIKE ABUSE.

172
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:14,443
PAIN. FEELING SAD, WHATEVER YOU WANT.

173
00:09:14,477 --> 00:09:17,413
JUST SO LONG AS IT MEANS SOMETHING.

174
00:09:18,247 --> 00:09:20,950
THIS DOESN'T SOUND LIKE PAIGE.

175
00:09:23,552 --> 00:09:26,489
WITHOUT YOU WE DON'T HAVE A CHANCE?

176
00:09:41,370 --> 00:09:44,640
DO YOU SERIOUSLY THINK WE HAVE A CHANCE?

177
00:09:44,674 --> 00:09:46,542
YOU KNOW WHAT? I DO.

178
00:10:02,591 --> 00:10:03,526
WE HAVE LYRICS?

179
00:10:03,559 --> 00:10:05,594
JUST FINISHED THEM THIS MORNING.

180
00:10:05,628 --> 00:10:09,332
AND I PRINTED OUT NEW COPIES FOR YOU GUYS IN MEDIA IMMERSION.

181
00:10:09,365 --> 00:10:10,499
OH, SNEAKY GIRL.

182
00:10:12,101 --> 00:10:15,438
THE MELODY'S THE SAME BUT THE WORDS ARE WAY MORE POWERFUL NOW.

183
00:10:15,471 --> 00:10:17,273
IT'S KIND OF HEAVY.

184
00:10:18,174 --> 00:10:20,643
WELL, YEAH, I MEAN, IT'S ABOUT RAPE.

185
00:10:20,676 --> 00:10:22,611
PAIGE SAID LAST NIGHT, LET'S MAKE IT REAL.

186
00:10:22,645 --> 00:10:23,679
MY POEM WAS OKAY,

187
00:10:23,713 --> 00:10:25,781
BUT I DID SOME RESEARCH ON-LINE.

188
00:10:25,815 --> 00:10:28,150
DID YOU KNOW THAT BY THE TIME GIRLS REACH UNIVERSITY,

189
00:10:28,184 --> 00:10:30,486
ONE IN FOUR HAS BEEN SEXUALLY ASSAULTED?

190
00:10:30,519 --> 00:10:34,290
YOU TOOK MY BODY AND YOU TORE IT IN HALF?

191
00:10:34,323 --> 00:10:36,125
THIS REALLY ISN'T WORKING FOR ME.

192
00:10:36,158 --> 00:10:39,562
BUT THE STORIES ARE INCREDIBLE. FROM GIRLS OUR AGE.

193
00:10:39,595 --> 00:10:42,498
YOU WOULDN'T BELIEVE SOME OF THE THINGS I READ.

194
00:10:42,531 --> 00:10:45,067
LET'S USE THE ORIGINAL LYRICS, OKAY?

195
00:10:45,101 --> 00:10:46,335
BUT THIS IS WAY MORE INTERESTING.

196
00:10:46,369 --> 00:10:47,536
I AGREE.

197
00:10:47,570 --> 00:10:51,807
UM, I DON'T REALLY CARE. I LIKE THE OTHER VERSION BETTER.

198
00:11:00,850 --> 00:11:02,718
YOUR PAINTING IS MASTERFUL.

199
00:11:02,752 --> 00:11:06,255
IT TOOK AGES TO MIX THAT MANY SHADES OF PINK.

200
00:11:06,288 --> 00:11:07,089
WELL WORTH IT.

201
00:11:07,123 --> 00:11:08,858
I'D LIKE TO WORK ON MY ARTSY SIDE.

202
00:11:08,891 --> 00:11:11,761
BUT THAT MIGHT DISTRACT YOU FROM BEING, YOU KNOW,

203
00:11:11,794 --> 00:11:13,095
DWEEBO-SUPREME.

204
00:11:13,129 --> 00:11:15,264
CAN'T YOU JUST LAY OFF?

205
00:11:15,297 --> 00:11:17,466
OH, LIBERTY CAN DISH IT OUT BUT SHE CAN'T TAKE IT, HUH?

206
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:21,337
I DIDN'T DISH AND I'M NOT A GEEK, JT DORK.

207
00:11:21,370 --> 00:11:22,538
OH, THEM'S FIGHTING WORDS.

208
00:11:22,571 --> 00:11:25,541
YOU WANT FIGHTING WORDS? OKAY, SUCKY-BABY. POOR SPORT...

209
00:11:25,574 --> 00:11:27,209
PRISS-FACE, GOODY-TWO-SHOES.

210
00:11:27,243 --> 00:11:28,144
YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW ME.

211
00:11:28,177 --> 00:11:29,712
YOU DON'T KNOW ONE TRUE THING ABOUT ME.

212
00:11:29,745 --> 00:11:31,514
YOU WANT ONE TRUE THING, LIBERTY?

213
00:11:31,547 --> 00:11:33,616
YOU'RE BORING. B-O-R-I-N-G.

214
00:11:35,618 --> 00:11:37,520
I'M STUNNED. JT SPELLED A WORD.

215
00:11:37,553 --> 00:11:39,488
YOU WANT ANOTHER ONE? FUN - F-U-N

216
00:11:39,522 --> 00:11:40,389
SOMETHING YOU WOULDN'T KNOW

217
00:11:40,423 --> 00:11:43,759
IF IT CAME UP AND BIT YOU IN THE BUTT.

218
00:11:46,595 --> 00:11:48,197
FUN ENOUGH FOR YOU?

219
00:12:09,585 --> 00:12:11,587
YOU WANT TO WIN, RIGHT?

220
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:13,222
NOT WITH THOSE LYRICS. YOU'VE WRITTEN -

221
00:12:13,255 --> 00:12:14,657
I WROTE EXACTLY WHAT WE TALKED ABOUT.

222
00:12:14,690 --> 00:12:15,558
SOMETHING REAL.

223
00:12:15,591 --> 00:12:17,560
BUT YOU'RE ACTING JUST LIKE LAST YEAR.

224
00:12:17,593 --> 00:12:20,162
GIVE IT UP, ASHLEY, OKAY?

225
00:12:20,196 --> 00:12:21,831
TELL ME WHAT'S WRONG WITH THE NEW LYRICS AND I WILL.

226
00:12:21,864 --> 00:12:25,568
SINGING A SONG ABOUT RAPE WILL NOT WIN THE CONTEST.

227
00:12:25,601 --> 00:12:26,836
I THOUGHT WE HAD AN AGREEMENT.

228
00:12:26,869 --> 00:12:28,537
I SAID SOMETHING REAL.

229
00:12:28,571 --> 00:12:29,839
NOT SOMETHING YOU GOT OFF THE NET

230
00:12:29,872 --> 00:12:31,307
AND DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT.

231
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:32,341
I'M ALLOWED TO IMAGINE.

232
00:12:32,374 --> 00:12:34,577
NO, YOU'RE NOT!

233
00:12:42,618 --> 00:12:47,490
AFTER SCHOOL, IN THE MUSIC ROOM. BRING THE RIGHT LYRICS.

234
00:12:57,867 --> 00:12:58,534
LIBERTY!

235
00:12:59,668 --> 00:13:00,870
HOW COULD YOU DO THAT?

236
00:13:00,903 --> 00:13:02,738
GO AWAY, LITTLE MAN.

237
00:13:02,771 --> 00:13:05,474
YOU JUST WROTE GRAFFITI ON MY LOCKER.

238
00:13:05,508 --> 00:13:07,810
I'M EDGY, JT, I'M ON FIRE.

239
00:13:07,843 --> 00:13:08,944
YOU'RE ON SOMETHING.

240
00:13:08,978 --> 00:13:10,513
NO STRANGER TO DANGER, MY FRIEND.

241
00:13:10,546 --> 00:13:12,281
I LAUGH AT AUTHORITY.

242
00:13:12,581 --> 00:13:15,985
MR. YORK! HOLD IT.

243
00:13:16,018 --> 00:13:17,887
DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING TO SAY?

244
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:19,021
ABOUT?

245
00:13:19,054 --> 00:13:21,357
ABOUT THAT LITTLE PIECE OF ART PEOPLE SAW YOU CREATING.

246
00:13:21,390 --> 00:13:23,592
IT WASN'T ME. I DIDN'T DO IT.

247
00:13:26,629 --> 00:13:30,566
MR. RADITCH, I WAS- I WAS TRYING TO ERASE IT.

248
00:13:30,599 --> 00:13:33,402
I DIDN'T PUT IT ON THERE...

249
00:13:33,435 --> 00:13:36,672
COME ON IN GIRLS, TAKE A SEAT.

250
00:13:36,705 --> 00:13:39,708
OKAY, BACK TO THE LORD OF THE FLIES.

251
00:13:40,643 --> 00:13:42,478
HEY, HAVE YOU SEEN JT?

252
00:13:43,412 --> 00:13:47,550
I THINK YOUR LITTLE FRIEND IS IN THE OFFICE WITH MR. RADITCH.

253
00:13:47,583 --> 00:13:48,417
THAT'S IT.

254
00:13:48,984 --> 00:13:49,818
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

255
00:13:49,852 --> 00:13:52,955
SO, THEY'LL CALL HIS MOM. JT'S MOM -

256
00:13:53,822 --> 00:13:54,423
WHAT?

257
00:13:55,057 --> 00:13:55,991
- BATTLE-AX.

258
00:13:56,025 --> 00:13:57,960
THREATEN TO TRANSFER HIM TO A PRIVATE SCHOOL,

259
00:13:57,993 --> 00:13:59,662
IF HE GOT INTO TROUBLE WITH RADITCH AGAIN.

260
00:13:59,695 --> 00:14:02,398
I HOPE YOU SAID GOODBYE.

00:14:39,835 --> 00:14:41,670
POLYPS. OVER-PRACTICE.

269
00:14:43,405 --> 00:14:45,040
BUT WE GO ON TOMORROW.

270
00:14:45,941 --> 00:14:48,377
ASH, YOU'RE SINGING THE SOLO.

271
00:14:48,410 --> 00:14:50,045
AWESOME! SORRY, HAZEL.

WE'RE NOT USING THOSE LYRICS.

277
00:15:12,001 --> 00:15:14,536
PAIGE, IF I'M SINGING, THOSE ARE THE LYRICS I'LL PERFORM.

278
00:15:14,570 --> 00:15:18,641
NO, I CAN'T BELIEVE I WANTED YOU BACK IN THIS BAND!

279
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:26,015
THE SONG IS STRONGER.

280
00:15:26,048 --> 00:15:28,384
ANYONE WITH HALF AN EMOTION WOULD KNOW THAT.

281
00:15:28,417 --> 00:15:30,052
YEAH, WHAT WOULD YOU KNOW ABOUT RAPE?

282
00:15:30,085 --> 00:15:35,090
I RESEARCHED IT, I KNOW A LOT MORE ABOUT IT YOU THAN YOU DO.

283
00:15:37,793 --> 00:15:38,494
PAIGE?

284
00:15:39,695 --> 00:15:41,864
JUST LEAVE ME ALONE, OKAY?

285
00:15:48,604 --> 00:15:49,905
I - I HAD NO IDEA.

286
00:15:51,674 --> 00:15:52,741
I'M SO SORRY.

287
00:15:54,543 --> 00:15:56,612
NOBODY KNOWS. ONLY HAZEL.

288
00:15:58,881 --> 00:16:02,418
I KEEP TRYING TO FORGET, BUT I CAN'T.

289
00:16:02,451 --> 00:16:04,086
HE'S IN MY NIGHTMARES.

290
00:16:06,655 --> 00:16:07,823
HAVE YOU BEEN TO A DOCTOR?

291
00:16:07,856 --> 00:16:09,425
HE WORE A CONDOM.

292
00:16:09,458 --> 00:16:11,393
VERY THOUGHTFUL, HUH?

293
00:16:12,561 --> 00:16:13,629
WHAT ABOUT A COUNSELOR?

294
00:16:13,662 --> 00:16:16,131
I CAN'T! OKAY? I JUST - I CAN'T.

295
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,669
AND I CAN'T PLAY THAT SONG.

296
00:16:20,703 --> 00:16:21,904
I KNOW IT'S A BETTER VERSION, BUT -

297
00:16:21,937 --> 00:16:25,507
SHH... IT'S OKAY. WE'LL PLAY THE OTHER ONE.

298
00:16:25,541 --> 00:16:27,076
IT'S OKAY. IT'S OKAY.

299
00:16:30,646 --> 00:16:33,982
IT'S OKAY. IT'S GOING TO BE OKAY, PAIGE.

300
00:16:40,589 --> 00:16:41,824
THE CUSTODIAL STAFF HAVE REQUESTED

301
00:16:41,857 --> 00:16:44,626
THAT YOU LEAVE A STREAK-FREE SHINE.

302
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:46,595
I COULDN'T REACH YOUR MOTHER, BUT WHEN THIS IS CLEAN,

303
00:16:46,628 --> 00:16:48,464
WE'LL CALL AGAIN.

304
00:16:48,497 --> 00:16:50,632
I DID IT. I'M A VANDAL.

305
00:16:50,666 --> 00:16:53,068
THIS IS NO TIME TO BE COVERING FOR MR. YORK.

306
00:16:53,102 --> 00:16:53,702
I'M NOT COVERING.

307
00:16:53,736 --> 00:16:55,170
IT WAS A BAD THING TO DO.

308
00:16:55,204 --> 00:16:58,040
IT WASN'T BORING, BUT IT WAS PRETTY STUPID.

309
00:16:58,073 --> 00:16:59,908
AND YOU DID THIS? WHY?

310
00:17:01,643 --> 00:17:04,113
I WAS ACTING ON IMPULSE, SIR.

311
00:17:04,146 --> 00:17:06,081
TOLD YOU I DIDN'T DO IT.

312
00:17:06,115 --> 00:17:08,517
IT WAS TRUANT, REBELLIOUS, MISDIRECTED -

313
00:17:08,550 --> 00:17:11,687
OKAY, MR. YORK, YOU ARE FREE TO GO.

314
00:17:21,797 --> 00:17:26,735
WELCOME TO THE PANTENE PRO-VOICE CONTEST.

315
00:17:27,669 --> 00:17:29,838

317
00:17:32,975 --> 00:17:34,510
YEAH, I PROMISE.

318
00:17:35,177 --> 00:17:36,712
I'M SO NERVOUS.

319
00:17:36,745 --> 00:17:38,714
TER, DON'T SWEAT IT, WE'LL BE FINE.

320
00:17:38,747 --> 00:17:42,184
UH-UH, WE'LL BE GREAT. ORIGINAL LYRICS, AND ALL.

321
00:17:42,217 --> 00:17:44,720
AND OUR NEXT BAND IS A GROUP FROM DEGRASSI.

322
00:17:44,753 --> 00:17:46,522
GIVE IT UP FOR PMS.

323
00:17:46,555 --> 00:17:47,823
LET'S GO DO IT.

324
00:17:51,994 --> 00:17:52,828

325
00:18:00,169 --> 00:18:03,906

352
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:28,684
TOTALLY. EVEN CALLED MY PARENTS.

353
00:20:28,717 --> 00:20:31,920

00:20:35,857 --> 00:20:38,894
NAH, YOU FESSED UP. THAT WAS COOL.

357
00:20:40,095 --> 00:20:42,164
JT YORK JUST CALLED ME COOL?

358
00:20:42,197 --> 00:20:44,866
DON'T LET IT GO TO YOUR HEAD.

359
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:46,835
SEE YOU AROUND, RIBBLE.

360
00:20:57,879 --> 00:21:00,849
I GUESS THOSE CALIFORNIA BEACH BOYS WILL HAVE TO WAIT.

361
00:21:00,882 --> 00:21:03,085
YOU KNOW, L.A.'S REALLY NOT THAT GREAT.

362
00:21:03,118 --> 00:21:05,354
IT'S ALL LIKE MINI-MALLS AND FREEWAYS.

363
00:21:05,387 --> 00:21:06,455
YOU WERE ROBBED.

364
00:21:06,488 --> 00:21:08,924
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU ONLY GOT AN HONORABLE MENTION.

365
00:21:08,957 --> 00:21:10,826
SERIOUSLY? YOU LIKED IT?

366
00:21:10,859 --> 00:21:13,261
PAIGE, YOU WERE AWESOME, TRULY.

367
00:21:14,896 --> 00:21:16,231
YOU KNOW, SHE WAS RIGHT THOUGH.

368
00:21:16,264 --> 00:21:17,866
A SONG ABOUT RAPE WILL NEVER COME FIRST.

369
00:21:17,899 --> 00:21:20,836
ESPECIALLY NOT WHEN I'M SINGING IT.

370
00:21:23,972 --> 00:21:25,407
SO, YOU OKAY?

371
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:27,876
I'M READY TO TALK, AT LEAST.

372
00:21:27,909 --> 00:21:30,379
WELL, AS READY AS I'LL EVER BE.
