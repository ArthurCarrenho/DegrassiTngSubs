1
00:00:02,201 --> 00:00:04,503
"WHAT YOU DID CHANGED MY LIFE.

2
00:00:04,536 --> 00:00:06,772
I STILL CAN'T SLEEP WITHOUT MY LIGHT ON.

3
00:00:06,805 --> 00:00:11,743
SOMETIMES I LOOK UNDER THE BED, WORRIED YOU MIGHT BE THERE.

4
00:00:11,777 --> 00:00:14,480
I MADE A MISTAKE GOING UPSTAIRS WITH YOU

5
00:00:14,513 --> 00:00:17,249
BUT DEAN YOU MADE MORE THEN A MISTAKE.

6
00:00:17,282 --> 00:00:18,784
YOU MADE A CHOICE."

7
00:00:19,651 --> 00:00:21,553
AN IMPORTANT DISTINCTION.

8
00:00:21,587 --> 00:00:22,287
WELL, YEAH.

9
00:00:22,321 --> 00:00:24,456
BECAUSE THIS WHOLE THING BELONGS

10
00:00:24,490 --> 00:00:26,558
ON MR. EVIL'S CONSCIENCE.

11
00:00:27,326 --> 00:00:29,361
AND YOUR CONSCIENCE?

12
00:00:29,394 --> 00:00:32,965
I SAID NO, SO HOW COULD I FEEL RESPONSIBLE?

13
00:00:32,998 --> 00:00:35,667
YOU'VE STOPPED BLAMING YOURSELF.

14
00:00:37,569 --> 00:00:38,637
YEAH. I HAVE.

15
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:41,540
EXCELLENT PROGRESS.

16
00:00:41,573 --> 00:00:43,609
AND WE'LL KEEP WORKING ON IT.

17
00:00:43,642 --> 00:00:45,711
SAME TIME, NEXT WEEK?

18
00:00:46,478 --> 00:00:49,615
MISS SAUVE, THERAPY'S GREAT, BUT...

19
00:00:49,648 --> 00:00:51,650
I STRONGLY RECOMMEND WE CONTINUE -

20
00:00:51,683 --> 00:00:53,519
I'LL PENCIL YOU IN ANYWAY.

21
00:00:53,552 --> 00:00:56,388
PENCIL AWAY. BUT IT IS A WASTE OF AN APPOINTMENT.

22
00:00:56,421 --> 00:00:57,589
I'M OVER THIS.

00:01:50,876 --> 00:01:52,778
I'M STUCK IN A BOX!

36
00:01:52,811 --> 00:01:56,515
DOES IT SAY "CAUTION: FREAK INSIDE"?

37
00:01:57,049 --> 00:01:59,785
WHAT?! CAN'T HEAR YOU. BOX!

38
00:02:05,691 --> 00:02:06,758
THANKS.

39
00:02:07,526 --> 00:02:10,596
A LITTLE MIME MAGIC FOR MY MASCOT ROUTINE.

40
00:02:10,629 --> 00:02:11,663
YOU LIKE?

41
00:02:11,697 --> 00:02:12,998
I ALWAYS LIKE YOUR STUFF.

42
00:02:13,031 --> 00:02:14,333
JUST MAKE SURE YOU BRING THAT MAGIC

43
00:02:14,366 --> 00:02:17,603
TO TOMORROW'S BASKETBALL TOURNAMENT.

44
00:02:17,636 --> 00:02:19,037
WAIT A MINUTE, DID YOU JUST TALK TO ME

45
00:02:19,071 --> 00:02:21,607
WITHOUT SAYING MIDGET, TWERP OR DWEEB?

46
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:24,042
I THINK I DID. LUCKY YOU.

47
00:02:27,546 --> 00:02:28,814
HEY BOYS.

48
00:02:29,514 --> 00:02:31,617
OH, HEY, PAIGE.

49
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:34,786
SPIN? I LOVE THE ROOTS. TRES COOL.

50
00:02:36,755 --> 00:02:37,623
IT'S A COMPETITIVE MARKET.

51
00:02:37,656 --> 00:02:40,859
BUT UNISEX COLOGNE DOUBLES OUR BUYERS.

52
00:02:40,892 --> 00:02:44,429
'SHARE YOUR SCENT. SING A DUET.'

53
00:02:44,830 --> 00:02:46,698
I'M IMPRESSED.

54
00:02:47,733 --> 00:02:49,601
YOU GUYS THOUGHT THROUGH YOUR MOCK PRODUCT AND CAMPAIGN WELL.

55
00:02:49,635 --> 00:02:50,602
AND FINISHED FIRST.

56
00:02:50,636 --> 00:02:52,704
SO - TIME TO GO ON TO PART TWO OF THE PROJECT

57
00:02:52,738 --> 00:02:54,706
AND FILM YOUR AD.

58
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:56,775
IT'LL BE GREAT. TOTAL CHEESE MUSICAL.

59
00:02:56,808 --> 00:02:58,844
FUN AND FABULOUS.

60
00:02:58,877 --> 00:03:02,114
SOUNDS GREAT. CAMERA'S ALL YOURS.

61
00:03:02,147 --> 00:03:03,615
YOU'RE SURE YOU DON'T WANT TO DIRECT?

62
00:03:03,649 --> 00:03:06,618
POSITIVE. LISTEN, I TRUST YOU.

63
00:03:06,652 --> 00:03:09,488
YOUR LOVE BRINGS TEARS TO MY EYES.

64
00:03:09,521 --> 00:03:13,058
JUST WISH EVERYONE COULD BE AS LUCKY.

65
00:03:17,796 --> 00:03:18,930
NICE ONE, BOYFRIEND.

66
00:03:18,964 --> 00:03:21,800
WHY, THANK YOU, GIRLFRIEND.

67
00:03:25,037 --> 00:03:26,338
(Cheering) BLUE AND GOLD

68
00:03:26,805 --> 00:03:28,774
SHOOT FOR TWO!

69
00:03:28,807 --> 00:03:30,142
LET'S GO!

70
00:03:30,175 --> 00:03:31,376
(Cheering)

71
00:03:34,946 --> 00:03:38,784
THAT WAS GREAT GUYS. TAKE A BREAK.

72
00:03:39,451 --> 00:03:41,687
PAIGE, THAT CHOREOGRAPHY KILLS.

73
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:42,688
I TRY.

74
00:03:42,721 --> 00:03:45,490
THE CROWD TOMORROW WON'T KNOW WHAT HIT THEM.

75
00:03:45,524 --> 00:03:48,627
SPINNER. FINALLY DECIDED TO JOIN THE SPIRIT SQUAD?

76
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:49,861
DREAM ON.

77
00:03:49,895 --> 00:03:54,566
WE JUST GOT THE FINAL TEAM'S NAME IN FOR TOMORROW'S TOURNEY.

78
00:03:54,599 --> 00:03:55,067
BARDELL.

79
00:03:56,101 --> 00:03:57,936
YOUR BOYFRIEND'S BACK.

80
00:04:02,774 --> 00:04:05,744
HAZEL. HE'S COMING TO MY SCHOOL.

81
00:04:14,686 --> 00:04:17,522
PAIGE, BACK SO SOON?

82
00:04:24,096 --> 00:04:24,696
YEAH.

83
00:04:25,831 --> 00:04:30,535
I WANTED TO ASK ABOUT PRESSING CHARGES... AGAINST DEAN.

84
00:04:31,203 --> 00:04:32,137
WOW - OKAY.

85
00:04:34,706 --> 00:04:38,510
WE'LL HAVE SET UP A MEETING WITH YOUR MOM.

86
00:04:38,543 --> 00:04:41,713
NO, I KNOW. BUT WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENS?

87
00:04:42,914 --> 00:04:46,017
WELL, THE POLICE WILL GET INVOLVED,

88
00:04:46,051 --> 00:04:48,954
YOU'LL PROBABLY BE ASKED TO TESTIFY.

89
00:04:48,987 --> 00:04:50,856
AND THEN WE SEND HIM TO JAIL?

90
00:04:50,889 --> 00:04:53,759
IF THERE'S ENOUGH EVIDENCE, YES.

91
00:04:53,792 --> 00:04:55,927
WELL I HAD ALL THOSE DOCTOR'S EXAMS.

92
00:04:55,961 --> 00:04:58,563
AND THEY REASSURED US YOU WERE INJURY-FREE,

93
00:04:58,597 --> 00:05:01,633
AND THAT YOU HADN'T DEVELOPED ANY STD'S, BUT-

94
00:05:01,666 --> 00:05:03,735
THEY'RE NOT EVIDENCE.

95
00:05:05,837 --> 00:05:07,572
UNFORTUNATELY, PAIGE,

96
00:05:08,073 --> 00:05:10,776
THE LONGER YOU WAIT TO REPORT,

97
00:05:11,777 --> 00:05:14,813
THE LESS PHYSICAL EVIDENCE THERE IS.

98
00:05:14,846 --> 00:05:18,817
WE DON'T HAVE A DNA SAMPLES, OR PHOTOS OF BRUISING.

99
00:05:19,518 --> 00:05:20,619
SO, WHAT?

100
00:05:20,652 --> 00:05:24,890
I GO TO COURT, TELL THE TRUTH - AND I COULD STILL LOSE?

101
00:05:24,923 --> 00:05:25,657
POSSIBLY.

102
00:05:26,191 --> 00:05:28,059
BUT THAT'S SO UNFAIR!

103
00:05:28,093 --> 00:05:29,928
HOLD ON...

104
00:05:30,762 --> 00:05:32,931
DON'T GET TOO DISCOURAGED.

105
00:05:32,964 --> 00:05:34,833
IF THIS IS WHAT YOU WANT,

106
00:05:34,866 --> 00:05:37,936
THEN WE WILL MAKE THE BEST CASE WE CAN.

107
00:05:39,604 --> 00:05:42,240
FORGET IT. I JUST THOUGHT I'D ASK.

108
00:05:49,815 --> 00:05:51,616
WOW. THAT'S BRIGHT.

109
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:56,087
MARCO'S OBSESSED WITH BOLLYWOOD MUSICALS.

110
00:05:57,189 --> 00:05:58,790
SEEMED FUN.

111
00:06:00,158 --> 00:06:03,528
A SURPRISE FOR LA SIGNORINA...

112
00:06:03,929 --> 00:06:06,231
IT'S MY MOM'S EGGPLANT PARMESAN.

113
00:06:06,264 --> 00:06:08,033
I KNOW HOW MUCH YOU LIKE IT SO...

114
00:06:08,066 --> 00:06:09,935
WOW. THANKS.

115
00:06:09,968 --> 00:06:13,271
AND THERE'S ENOUGH HERE FOR THE BOTH OF YOU -

116
00:06:13,305 --> 00:06:16,908
SO I'LL LEAVE YOU LADIES TO YOUR GIRL TALK.

117
00:06:19,244 --> 00:06:22,581
THIS IS THE PERFECT VEGETARIAN DISH.

118
00:06:22,614 --> 00:06:24,916
FROM YOUR PERFECT BOYFRIEND.

119
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:26,785
REALLY, COULD YOU TWO BE MORE MEANT FOR EACH OTHER?

120
00:06:53,111 --> 00:06:56,281
HEY, COME ON, WIND-TUNNEL MAN? THAT'S COMIC GOLD.

121
00:06:56,314 --> 00:06:59,851
HELLO, I THOUGHT MIMES WERE SUPPOSED TO BE SILENT.

122
00:06:59,885 --> 00:07:01,620
PAIGE, ARE YOU MAD AT ME?

123
00:07:01,653 --> 00:07:03,288
DID I DO SOMETHING WRONG, LIKE AT PRACTICE?

124
00:07:03,321 --> 00:07:05,724
NO, FOR ONCE IT'S NOT ABOUT YOU.

125
00:07:05,757 --> 00:07:07,325
IT'S ABOUT ME, NOT CHEERING TOMORROW.

126
00:07:07,359 --> 00:07:09,794
WHAT? WE NEED YOU.

127
00:07:09,828 --> 00:07:10,862
TOO BAD. DEAL WITH IT.

128
00:07:10,896 --> 00:07:11,730
WHY?

129
00:07:13,632 --> 00:07:15,100
IT'S REALLY NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS.

130
00:07:15,133 --> 00:07:16,668
IF I'M SWEATING IN SOME MASCOT SUIT

131
00:07:16,701 --> 00:07:20,705
AND YOU'RE HOME WATCHING TV - IT IS MY BUSINESS.

132
00:07:21,373 --> 00:07:23,842
SOMEONE'S COMING TOMORROW.

133
00:07:23,875 --> 00:07:25,377
FROM BARDELL.

134
00:07:25,410 --> 00:07:27,245
AND I - CAN'T SEE HIM.

135
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:31,182
DID HE DUMP YOU OR SOMETHING?

136
00:07:31,216 --> 00:07:32,951
OR SOMETHING...

137
00:07:33,752 --> 00:07:37,022
WELL JUST, GIVE HIM SOME OF YOUR WORLD-FAMOUS ATTITUDE.

138
00:07:37,055 --> 00:07:38,723
SHOW HIM WHO'S BOSS.

139
00:07:39,824 --> 00:07:44,329
IS THAT WHY YOU'RE STALKING ME? TO GIVE ME A PEP TALK?

140
00:07:50,368 --> 00:07:53,738
SO THEN YOU LEAN IN, CLOSE, ROMANTIC -

141
00:07:54,372 --> 00:07:56,207
AND YOU SAY YOUR LINE.

142
00:07:56,841 --> 00:07:58,877
ALL RIGHT, LET'S DO IT.

143
00:08:01,012 --> 00:08:01,813
ACTION!

144
00:08:04,716 --> 00:08:07,152
CUT! YOU'RE OUT OF FRAME.

145
00:08:07,185 --> 00:08:10,388
WELL IT'S HARD TO KNOW WHERE TO STOP WITHOUT HEATHER HERE.

146
00:08:10,422 --> 00:08:12,090
I'LL STAND IN, OKAY?

147
00:08:17,128 --> 00:08:17,729
ACTION.

148
00:08:21,333 --> 00:08:23,835
GREAT. NOW, ARM BEHIND ME,

149
00:08:23,868 --> 00:08:27,205
RAISE THE PERFUME, AND SAY...

150
00:08:27,238 --> 00:08:30,709
'SHARE YOUR SCENT - SING A DUET.'

151
00:08:40,251 --> 00:08:43,254
YEAH, THAT WAS GREAT, LET'S MOVE ON.

152
00:08:55,467 --> 00:08:56,735
(ALARM CLOCK)

153
00:09:14,352 --> 00:09:15,954
ARE YOU GOING TO BE OKAY?

154
00:09:15,987 --> 00:09:18,757
I'M STAYING FAR AWAY FROM HIM.

155
00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:22,093
HEY PAIGE, ARE WE DOING THAT ELEVATOR FORMATION FIRST?

156
00:09:22,127 --> 00:09:23,461
OR... PAIGE?

157
00:09:31,436 --> 00:09:32,837
LET'S GO.

158
00:09:36,408 --> 00:09:37,742
SPIRIT. HOLD UP.

159
00:09:40,512 --> 00:09:41,479
SO WHAT'S IN TODAY'S PLAN?

160
00:09:41,513 --> 00:09:43,214
A LITTLE RAH-RAH CHEERING,

161
00:09:43,248 --> 00:09:46,785
OR ANOTHER SERENADE FROM YOUR LITTLE GIRL-BAND?

162
00:09:46,818 --> 00:09:47,886
THIS IS MY SCHOOL.

163
00:09:47,919 --> 00:09:52,057
AND I DON'T WANT TO SEE YOU, OR TALK TO YOU AGAIN.

164
00:09:56,261 --> 00:09:58,763
LIGHTEN UP. WE HAD FUN.

165
00:10:01,466 --> 00:10:02,300
FUN?

166
00:10:03,134 --> 00:10:05,904
YOU THINK WHAT YOU DID TO ME WAS FUN?!

167
00:10:05,937 --> 00:10:07,505
THE NIGHT OF THE PARTY.

168
00:10:07,539 --> 00:10:09,040
YOU WERE THERE.

169
00:10:09,074 --> 00:10:11,810
WHO DID SPIRIT COME TO SEE?

170
00:10:12,510 --> 00:10:13,845
RIGHT. ME.

171
00:10:15,346 --> 00:10:16,915
I SAID NO -

172
00:10:16,948 --> 00:10:19,017
EVERYONE THERE SAW A GIRL WHO WANTED IT.

173
00:10:19,050 --> 00:10:19,884
BAD.

174
00:10:20,552 --> 00:10:22,487
AND SHE GOT IT.

175
00:10:24,522 --> 00:10:28,493
GO SHAKE YOUR LITTLE POMPOMS AND LOOK CUTE, SPIRIT.

176
00:10:28,526 --> 00:10:30,328
I GOT A GAME.

177
00:10:39,604 --> 00:10:40,905
SO I WANT TO MOVE IT OVER.

178
00:10:40,939 --> 00:10:41,906
SO LETS DO THAT.

179
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:43,108
YEAH OKAY.

180
00:10:43,141 --> 00:10:44,209
HEY, MARCO.

181
00:10:44,242 --> 00:10:45,376
HEY.

182
00:10:45,410 --> 00:10:48,580
SO YOU'RE READY FOR YOUR DIRECTING DEBUT?

183
00:10:48,613 --> 00:10:49,481
YEAH.

184
00:10:49,514 --> 00:10:53,051
AND I'VE GOT A BIT OF A NEW DIRECTION.

185
00:10:53,852 --> 00:10:55,320
WHO DIED?

186
00:10:55,353 --> 00:10:56,955
IT'S CALLED MINIMALISM.

187
00:10:56,988 --> 00:10:59,057
I'D CALL IT BORING.

188
00:10:59,858 --> 00:11:02,293
WHAT HAPPENED TO HEATHER? AND ALL THE DANCING GIRLS?

189
00:11:02,327 --> 00:11:03,895
UNNECESSARY.

190
00:11:03,928 --> 00:11:06,431
DUET WAS GETTING LOST IN ALL THE GLITZ.

191
00:11:06,464 --> 00:11:07,398
OKAY.

192
00:11:08,266 --> 00:11:11,136
IF YOU SAY SO, WE'LL DO IT THIS WAY.

193
00:11:11,169 --> 00:11:13,204
YOU'RE THE DIRECTOR.

194
00:11:13,238 --> 00:11:14,606
YOU'RE FINE WITH IT?

195
00:11:14,639 --> 00:11:18,009
YEAH. WHATEVER YOU WANT. HONEST.

196
00:11:19,377 --> 00:11:22,313
WE RULE! THE TOURNAMENT IS OURS!

197
00:11:22,347 --> 00:11:25,250
BARDELL HAS ABSOLUTELY NO CHANCE.

198
00:11:25,283 --> 00:11:28,186
JIMMY SHOULD CALM DOWN. BARDELL'S A TOUGH TEAM.

199
00:11:28,219 --> 00:11:30,588
WE CAN BEAT THEM.

200
00:11:30,622 --> 00:11:33,892
YOU THINK SO, SPIRIT? GOOD LUCK.

201
00:11:36,161 --> 00:11:38,429
I'LL SEE YOU LATER.

202
00:11:38,963 --> 00:11:40,532
WHAT'S WITH HER?

203
00:11:40,565 --> 00:11:42,467
IS SHE STILL HUNG UP ON DEAN?

204
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:43,635
NO.

205
00:11:43,668 --> 00:11:44,536
COME ON, HAZEL.

206
00:11:44,569 --> 00:11:46,371
I WAS AT THAT PARTY. I KNOW WHAT HAPPENED.

207
00:11:46,404 --> 00:11:47,639
AND WHAT'S THAT?

208
00:11:47,672 --> 00:11:49,407
HE AND PAIGE...

209
00:11:50,074 --> 00:11:53,278
PAIGE DUMPED ME, THEN DID IT WITH HIM.

210
00:11:53,311 --> 00:11:54,646
WHAT IF IT WASN'T LIKE THAT?

211
00:11:54,679 --> 00:11:56,548
WHAT IF SHE SAID NO?

212
00:11:57,615 --> 00:11:58,449
GOOD ONE, HAZEL.

213
00:11:58,483 --> 00:12:01,986
BUT THE ONLY ONE SHE SAYS NO TO IS ME.

214
00:12:05,523 --> 00:12:08,193
DUET. WE ARE AS ONE. WE - SORRY...

215
00:12:14,966 --> 00:12:17,569
MARCO! THAT'S THE SEVENTH TAKE.

216
00:12:18,269 --> 00:12:19,103
I'M SORRY.

217
00:12:20,138 --> 00:12:22,640
IT'S JUST THAT, WHEN I SAY "ABSORB EACH OTHER"?

218
00:12:22,674 --> 00:12:25,610
IT SOUNDS LIKE WE'RE SELLING TAMPONS OR SOMETHING.

219
00:12:25,643 --> 00:12:27,512
ARE YOU MAKING FUN OF MY WRITING?

220
00:12:27,545 --> 00:12:30,615
BUT IT DOESN'T EVEN GO WITH OUR WHOLE CONCEPT.

221
00:12:30,648 --> 00:12:32,584
A DUET WITH ONE PERSON.

222
00:12:34,686 --> 00:12:36,120
I CAN GO FIND SOMEONE RIGHT NOW

223
00:12:36,154 --> 00:12:38,289
AND WE COULD DO THE DANCE LIKE BEFORE.

224
00:12:38,323 --> 00:12:40,158
NO, YOU CAN'T.

225
00:12:40,191 --> 00:12:43,561
I SAID YES TO THIS WHOLE WEIRD CONCEPT,

226
00:12:43,595 --> 00:12:46,464
BUT EVER SINCE THEN YOU'VE BEEN TREATING ME LIKE YOUR SLAVE.

227
00:12:46,497 --> 00:12:49,567
FUNNY CAUSE THAT'S HOW I ALWAYS FEEL AROUND YOU.

228
00:12:49,601 --> 00:12:51,669
YOU MAY NOT LIKE WHAT YOU'RE DOING HERE,

229
00:12:51,703 --> 00:12:54,906
BUT IS WAY BETTER THEN SOME FLAMING-

230
00:12:59,410 --> 00:13:01,613
SO THAT'S WHAT THIS IS ABOUT.

231
00:13:03,181 --> 00:13:06,351
THE FACT THAT I CAN'T BE WHO YOU WANT.

232
00:13:09,053 --> 00:13:10,321
CAN'T OR WON'T?

233
00:13:30,275 --> 00:13:31,709
YOU TOLD SPINNER?

234
00:13:31,743 --> 00:13:34,312
I WANTED HIM TO UNDERSTAND -

235
00:13:34,345 --> 00:13:36,681
WELL, WHAT DID HE SAY?

236
00:13:36,714 --> 00:13:39,517
HE DIDN'T BELIEVE ME.

237
00:13:39,550 --> 00:13:42,620
HE THINKS I "WANTED" IT, RIGHT?

238
00:13:44,055 --> 00:13:44,689
I'M GOING HOME.

239
00:13:44,722 --> 00:13:45,590
PAIGE-

240
00:13:45,623 --> 00:13:48,092
YOU WERE RIGHT, I SHOULD'VE STAYED THERE.

241
00:13:48,126 --> 00:13:49,961
DEAN WINS AGAIN.

242
00:14:19,691 --> 00:14:21,225
HEY, PAIGE!

243
00:14:21,259 --> 00:14:25,330
CAN'T WAIT FOR HALF-TIME - I'M NAILING THAT FLIP.

244
00:14:26,464 --> 00:14:28,199
WHAT'S GOING ON?

245
00:14:28,232 --> 00:14:29,400
UM - EARLIER.

246
00:14:30,601 --> 00:14:32,603
I SAW YOU AND DEAN TALKING OUTSIDE...

247
00:14:32,637 --> 00:14:34,605
HE STARTED TALKING TO ME.

248
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:36,641
NO PROBLEM, JUST UH-

249
00:14:36,674 --> 00:14:39,544
JUST DON'T BE ALONE WITH HIM, OKAY?

250
00:14:39,577 --> 00:14:42,447
SOMEONE WARNED ME ABOUT HIM ONCE AND I SHOULD'VE LISTENED.

251
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:43,614
HE SEEMS NICE -

252
00:14:43,648 --> 00:14:45,049
HE IS NICE.

253
00:14:45,616 --> 00:14:46,384
MANNY, WHAT DO YOU KNOW?

254
00:14:46,417 --> 00:14:48,219
YOU TALKED TO HIM FOR FIVE MINUTES.

255
00:14:48,252 --> 00:14:49,754
I KNOW YOU GUYS HAD A DATE.

256
00:14:49,787 --> 00:14:51,622
AND I KNOW HE NEVER CALLED YOU BACK.

257
00:14:51,656 --> 00:14:54,025
AND I KNOW YOU'RE JEALOUS.

258
00:14:54,559 --> 00:14:55,560
GET OVER IT.

259
00:15:09,507 --> 00:15:10,641
WHERE'S PAIGE?

260
00:15:10,675 --> 00:15:12,477
I DON'T KNOW.

261
00:15:13,611 --> 00:15:15,346
SPOTS IS ON THE CASE.

262
00:15:22,387 --> 00:15:24,389
OH FEARLESS LEEEEEA-DER!

263
00:15:24,422 --> 00:15:25,590
GO AWAY.

264
00:15:26,424 --> 00:15:27,558
PAIGE, YOU SAY THAT ALL THE TIME,

265
00:15:27,592 --> 00:15:29,260
BUT WE BOTH KNOW YOU DON'T MEAN IT.

266
00:15:29,293 --> 00:15:32,230
YEAH, WELL, THIS TIME I DO.

267
00:15:32,263 --> 00:15:33,531
PAIGE, THE SQUAD NEEDS YOU -

268
00:15:33,564 --> 00:15:35,366
LEAVE ME ALONE!

269
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:38,736
IT'S JUST SOME STUPID GUY, RIGHT?

270
00:15:42,273 --> 00:15:44,308
OH, YOU MEAN DEAN?

271
00:15:44,342 --> 00:15:47,545
BARDELL'S RESIDENT SPORTS HERO AND-

272
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:51,082
AND RAPIST?

273
00:15:52,717 --> 00:15:54,419
YEAH. HE RAPED ME.

274
00:15:56,554 --> 00:15:57,455
AND NO ONE IN THE WORLD

275
00:15:57,488 --> 00:16:01,225
SEEMS TO BE ABLE TO DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT.

276
00:16:11,169 --> 00:16:11,436
JT!

277
00:16:20,711 --> 00:16:22,780
FOUL - BARDELL.

278
00:16:38,563 --> 00:16:40,765
TOO MUCH FOR YOU, MR. RAPIST?

279
00:16:46,571 --> 00:16:49,273
TIME OUT, NUMBER TWELVE, ON THE BENCH.

280
00:16:49,307 --> 00:16:50,641
GAME SUSPENSION.

281
00:16:51,409 --> 00:16:52,310
AND THE MASCOT -

282
00:16:52,343 --> 00:16:55,847
IS GOING TO THE PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE. NOW.

283
00:17:10,528 --> 00:17:12,697
PAIGE, WHAT'S GOING ON?

284
00:17:12,730 --> 00:17:13,564
NOTHING.

285
00:17:13,598 --> 00:17:16,367
JT, IN A MASCOT OUTFIT, ATTACKING DEAN?

286
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,469
THAT'S NOT NOTHING.

287
00:17:18,870 --> 00:17:19,804
PAIGE, JUST -

288
00:17:19,837 --> 00:17:21,906
SPIN, COULD YOU PLEASE -!

289
00:17:25,276 --> 00:17:27,678
SOMETHING HAPPENED TO YOU.

290
00:17:27,712 --> 00:17:30,648
I JUST GOT WHAT I ASKED FOR. RIGHT?

291
00:17:31,682 --> 00:17:35,486
HE TOOK IT TOO FAR. LIKE HAZEL SAID. RIGHT?

292
00:17:37,755 --> 00:17:39,290
DIDN'T HE?

293
00:17:44,595 --> 00:17:44,929
HEY!

294
00:17:47,498 --> 00:17:47,632
HEY!

295
00:17:48,666 --> 00:17:50,835
YOU'RE NOT GOING ANYWHERE.

296
00:17:52,770 --> 00:17:54,605
YOUR MASCOT CAME AT ME.

297
00:17:54,639 --> 00:17:56,007
YOU THINK THAT'S WHAT THIS IS?

298
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:57,408
SPINNER! STOP.

299
00:17:57,441 --> 00:17:58,409
WHAT! HE DESERVES IT.

300
00:17:58,442 --> 00:17:59,577
SPINNER PLEASE?!

301
00:18:03,381 --> 00:18:05,616
THE WATER BOY YOUR BOYFRIEND?

302
00:18:05,650 --> 00:18:08,719
I HAVE ONE THING TO SAY TO YOU, DEAN.

303
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:12,323
GET READY, BECAUSE I AM COMING AFTER YOU THIS TIME.

304
00:18:12,356 --> 00:18:15,393
NOT LIKE SPINNER OR THE MASCOT -

305
00:18:15,426 --> 00:18:15,960
FOR REAL.

306
00:18:37,915 --> 00:18:40,585
"DUET. THE PERFECT BLEND."

307
00:18:44,589 --> 00:18:47,592
SO MUCH FOR US "BEING AS ONE," HUH?

308
00:18:47,625 --> 00:18:48,659
I'M SORRY.

309
00:18:51,562 --> 00:18:53,731
EL, YOU'RE MY BEST FRIEND.

310
00:18:56,601 --> 00:18:58,035
BUT IF THAT'S NOT ENOUGH...

311
00:18:58,069 --> 00:19:00,271
IT'S REALLY HARD, MARCO.

312
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:03,040
PRETENDING TO BE SOMETHING -

313
00:19:03,074 --> 00:19:05,676
SOMETHING YOU'RE NOT. I KNOW.

314
00:19:08,546 --> 00:19:13,684
BUT DID YOU EVER THINK ABOUT HOW HARD IT WOULD BE FOR ME?

315
00:19:14,986 --> 00:19:16,921
ARE YOU STILL CONFUSED?

316
00:19:19,924 --> 00:19:20,391
NO.

317
00:19:24,996 --> 00:19:26,464
ELLIE, I'M GAY.

318
00:19:30,568 --> 00:19:32,403
AND YOU AND ME -

319
00:19:33,671 --> 00:19:36,007
WILL ALWAYS JUST BE FRIENDS.

320
00:19:50,554 --> 00:19:51,555
YOU'RE SURE?

321
00:19:53,024 --> 00:19:56,727
MOM AND I TALKED. I WANT TO PRESS CHARGES.

322
00:19:57,762 --> 00:19:58,362
GOOD.

323
00:19:59,130 --> 00:20:01,032
NOW IT'S A LEGAL MATTER.

324
00:20:01,065 --> 00:20:04,001
SO NO MORE CONVERSATIONS WITH DEAN.

325
00:20:06,003 --> 00:20:06,937
OKAY?

326
00:20:07,638 --> 00:20:08,572
FINE BY ME.

327
00:20:10,641 --> 00:20:12,710
SO - TUESDAY?

328
00:20:14,745 --> 00:20:19,350
THREE O'CLOCK SHARP. YOU CAN WRITE IT IN PEN THIS TIME.

329
00:20:23,621 --> 00:20:26,090
I WANT TO SCARE HIM, MISS SAUVE.

330
00:20:26,991 --> 00:20:31,829
SO BAD, HE WON'T EVEN THINK OF DOING THIS TO SOMEONE ELSE.

331
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:44,675
HEY, WHAT'RE YOU DOING HERE?

332
00:20:44,709 --> 00:20:46,977
SHOULDN'T YOU BE IN YOUR HAIR-NET?

333
00:20:47,011 --> 00:20:48,946
I TRADED A SHIFT

334
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:51,782
SO I COULD SPEND LUNCH WITH YOU.

335
00:20:51,816 --> 00:20:53,684
WOW. LUCKY ME.

336
00:20:58,222 --> 00:21:01,759
WE'RE NOT ALL LIKE DEAN, YOU KNOW.

337
00:21:01,792 --> 00:21:04,595
SOME OF US ARE GOOD GUYS.

338
00:21:05,663 --> 00:21:06,731
I KNOW.

339
00:21:08,966 --> 00:21:11,802
THAT'S WHY I WANTED TO ASK.

340
00:21:13,003 --> 00:21:16,707
YEAR-END DANCE - YOU GOING WITH ANYONE?

341
00:21:16,741 --> 00:21:17,007
NO.

342
00:21:18,976 --> 00:21:20,711
SO THEN - GO WITH ME.

343
00:21:21,712 --> 00:21:24,582
I OWE YOU A DATE ANYWAY, RIGHT?

344
00:21:25,649 --> 00:21:26,717
YEAH. YOU DO.
