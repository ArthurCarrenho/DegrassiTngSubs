I'M GONNA GET YOU! I'M GONNA GET YOU!

00:00:12,945 --> 00:00:14,580
TRY IT AGAIN...

00:00:14,613 --> 00:00:15,648
YOU CAN DO IT. COME ON...

4
00:00:15,681 --> 00:00:17,283

5
00:00:17,316 --> 00:00:18,584
OH, THAT'S LOTS...

COME ON. MORE BUBBLES, MORE BUBBLES. LET'S GO.

CRAIGOR...

00:00:46,245 --> 00:00:47,112
HEY DAD.

10
00:00:51,016 --> 00:00:53,118
WHAT HAPPENED TO SIX O'CLOCK?

11
00:00:53,152 --> 00:00:55,187
I KNOW, AH I'M SORRY.

12
00:00:55,221 --> 00:00:57,523
IT'S JUST - THE LIGHT OUTSIDE...

13
00:00:58,224 --> 00:01:00,226
LATE SUMMER... INCREDIBLE.

14
00:01:01,093 --> 00:01:02,261
AND I JUST AH...

15
00:01:02,294 --> 00:01:04,997
-GOT DISTRACTED AND MISSED DINNER.

16
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:07,433
YEAH, AH... DAD, I'M SORRY.

17
00:01:12,238 --> 00:01:14,673
WHEN I SAY SIX O'CLOCK,

18
00:01:14,707 --> 00:01:17,276
I DON'T CARE HOW GREAT THE LIGHT IS. YOU'RE HOME!

19
00:01:17,309 --> 00:01:19,311
DO YOU UNDERSTAND ME?

20
00:01:20,546 --> 00:01:22,248
JUST CLEAN IT UP.

21
00:01:27,453 --> 00:01:29,388
♪ Whatever it takes

22
00:01:31,123 --> 00:01:33,959
♪ I know I can make it through

23
00:01:36,629 --> 00:01:38,230
♪ If I hold out

24
00:01:40,199 --> 00:01:43,235
♪ I know I can make it through

25
00:01:48,107 --> 00:01:49,541
♪ Be the best

26
00:01:49,575 --> 00:01:52,111
♪ The best that I can be

27
00:01:53,612 --> 00:01:56,148

28
00:01:56,482 --> 00:01:58,484

♪ I know I can make it through

31
00:02:13,265 --> 00:02:15,234
MAN, GRADE EIGHT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE OURS.

32
00:02:15,267 --> 00:02:16,368
THIS IS SO UNFAIR.

33
00:02:16,402 --> 00:02:18,704
I HAVE NO PROBLEM WITH AN EXPANDED DEGRASSI.

34
00:02:18,737 --> 00:02:21,206
WAY MORE FISH IN THE SEA.

35
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:23,676
WHAT - YOU'RE FISHING FOR A NEW BABYSITTER?

36
00:02:23,709 --> 00:02:25,010
DUDE. OLDER WOMEN.

37
00:02:25,044 --> 00:02:26,545
HOT, SEXY, OLDER WOMEN.

38
00:02:26,578 --> 00:02:29,415
JUST WAITING TO MAKE ME INTO A MAN, OKAY?

39
00:02:29,448 --> 00:02:31,984
THIS YEAR, TOBY. JUST TRUST ME. I KNOW IT.

40
00:02:32,818 --> 00:02:34,253
THANKS FOR THE LIFT.

41
00:02:34,286 --> 00:02:36,088
OKAY. DO YOU NEED A LIFT TONIGHT?

42
00:02:36,121 --> 00:02:39,191
NO, NO, I CAN AH - MAKE IT HOME.

43
00:02:39,224 --> 00:02:40,392
I'LL BE ON TIME TONIGHT, OKAY?

44
00:02:40,426 --> 00:02:41,460
GOOD.

45
00:02:41,493 --> 00:02:42,561
GOOD LUCK TODAY, SPORT.

46
00:02:49,068 --> 00:02:51,103
IS THAT THE SOUND OF YOUR HEART POUNDING?

47
00:02:51,136 --> 00:02:53,138
NO WAIT - IT'S MINE.

48
00:02:53,172 --> 00:02:56,308
PROOF THAT SUMMER IS SO OVERRATED.

49
00:02:58,844 --> 00:03:02,314
BACK AT THIS DUMP FOR FOUR MORE YEARS.

50
00:03:02,348 --> 00:03:04,450
FOUR LONG YEARS.

51
00:03:04,483 --> 00:03:09,154
LOOK AT THIS PLACE. IT'S A ZOO IN HERE.

52
00:03:09,188 --> 00:03:11,156
OH, LOOK, THERE'S ONE OF THE MONKEYS NOW.

53
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:14,226
GOOD MORNING, STUDENTS AND WELCOME TO DEGRASSI.

54
00:03:14,259 --> 00:03:15,427
IF YOU'RE A NEW STUDENT

55
00:03:15,461 --> 00:03:17,529
AND HAVEN'T RECEIVED YOUR NEW HOME ROOM NUMBER YET,

56
00:03:17,563 --> 00:03:20,399
PLEASE SEE MRS. SMITH IN THE MAIN OFFICE IMMEDIATELY.

57
00:03:20,432 --> 00:03:23,068
IS DEGRASSI A HIGH SCHOOL AND A BLIND SCHOOL THIS YEAR?

58
00:03:23,102 --> 00:03:24,236
SORRY, MAN. I'M LOST.

59
00:03:24,269 --> 00:03:25,104
BUY A MAP.

60
00:03:26,338 --> 00:03:27,706
ALREADY GOT ONE.

61
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:29,541
NOT BLIND - JUST AH -

62
00:03:29,575 --> 00:03:31,410
HEY BOYS. WHO'S THE NEW GUY?

63
00:03:31,443 --> 00:03:33,612
-DIRECTIONALLY CHALLENGED.

64
00:03:34,179 --> 00:03:36,482
HEY CUTEY...

65
00:03:36,515 --> 00:03:37,249
M.I. LAB?

66
00:03:38,283 --> 00:03:40,352
HERE. I'LL - I'LL SHOW YOU.

67
00:03:48,594 --> 00:03:49,695
CLOSING DOWN THE HIGH SCHOOL

68
00:03:49,728 --> 00:03:52,297
WAS A LAST-MINUTE BOARD DECISION.

69
00:03:52,331 --> 00:03:54,366
MEANING WE ARE NOT FULLY PREPARED

70
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,668
FOR THE INFLUX OF STUDENTS.

71
00:03:57,736 --> 00:03:59,571
WILL THERE BE A SEPARATE STUDENT COUNCIL?

72
00:03:59,605 --> 00:04:01,173
SEPARATE VIDEO ANNOUNCEMENTS?

73
00:04:01,206 --> 00:04:02,174
WHAT ABOUT THE GRAPEVINE?

74
00:04:02,207 --> 00:04:04,309
OKAY, ONE QUESTION AT A TIME.

75
00:04:04,343 --> 00:04:05,711
IN THE SHORT-TERM,

76
00:04:05,744 --> 00:04:08,347
DEGRASSI'S GOING TO BE A VERY CROWDED PLACE.

77
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:11,150
SMALL PRICE TO PAY.

78
00:04:11,183 --> 00:04:14,286
OLDER WOMEN, YOUNGER MEN, VERY HOT.

79
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:16,321
OLDER WOMAN, JT YORKE - VERY NOT.

80
00:04:19,925 --> 00:04:20,726
TAKE A SEAT...

81
00:04:23,162 --> 00:04:26,565
YOU MAY EVEN HAVE TO SHARE LOCKERS.

82
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:29,701
SEE ME AFTER CLASS.

83
00:04:30,502 --> 00:04:31,570
WE'RE GOING TO BE COVERING

84
00:04:31,603 --> 00:04:34,273
"PONTY POOL CHANGES EVERYTHING" BY TONY BURGESS...

85
00:04:34,306 --> 00:04:36,775
ADDING GRADES 9 TO 12 IS A GREAT OPPORTUNITY FOR DEGRASSI.

86
00:04:36,809 --> 00:04:38,210
AND FOR YOU GUYS.

87
00:04:39,244 --> 00:04:41,747
I TAUGHT YOU M.I. FOR THE PAST TWO YEARS,

88
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:44,116
YOU GET ME FOR ANOTHER FOUR.

89
00:04:46,351 --> 00:04:48,654
LATE NIGHT LAST NIGHT, HUH CRAIG?

90
00:04:48,687 --> 00:04:50,322
UH - VERY AH - VERY LATE NIGHT, SIR.

91
00:04:50,355 --> 00:04:54,460

YEAH, WELL SAVE THE ZZZ'S FOR HOME, OKAY?

94
00:05:00,732 --> 00:05:03,268
DON'T FORGET TO PICK UP YOUR TEXTBOOKS IN THE GYM.

95
00:05:03,302 --> 00:05:06,205
AND EVEN THOUGH TODAY'S A HALF DAY - TOMORROW IS NOT.

96
00:05:06,238 --> 00:05:08,507
OKAY, AND EVERY SECOND WEEK, WE'LL TAKE OUT LUNCHES,

97
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:09,541
OLD SCHOOL STUFF -

98
00:05:09,575 --> 00:05:10,709
WHATEVER YOU SAY, ROOMIE.

99
00:05:10,742 --> 00:05:13,212
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU GUYS VOLUNTEERED TO SHARE.

100
00:05:13,245 --> 00:05:15,647
AW, IT'S JUST OUR WAY OF GIVING SOMETHING BACK TO DEGRASSI, THAT'S ALL.

101
00:05:15,681 --> 00:05:17,616
YEAH OR OF DESTROYING YOUR FRIENDSHIP.

102
00:05:17,649 --> 00:05:18,817
SLOW DOWN.

103
00:05:18,851 --> 00:05:19,751
HOW SOON TILL WE TELL THEM WE TOLD THEM SO...?

104
00:05:19,785 --> 00:05:21,553
NOW I GET THE TOP SHELF, ALL RIGHT?

105
00:05:21,587 --> 00:05:22,654
WHY? WE SAID I GOT IT.

106
00:05:22,688 --> 00:05:24,389
NO, I GET THE TOP SHELF BECAUSE I'M TALLER.

107
00:05:24,423 --> 00:05:25,891
YEAH, BY LIKE A MILLIMETER.

108
00:05:25,924 --> 00:05:28,927
NO, CHECK THIS OUT. READY? LOOK. SEE? WAY TALLER.

109
00:05:28,961 --> 00:05:30,562
PAIGE, YOUR HAIR IS FINE.

110
00:05:30,596 --> 00:05:31,563
FINE? I HAVE A MULLET.

111
00:05:31,597 --> 00:05:32,931
WHAT'S A MULLET?

112
00:05:32,965 --> 00:05:34,132
THAT.

113
00:05:34,166 --> 00:05:36,435
HAIRSTYLE OF THE TRAILER DWELLERS AND FASHION-IMPAIRED.

114
00:05:36,468 --> 00:05:37,569
SO GET IT FIXED.

115
00:05:37,603 --> 00:05:39,204
YEAH, BUT THAT'LL TAKE ABOUT EIGHTY BUCKS.

116
00:05:39,238 --> 00:05:40,939
I HAVE FIFTY PUT AWAY BUT MY EVIL PARENTS

117
00:05:40,973 --> 00:05:43,909

118
00:05:43,942 --> 00:05:45,611
HELLO? CHILD LABOUR?

119
00:05:45,644 --> 00:05:48,881
YOU KNOW, THERE ARE LAWS AGAINST CHILD LABOUR.

120
00:05:48,914 --> 00:05:51,416
OKAY THANKS, MR. NEWS AT 5.

121
00:05:51,450 --> 00:05:52,818

ANYWAY, ABOUT MY HAIR.

127
00:06:05,998 --> 00:06:07,266
GIVE THEM TIME.

128
00:06:07,299 --> 00:06:09,268
I'M SURE THEY'LL, YOU KNOW...

129
00:06:09,301 --> 00:06:11,770
WHAT? FORGIVE AND FORGET? RIGHT.

00:06:36,361 --> 00:06:37,729
YOU'VE BEEN GONE FOREVER!

132
00:06:37,763 --> 00:06:41,567
I KNOW. BUT - SUMMER'S OVER, I'M BACK FROM CAMP

133
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:44,036

00:06:52,377 --> 00:06:53,879
LET ME TAKE YOURS!

138
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:57,382
WHO ME? I'LL BREAK THE CAMERA.

00:07:00,052 --> 00:07:01,320
REMEMBER HOW TO USE IT?

140
00:07:01,353 --> 00:07:01,687
YEP.

141
00:07:02,521 --> 00:07:04,456
ONE HAND THERE.

142
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:16,768
DADDY AND ME ARE GONNA VISIT MOMMY.

143
00:07:16,802 --> 00:07:17,736
WANNA COME?

144
00:07:20,439 --> 00:07:23,442
JUST AH - TELL HER I MISS HER, OKAY?

145
00:07:25,043 --> 00:07:28,513
HEY, YOU CAN'T TELL YOUR DAD ABOUT US MEETING, ALL RIGHT?

146
00:07:28,547 --> 00:07:30,816
I PROMISE. ALWAYS, ALWAYS.

147
00:07:30,849 --> 00:07:32,784
ANGELA?

148
00:07:35,387 --> 00:07:37,022

00:07:40,025 --> 00:07:41,960
ANGELA, HONEY. WHO WAS THAT?

150
00:07:41,994 --> 00:07:43,328

OKAY. YOU WANT AN OLDER WOMAN?

154
00:07:53,071 --> 00:07:56,775
THE SYSTEM WILL DETERMINE YOUR BEST MATCH.

156
00:08:01,079 --> 00:08:04,850

00:08:04,883 --> 00:08:06,718
BUT AH - GO HOME ALREADY.

158
00:08:06,752 --> 00:08:08,487
CAN WE JUST FINISH THIS FIRST?

159
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:10,455
FIVE MINUTES.

160
00:08:11,723 --> 00:08:12,958
TERRI'S - NOT REALLY MY TYPE.

161
00:08:12,991 --> 00:08:15,127
SHE'S OLDER, PRETTY AND BREATHING.

162
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:17,062
EXACTLY YOUR TYPE.

163
00:08:17,095 --> 00:08:19,898
NO. I NEED MORE OF A CHALLENGE.

164
00:08:19,931 --> 00:08:20,999
SOMEONE LIKE...

165
00:08:24,970 --> 00:08:25,804
OH, LORDY.

166
00:08:27,806 --> 00:08:32,110
BUT YOU ONLY HAVE A 0.03% CHANCE OF SCORING WITH-

167
00:08:32,144 --> 00:08:34,746
PAIGE MICHALCHUK. COME TO PAPA.

168
00:08:37,983 --> 00:08:40,085
THAT'S A LOT OF YELLOW, ANGE.

169
00:08:40,118 --> 00:08:42,621
BUT THAT WAS MOMMY'S FAVOURITE COLOUR. REMEMBER?

170
00:08:42,654 --> 00:08:44,056
YES, I DO.

171
00:08:46,958 --> 00:08:49,127
DO YOU THINK SHE MISSES US?

172
00:08:49,161 --> 00:08:51,029
OH, I KNOW SHE DOES.

173
00:08:51,063 --> 00:08:53,398
JUST AS MUCH AS WE MISS HER.

174
00:08:53,432 --> 00:08:55,634
BUT DO YOU THINK SHE LIKES IT UP IN HEAVEN?

175
00:08:55,667 --> 00:08:57,069
CRAIG SAID THAT -

176
00:08:58,003 --> 00:08:59,938

177
00:09:00,505 --> 00:09:02,607
HONEY, DID YOU SEE CRAIG?

00:09:02,641 --> 00:09:04,643

00:09:04,976 --> 00:09:07,979
COME ON, SWEETIE. TELL ME THE TRUTH...

HEY SPORT, ARE YOU READY TO EAT?

184
00:10:11,977 --> 00:10:12,477
CRAIG!

185
00:10:14,246 --> 00:10:15,113
AH YEAH.

186
00:10:17,149 --> 00:10:19,084
AH - I'M JUST COMING!

187
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:32,564
WOW, ROAST BEEF, MASHED POTATOES, YORKSHIRE PUDDING.

00:10:33,899 --> 00:10:37,102
YEAH, TOTALLY. I LOVE ROAST BEEF.

190
00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:40,539
REMEMBER - REMEMBER HOW MOM USED TO MAKE -

191
00:10:47,712 --> 00:10:50,282
SO, HOW WAS THE FIRST DAY? MAKE ANY FRIENDS?

192
00:10:50,315 --> 00:10:53,852
YEAH. ONE GUY - SEAN. HE'S COOL.

193
00:10:54,219 --> 00:10:55,854
THAT'S GREAT.

194
00:10:55,887 --> 00:10:58,890
LISTEN, THERE WAS A MESSAGE ON THE MACHINE TODAY.

195
00:10:58,924 --> 00:11:00,258
FOR ME?

196
00:11:00,292 --> 00:11:01,793
NO. FOR ME.

197
00:11:01,827 --> 00:11:03,562
FROM JOEY JEREMIAH... ANY THOUGHTS?

198
00:11:03,595 --> 00:11:06,131
ANY IDEA WHY HE MIGHT BE CALLING?

199
00:11:08,166 --> 00:11:10,068
YOU DIDN'T CALL HIM?

200
00:11:10,101 --> 00:11:14,105
DAD, COME ON. WHY WOULD I CALL JOEY?

201
00:11:14,139 --> 00:11:15,874
WHY WOULD YOUR MOTHER LEAVE A SURGEON

202
00:11:15,907 --> 00:11:17,075
FOR A USED CAR SALESMAN, CRAIG?

203
00:11:17,108 --> 00:11:21,780
I MEAN THE MYSTERIES OF THE UNIVERSE ARE INFINITE TO ME.

204
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:26,084
WELL, I DIDN'T - I DIDN'T CALL. PROMISE.

205
00:11:28,153 --> 00:11:31,156
I'M NOT AH - I'M NOT LIKE MOM, OKAY?

206
00:11:36,761 --> 00:11:37,062
SO AH...

207
00:11:38,296 --> 00:11:40,832
ARE YOU GONNA CALL HIM BACK?

208
00:11:41,366 --> 00:11:43,635
NOW, WHY WOULD I DO THAT?

209
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:50,709
OKAY, MY DESTINY IS APPROACHING.

210
00:11:50,742 --> 00:11:52,878
PROJECT PAIGE HAS OFFICIALLY BEGUN.

211
00:11:52,911 --> 00:11:54,746
YEAH. IT'LL BE OVER IN ABOUT TWO MINUTES.

212
00:11:56,815 --> 00:11:58,283
OH LOOK IT'S GROSS AND GROSS-ER.

213
00:11:58,316 --> 00:12:00,285
LOOKS LIKE GROSS-ER WANTS A WORD WITH YOU.

214
00:12:00,318 --> 00:12:03,355
AH PAIGE, MAY I SAY, YOU'RE LOOKING RATHER RADIANT TODAY?

215
00:12:03,388 --> 00:12:04,789
MAY I CARRY YOUR BAG FOR YOU?

216
00:12:04,823 --> 00:12:07,726
AH, YOU WANT TO CARRY MY BAG.

217
00:12:07,759 --> 00:12:09,761
YEAH. I'LL CARRY IT HOME, I'LL CARRY IT TO SCHOOL.

218
00:12:09,794 --> 00:12:11,796
YOUR WISH IS MY COMMAND.

219
00:12:13,665 --> 00:12:15,100
OH, WELL, IN THAT CASE

220
00:12:15,133 --> 00:12:18,770
I WISH THAT - YOU'D GO BACK TO YOUR GIRLFRIEND OVER THERE,

221
00:12:18,803 --> 00:12:20,805
AND LEAVE ME ALONE. NOW.

222
00:12:25,777 --> 00:12:29,114
WOW! YOU - YOU'RE AN INSPIRATION.

223
00:12:30,348 --> 00:12:33,285
THE BATTLE HAS JUST BEGUN.

224
00:12:33,318 --> 00:12:34,853
PAIGE MICHALCHUK WILL BE MINE!

225
00:12:34,886 --> 00:12:35,887
OKAY.

226
00:12:38,323 --> 00:12:40,725
AND I GUESS I BELIEVE THAT WITH A POSITIVE ATTITUDE

227
00:12:40,759 --> 00:12:44,696
AND A DRIVE TO SUCCEED WE CAN PRETTY WELL ACHIEVE ANYTHING.

228
00:12:44,729 --> 00:12:49,000
AT LEAST THAT IS WHAT I TELL MY SELF I FACE A CHALLENGE.

229
00:12:49,034 --> 00:12:50,101
SO THAT'S ME.

230
00:12:50,735 --> 00:12:52,771
VERY ILLUMINATING, ASHLEY.

231
00:12:52,804 --> 00:12:54,005
OKAY, WHO'S NEXT?

232
00:12:55,073 --> 00:12:56,241
CRAIG MANNING?

233
00:13:05,784 --> 00:13:08,286
I AM CRAIG MANNING. THANK YOU.

234
00:13:09,287 --> 00:13:10,922
CRAIG, WE KNOW YOUR NAME.

235
00:13:10,956 --> 00:13:13,758
NOW, WE WANT TO KNOW ABOUT YOU.

236
00:13:14,993 --> 00:13:16,161
RIGHT.

237
00:13:17,729 --> 00:13:20,065
ME. IN AN INFINITE UNIVERSE.

238
00:13:23,868 --> 00:13:25,870
AN INSIGNIFICANT PLANET.

239
00:13:26,838 --> 00:13:27,739
WHAT ARE WE?

240
00:13:27,772 --> 00:13:31,376
ONE OF SIX BILLION INHABITANTS. BIG DEAL.

241
00:13:32,477 --> 00:13:33,745
AND HONESTLY?

242
00:13:34,713 --> 00:13:37,749
IF I WERE TO, SAY, IF I WERE TO DISAPPEAR?

243
00:13:38,483 --> 00:13:39,417
WHO'D CARE?

244
00:13:40,719 --> 00:13:42,253
WHAT WOULD IT MATTER?

245
00:13:42,921 --> 00:13:47,325
A SUB-ATOMIC BLIP IN THE TEMPORAL FABRIC OF CREATION.

246
00:13:50,295 --> 00:13:52,797
SO THERE YOU HAVE IT. CRAIG MANNING.

247
00:13:52,831 --> 00:13:55,233
VERY EXISTENTIAL, CRAIG.

248
00:13:57,869 --> 00:14:00,672
OKAY, HEATHER SINCLAIR. COME ON DOWN.

249
00:14:05,076 --> 00:14:06,845
SO HE'S IN GRADE NINE?

250
00:14:06,878 --> 00:14:09,848
YEAH I SAW HIM COMING OUT OF SIMPSON'S HOMEROOM THIS MORNING

251
00:14:09,881 --> 00:14:11,116
WHY DO THE NINERS GET ALL THE HOTTIES?

252
00:14:11,149 --> 00:14:14,319
WHAT DO YOU MEAN? WE HAVE JT AND TOBY.

253
00:14:15,887 --> 00:14:18,323
UGH... SHHH- THERE HE IS.

254
00:14:18,356 --> 00:14:18,857
WHERE?

255
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:30,001
EMMA NELSON, RIGHT?

256
00:14:31,803 --> 00:14:33,204
YOU AH, YOU BABYSIT ANGELA JEREMIAH.

257
00:14:34,305 --> 00:14:35,707
I DO?

258
00:14:36,474 --> 00:14:37,876
I MEAN, I DO, BUT -

259
00:14:37,909 --> 00:14:41,179
YOU DON'T RECOGNIZE ME. FIVE YEARS AGO?

260
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:44,249
OUR MOTHERS MADE US DANCE.

261
00:14:45,116 --> 00:14:46,117
THE WEDDING!

262
00:14:48,286 --> 00:14:50,355
CRAIG IS JOEY'S STEPSON!

263
00:14:50,388 --> 00:14:52,223
ANGELA'S HALF-BROTHER!

264
00:14:53,291 --> 00:14:54,359
OH... OH, HI.

265
00:14:56,895 --> 00:15:00,065
HEY. ANYWAY AH, NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN.

266
00:15:02,867 --> 00:15:03,868
CRAIG, WAIT.

267
00:15:05,336 --> 00:15:07,172
I'M BABYSITTING ANGELA LATER.

268
00:15:07,205 --> 00:15:09,007
MY MOM'S HAVING THIS BIG PARTY

269
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:11,910
AND I WAS WONDERING IF MAYBE YOU WANT TO COME ALONG?

270
00:15:11,943 --> 00:15:14,112
I WOULDN'T WANT TO CRASH.

271
00:15:14,145 --> 00:15:15,547
NO. YOU'D BE MY GUEST.

272
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:18,783
IF YOU DO WANNA COME, MEET ME OUT FRONT AFTER SCHOOL.

273
00:15:18,817 --> 00:15:20,852
I'LL BE THERE. THANKS.

274
00:15:27,926 --> 00:15:29,794
HE'S COMING TONIGHT.

275
00:15:32,497 --> 00:15:35,100
IF THIS CAR IS A LEMON - WHICH IT IS NOT -

276
00:15:35,133 --> 00:15:38,136
I'LL GIVE YOU A REAL LEMON, AND LET YOU SQUEEZE IT IN MY EYES.

277
00:15:38,169 --> 00:15:39,304
SOUND FAIR?

278
00:15:39,337 --> 00:15:42,407
OH, LISTEN TO THE MAN. HE KNOWS CARS.

279
00:15:47,145 --> 00:15:48,980
AH, WOULD YOU EXCUSE ME FOR JUST A MINUTE?

280
00:15:49,013 --> 00:15:51,316
WHY DON'T YOU OPEN 'ER UP AND SEE HOW SHE FEELS.

281
00:15:51,349 --> 00:15:54,319
OKAY, I'LL BE WITH YOU RIGHT AWAY.

282
00:15:54,352 --> 00:15:56,254
HELLO ALBERT. YOU GOT MY MESSAGE?

283
00:15:56,287 --> 00:15:56,921
SURE DID.

284
00:15:57,522 --> 00:15:59,924
GOOD. WELL, IT'S ABOUT CRAIG.

285
00:15:59,958 --> 00:16:01,392
I KNOW THIS IS NOT REALLY MY BUSINESS BUT -

286
00:16:01,426 --> 00:16:04,295
YOU'RE GOING TO BUTT IN ANYWAY?

287
00:16:04,329 --> 00:16:07,499
I'M JUST WANT TO KNOW HOW IS HE DOING.

288
00:16:08,266 --> 00:16:10,869
WHAT'S YOUR INTEREST IN MY SON?

289
00:16:10,902 --> 00:16:11,402
I JUST -

290
00:16:11,436 --> 00:16:12,604
HE IS MY SON, RIGHT?

291
00:16:12,637 --> 00:16:14,606
YES. BUT HE'S ALSO ANGELA'S BROTHER.

292
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:17,509
HALF-BROTHER. WHAT'S YOUR POINT?

293
00:16:19,010 --> 00:16:20,612
ANGELA MISSES HIM, OKAY.

294
00:16:20,645 --> 00:16:22,113
AND I KNOW HE MISSES HER.

295
00:16:22,147 --> 00:16:23,548
YOU AND I NEED TO DO SOMETHING.

296
00:16:23,581 --> 00:16:25,550
OKAY. YOU AND I NEED TO DO NOTHING.

297
00:16:25,583 --> 00:16:28,520
EXCEPT STAY AWAY FROM EACH OTHER.

298
00:16:28,553 --> 00:16:30,455
YOU'RE NOT GETTING IT HERE, OKAY.

299
00:16:30,488 --> 00:16:32,490
CRAIG WANTS TO SEE ANGELA

300
00:16:32,524 --> 00:16:33,892
AND I KNOW HE HAS BEEN SEEING HER.

301
00:16:33,925 --> 00:16:35,493
I JUST FOUND OUT MYSELF.

302
00:16:35,527 --> 00:16:37,595
HE'S BEEN DOIN' IT ON HIS OWN TIME.

303
00:16:37,629 --> 00:16:40,231
YOU AND I MAY HATE EACH OTHER, BUT DO OUR KIDS HAVE TO?

304
00:16:40,265 --> 00:16:42,934
EVEN IF IT'S JUST ONCE A MONTH -

305
00:16:48,006 --> 00:16:49,541
OKAY, ACCORDING TO THE ISAACS SYSTEM,

306
00:16:49,574 --> 00:16:51,242
YOU AND PAIGE ARE NEVER GONNA HAPPEN!

307
00:16:51,276 --> 00:16:52,477
WOULD THAT BE THE SAME "SYSTEM"

308
00:16:52,510 --> 00:16:54,979
THAT STOPPED YOU FROM DOING ANYTHING ABOUT EMMA LAST YEAR?

309
00:16:55,013 --> 00:16:55,880
NEWS FLASH, TOBY.

310
00:16:55,914 --> 00:16:57,248
IT DOESN'T WORK.

311
00:17:00,351 --> 00:17:01,920
AH, PAIGE! HOLD UP.

312
00:17:01,953 --> 00:17:03,655
OKAY, I NEED A RESTRAINING ORDER.

313
00:17:03,688 --> 00:17:04,189
WHAT!?

314
00:17:06,357 --> 00:17:08,660
AH... WILL YOU GO OUT WITH ME?

315
00:17:08,693 --> 00:17:10,328
ALL I'M ASKING FOR IS ONE DATE.

316
00:17:10,361 --> 00:17:12,897
IF WE CLICK, THEN WE'LL TALK COMMITMENT.

317
00:17:12,931 --> 00:17:14,265
WHAT DO YOU SAY?

318
00:17:15,567 --> 00:17:19,437
MAN, THAT IS CLASSIC! WHAT A KNOB!

319
00:17:21,639 --> 00:17:22,574
IN TIME...

320
00:17:22,607 --> 00:17:24,442
OKAY. HAS MY REP FALLEN

321
00:17:24,475 --> 00:17:27,912
TO THE POINT WHERE A LOSER LIKE JT THINKS HE CAN ASK ME OUT

322
00:17:27,946 --> 00:17:29,314
AND GET AWAY WITH IT?!

323
00:17:29,347 --> 00:17:30,515
IT'S HILARIOUS.

324
00:17:30,548 --> 00:17:31,449
YOU SHOULD TOTALLY DO IT.

325
00:17:31,482 --> 00:17:34,652
YEAH. PAIGE AND JT ON A DATE?!

326
00:17:34,686 --> 00:17:35,486
OH YEAH.

327
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:38,456
NEVER GOING TO HAPPEN. EVER.

328
00:17:38,489 --> 00:17:39,991
EVERYONE HAS THEIR PRICE.

329
00:17:40,024 --> 00:17:41,626
LIKE, SAY, THIRTY BUCKS?

330
00:17:41,659 --> 00:17:42,827
ENOUGH TO GET YOUR HAIR DONE?

331
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:46,264
YOU HONESTLY THINK I'D GO OUT IN PUBLIC WITH IT

332
00:17:46,297 --> 00:17:48,132
FOR THIRTY BUCKS?

333
00:17:48,166 --> 00:17:49,634
A LIGHT EVENING WITH FRODO?

334
00:17:49,667 --> 00:17:51,502
OR AN ENTIRE DAY GAGGING THROUGH COBWEBS

335
00:17:51,536 --> 00:17:53,338
IN YOUR PARENTS' GARAGE.

336
00:17:53,371 --> 00:17:55,673
YEAH, YOU KNOW, IT'S ABOUT THE EARWIGS.

337
00:17:55,707 --> 00:17:57,108
SHARP PINCHERS, JUST WAITING-

338
00:17:57,141 --> 00:17:59,611
THIRTY DOLLARS? IN CASH?

339
00:18:00,511 --> 00:18:03,615
FINE. BUT THERE WILL BE CONDITIONS.

340
00:18:03,648 --> 00:18:04,916
BIG CONDITIONS.

341
00:18:11,723 --> 00:18:12,991
IS THAT A FROG?

342
00:18:13,658 --> 00:18:15,293
ARE YOU KIDDING?

343
00:18:15,326 --> 00:18:18,596
THIS IS A BIG, RAZOR-TOOTHED DINOSAUR!

344
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:22,367
WITH A TASTE FOR LITTLE GIRLS NAMED - ANGELA!

345
00:18:24,302 --> 00:18:27,038
WHAT ARE YOU GUYS DOING TO HER?

346
00:18:27,071 --> 00:18:29,507
OH, JUST FEEDING HER TO THE DINOSAURS.

347
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:32,076
OKAY, GUYS. DINNER'S SERVED.

348
00:18:37,148 --> 00:18:38,316
COME ON.

349
00:18:42,654 --> 00:18:43,354
DADDY!

350
00:18:47,625 --> 00:18:48,626
YEAH!

351
00:18:50,795 --> 00:18:53,665
HEY! WE DIDN'T EXPECT YOU.

352
00:18:53,698 --> 00:18:55,600
I MEAN, IT'S ONLY MY BIRTHDAY.

353
00:18:55,633 --> 00:18:57,735
MUCH LESS IMPORTANT THAN A BLIND DATE...

354
00:18:57,769 --> 00:18:59,537
OKAY, OKAY. MY BAD...

355
00:18:59,570 --> 00:19:01,205
SO. JEREMIAH. HOW WAS MISS NOVEMBER?

356
00:19:01,239 --> 00:19:05,343
IF SHE WAS MISS NOVEMBER, IT WAS IN 1973.

357
00:19:05,376 --> 00:19:08,079
IT WAS LIKE GOING OUT WITH MY MOTHER.

358
00:19:08,112 --> 00:19:09,547
AH, WELL, YOU KNOW, WOMEN OF A CERTAIN AGE

359
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:11,182
DO HAVE A SPECIAL APPEAL -

360
00:19:11,215 --> 00:19:12,450
YOU CAN LEAVE NOW.

361
00:19:12,483 --> 00:19:14,752
WHAT AND MISS WATCHING YOU TURN GREY?

362
00:19:14,786 --> 00:19:16,354
DON'T WORRY, HE'S COMING HOME WITH ME.

363
00:19:16,387 --> 00:19:17,455
AFTER WE EAT.

364
00:19:22,493 --> 00:19:22,994
CRAIG.

365
00:19:23,728 --> 00:19:25,630
HEY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

366
00:19:25,663 --> 00:19:26,631
I INVITED HIM.

367
00:19:26,664 --> 00:19:28,533
THAT'S OKAY, ISN'T IT?

368
00:19:28,566 --> 00:19:30,368
YEAH, YEAH. NO AH -

369
00:19:31,069 --> 00:19:33,671
CAN I TALK TO YOU FOR A SECOND?

370
00:19:38,276 --> 00:19:40,244
LISTEN, IT'S GREAT SEEING YOU AND I MEAN THAT.

371
00:19:40,278 --> 00:19:42,046
BUT YOUR DAD DOESN'T WANT YOU -

372
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:44,182
OH, HE'S, HE'S FINE WITH THIS.

373
00:19:44,215 --> 00:19:46,551
HE KNOWS YOU'RE HERE?

374
00:19:47,185 --> 00:19:48,653
LOOK, I DON'T KNOW WHY,

375
00:19:48,686 --> 00:19:51,222
BUT HE DOESN'T WANT YOU HANGING OUT WITH ME OR WITH ANGE.

376
00:19:51,255 --> 00:19:52,757
HE'S MADE THAT RADICALLY CLEAR.

377
00:19:52,790 --> 00:19:53,691
WHAT, YOU TALKED TO HIM?

378
00:19:53,725 --> 00:19:57,295
HE CAME BY THE DEALERSHIP THIS AFTERNOON.

379
00:19:57,328 --> 00:19:59,197
CRAIG, COME ON. YOUR DAD WON'T ALLOW IT.

380
00:19:59,230 --> 00:20:00,565
WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO?

381
00:20:00,598 --> 00:20:03,201
NO PROBLEM. I GET IT.

382
00:20:03,501 --> 00:20:05,436
HEY AH, MS. NELSON, THANKS FOR THE HOT DOG.

383
00:20:41,239 --> 00:20:44,742
I'M GONNA GO DOWN TO MY DARK ROOM...

384
00:21:01,626 --> 00:21:03,361
ARE YOU LOOKING FOR SOMETHING?

385
00:21:03,394 --> 00:21:04,228
WHAT ARE YOU DOING -

386
00:21:04,262 --> 00:21:05,229
ARE YOU LOOKING FOR SOMETHING?

387
00:21:05,263 --> 00:21:07,765
WHAT ARE YOU DOING? WHAT ARE YOU--

388
00:21:08,232 --> 00:21:10,301
ARE YOU LOOKING FOR SOMETHING?

389
00:21:11,803 --> 00:21:14,172
I WORK MY ASS OFF FOR YOU!

390
00:21:15,339 --> 00:21:16,841
WHAT DO I GET?!

391
00:21:16,874 --> 00:21:18,876
WHAT DO I GET IN RETURN?

392
00:21:18,910 --> 00:21:20,278
I GET RUDENESS!

393
00:21:20,311 --> 00:21:21,245
