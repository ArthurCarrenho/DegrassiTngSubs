1
00:00:01,733 --> 00:00:06,538
QUESTION 30. RAM. WHAT DOES IT STAND FOR?

2
00:00:06,939 --> 00:00:10,375
RANDOM ACCESS MEMORY.

3
00:00:10,409 --> 00:00:11,677
HMM? I'M SORRY?

4
00:00:12,211 --> 00:00:13,512
YOU ASKED A QUESTION.

5
00:00:13,545 --> 00:00:16,248
THE ANSWER IS RANDOM ACCESS MEMORY.

6
00:00:16,281 --> 00:00:18,317
RIGHT, RIGHT. I'M SORRY GUYS.

7
00:00:18,350 --> 00:00:20,719
I'M MORE THAN A LITTLE DISTRACTED TODAY!

8
00:00:20,752 --> 00:00:24,223
I CAN'T BELIEVE I'M ACTUALLY GETTING MARRIED... TOMORROW.

9
00:00:24,256 --> 00:00:26,792
OKAY, WELL, THAT'S IT. ANY FINAL QUESTIONS?

10
00:00:26,825 --> 00:00:28,193
YES.

11
00:00:28,894 --> 00:00:31,763
WHEN ARE YOU GOING TO OPEN THIS?

12
00:00:33,532 --> 00:00:34,600
GUYS...

13
00:00:35,801 --> 00:00:39,538
SPEECH, SPEECH, SPEECH, SPEECH.

14
00:00:40,772 --> 00:00:43,275
OKAY, OKAY, UH WHERE TO START.

15
00:00:43,842 --> 00:00:46,745
AHH, LOVE - EXCITING AND NEW.

16
00:00:46,778 --> 00:00:48,313
DO WE REALLY HAVE TO HEAR THIS?

17
00:00:48,347 --> 00:00:51,483
JT, SHUT UP? I'M TRYING TO LISTEN.

18
00:00:51,517 --> 00:00:52,985
AND I'M ABOUT TO THROW UP.

19
00:00:53,018 --> 00:00:54,853
SOMEBODY'S NEVER BEEN IN LOVE.

20
00:00:54,887 --> 00:00:56,588
AND YOU HAVE SEAN?

21
00:00:56,622 --> 00:00:59,958
REALLY? WITH WHO EXACTLY?

22
00:00:59,992 --> 00:01:01,927
NOT EMMA BY ANY CHANCE?

23
00:01:10,402 --> 00:01:10,936
(Screams)

24
00:01:18,877 --> 00:01:19,811
AGH! MOM!

25
00:01:20,913 --> 00:01:21,446
MOM?

26
00:01:27,786 --> 00:01:28,620
MOM?

27
00:01:30,289 --> 00:01:31,857
THERE YOU ARE! I THOUGHT YOU LEFT WITHOUT ME.

28
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:34,226
AND REMEMBER, BREATHE.

29
00:01:34,893 --> 00:01:36,595
I HAD TO GET SOMETHING FOR MY HEAD.

30
00:01:36,628 --> 00:01:37,930
YOU DON'T HAVE A COLD?

31
00:01:37,963 --> 00:01:40,299
NO, NO. JUST A HEADACHE.

32
00:01:40,332 --> 00:01:45,337
OKAY. OKAY, I'M TRYING NOT TO PANIC, JUST BEING REALISTIC.

33
00:01:45,370 --> 00:01:47,472
WE HAVE A LOT TO DO TODAY, BEFORE TOMORROW.

34
00:01:47,506 --> 00:01:49,274
EM, LET ME JUST GO UPSTAIRS AND TAKE THIS FIRST.

35
00:01:49,308 --> 00:01:49,942
NO.

36
00:01:55,614 --> 00:01:57,983
TAKE IT IN THE CAR. GO.

37
00:01:58,016 --> 00:01:58,951
OKAY.

38
00:02:01,987 --> 00:02:04,690
OKAY. I'LL JUST RUN IN AND OUT, OKAY?

39
00:02:04,723 --> 00:02:06,758
THEN WE'LL HIT THE ENGRAVER'S, THE CATERER'S AND HOME

40
00:02:06,792 --> 00:02:09,928
BEFORE CAITLIN ARRIVES TO PERM MY HAIR.

41
00:02:13,031 --> 00:02:14,032
AND DON'T FORGET TO TAKE YOUR HEADACHE STUFF.

42
00:02:14,066 --> 00:02:16,935
I'LL BE BACK BEFORE YOU KNOW IT.

43
00:02:26,778 --> 00:02:28,714
♪ Whatever it takes

44
00:02:30,415 --> 00:02:33,051
♪ I know I can make it through

45
00:02:35,721 --> 00:02:37,322
♪ If I hold out

00:02:39,057 --> 00:02:41,893

♪ I know I can make it through...

53
00:03:11,890 --> 00:03:13,492
TRUE LOVE DOES TOO EXIST, JT.

54
00:03:13,525 --> 00:03:14,493
YEAH, RIGHT.

55
00:03:14,526 --> 00:03:16,895
JUST BECAUSE YOUR "QUEST" FOR AN OLDER WOMAN

56
00:03:16,928 --> 00:03:19,631
HAS BEEN, LIKE, POINTLESS - IT DOESN'T MEAN IT'S NOT REAL.

57
00:03:19,665 --> 00:03:20,532
IS SHE REAL?

58
00:03:20,565 --> 00:03:22,467
HEY, I THOUGHT YOU WERE OFF TODAY, EMMA?

59
00:03:22,501 --> 00:03:26,972
I AM. I HAVE TO TURN THIS IN TO KWAN.

60
00:03:27,005 --> 00:03:30,942
MS. KWAN? ONE ESSAY. ONE ATTENDANCE SLIP.

61
00:03:33,412 --> 00:03:37,082
IF ONLY ALL STUDENTS WERE AS HARD-WORKING AS YOU, EMMA.

62
00:03:37,115 --> 00:03:40,085
SO EM, REMEMBER A CERTAIN SOMEONE YOU DATED LAST YEAR?

63
00:03:40,118 --> 00:03:40,919
SEAN.

64
00:03:40,952 --> 00:03:43,488
SEEMS HE'S STILL IN LOVE WITH YOU.

65
00:03:43,522 --> 00:03:45,891
SEAN? IN LOVE WITH ME?

66
00:03:45,924 --> 00:03:48,026
NO, SEAN AND I DATED. WE WEREN'T IN LOVE.

67
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:48,994
NOT WHAT HE SAYS.

68
00:03:49,027 --> 00:03:50,662
SO YOU HAVE TO INVITE HIM TO THE WEDDING!

69
00:03:50,696 --> 00:03:51,697
NO, I DON'T.

70
00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:55,834
SEAN AND I ARE OVER. NO MATTER WHAT YOU HEARD.

71
00:03:55,867 --> 00:03:57,569
WHAT DID YOU HEAR?

72
00:03:57,602 --> 00:03:59,971
DOESN'T MATTER, RIGHT? IT'S OVER.

73
00:04:00,005 --> 00:04:02,007
RIGHT. AND I'M LATE, SO BUTT OUT.

74
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:03,775
YOU'RE STILL STAYING OVER TONIGHT THOUGH, RIGHT?

75
00:04:03,809 --> 00:04:04,676
YEAH. I GUESS.

76
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:05,844
OKAY, BYE.

77
00:04:05,877 --> 00:04:07,879
PUT ON YOUR SHOES!

78
00:04:23,061 --> 00:04:24,496
HEY SEAN.

79
00:04:24,529 --> 00:04:25,163
HEY MANNY.

80
00:04:26,131 --> 00:04:28,433
SO... TOMORROW - BIG WEDDING.

81
00:04:28,467 --> 00:04:31,970
YEAH, GIVE MY BEST TO MS. NELSON.

82
00:04:32,003 --> 00:04:34,840
ACTUALLY - YOU CAN TELL HER.

83
00:04:37,509 --> 00:04:38,877
EMMA CAME BY EARLIER TO GET SOME BOOKS

84
00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:41,813
AND SHE SAID THIS WAS FOR YOU.

85
00:04:41,847 --> 00:04:43,181
EMMA WANTS ME AT THE WEDDING?

86
00:04:43,215 --> 00:04:46,785
YEAH. SHE, MADE ME PROMISE I'D, LIKE, GET THIS TO YOU.

87
00:04:46,818 --> 00:04:47,886
COOL. THANKS.

88
00:04:55,494 --> 00:04:56,895
THANKS MANNY.

89
00:05:09,574 --> 00:05:11,209
JT, MATH CLASS IS THAT WAY.

90
00:05:11,243 --> 00:05:13,945
YEAH, I KNOW. BUT WE HAVE A VERY IMPORTANT PIT-STOP TO MAKE

91
00:05:13,979 --> 00:05:14,813
OKAY...

92
00:05:14,846 --> 00:05:15,947
I'VE BEEN THINKING.

93
00:05:15,981 --> 00:05:17,916
THERE ARE SOME UPSIDES TO 'LOVE': EMMA GOT THE DAY OFF.

94
00:05:17,949 --> 00:05:18,583
YEAH.

95
00:05:18,617 --> 00:05:19,718
SIMPSON CANCELLED HOMEWORK.

96
00:05:19,751 --> 00:05:20,652
TRUE.

97
00:05:20,685 --> 00:05:21,887
AND STRIPPERS.

98
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:24,055
BECAUSE WHEN I THINK OF LOVE, I ALWAYS THINK OF STRIPPERS.

99
00:05:24,089 --> 00:05:26,024
MARRIAGE EQUALS STAG PARTY EQUALS STRIPPERS

100
00:05:26,057 --> 00:05:27,025
WHICH EQUALS TONIGHT.

101
00:05:27,058 --> 00:05:27,959
A STRIPPER? TONIGHT?

102
00:05:27,993 --> 00:05:31,029
JUST KEEP IT COOL. CRAIG MANNING.

103
00:05:31,963 --> 00:05:34,499
JP... AND TONY. WHAT'S UP?

104
00:05:34,533 --> 00:05:36,868
YEAH, IT'S ACTUALLY JT AND TOBY.

105
00:05:36,902 --> 00:05:38,837
UM, SO WE HEARD THAT YOUR STEP-DAD IS HOSTING

106
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:40,172
A LITTLE GET-TOGETHER TONIGHT, HUH?

107
00:05:40,205 --> 00:05:41,473
YEAH. A STAG.

108
00:05:42,741 --> 00:05:45,777
RIGHT. WE WERE JUST HOPING THAT MAYBE WE COULD UH, DROP BY.

109
00:05:45,811 --> 00:05:48,079
AND MAYBE WISH MR. SIMPSON GOOD LUCK.

110
00:05:48,113 --> 00:05:48,814
AND IF THERE'S A STRIPPER THERE,

111
00:05:48,847 --> 00:05:50,982
WE'D LOVE TO GIVE HER OUR BEST.

112
00:05:51,016 --> 00:05:52,250
NO STRIPPERS, GUYS.

113
00:05:52,284 --> 00:05:55,854
SIMPSON TOLD JOEY NOT TO GET ONE.

114
00:05:55,887 --> 00:05:59,291
WHAT? IT'S LIKE A RITE OF PASSAGE!

115
00:05:59,324 --> 00:05:59,991
IT'S SIMPSON'S LAST NIGHT OF FREEDOM.

116
00:06:00,025 --> 00:06:01,526
HE CAN'T NOT HAVE A STRIPPER!

117
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:03,628
I KNOW, I KNOW. IT'S LAME.

118
00:06:03,662 --> 00:06:05,897
IT'S UNFORGIVABLY LAME.

119
00:06:05,931 --> 00:06:09,935
SO CRAIG, YOU WANNA DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT?

120
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:17,008
LET ME DO THE TALKING, BOYS.

121
00:06:17,042 --> 00:06:19,211
TONIGHT IT'S SHOWTIME.

122
00:06:28,086 --> 00:06:29,788
SHE'S THE ONE, CRAIG.

123
00:06:29,821 --> 00:06:30,689
SHE HAS GOT TO BE THE ONE!

124
00:06:30,722 --> 00:06:31,857
DOWN, BOY.

125
00:06:31,890 --> 00:06:33,859
YEAH, TOBES, GROSS.

126
00:06:33,892 --> 00:06:36,561
BUT WE CAN GET HER, RIGHT?

127
00:06:39,965 --> 00:06:41,867
BOY SCOUTS ARE DOWN THE ROAD.

128
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:44,903
UH, WE'RE ACTUALLY HERE TO INQUIRE ABOUT MS. FANNY.

129
00:06:44,936 --> 00:06:46,004
FANCY.

130
00:06:46,037 --> 00:06:48,273
FANCY. IF SHE'S AVAILABLE TONIGHT.

131
00:06:48,306 --> 00:06:50,909
YES, FOR AN OUTSIDE ENGAGEMENT.

132
00:06:51,776 --> 00:06:54,112
FANCY DON'T DO NO SQUARE DANCING.

133
00:06:54,145 --> 00:06:55,914
COME BACK WHEN YOU'RE LEGAL.

134
00:06:55,947 --> 00:06:56,681
WAIT, NO!

135
00:07:04,356 --> 00:07:08,994
THIS IS GOING TO TAKE SOME VERY DELICATE NEGOTIATING.

136
00:07:09,027 --> 00:07:12,697
WHICH IS WHY YOU TWO ARE STAYING HERE.

137
00:07:15,767 --> 00:07:16,768
HEY JOEY!

138
00:07:16,801 --> 00:07:19,104
CRAIG. DID YOU GOT EVERYTHING I NEED FOR TONIGHT?

139
00:07:19,137 --> 00:07:21,373
ALMOST EVERYTHING. IT'S LIKE THIS.

140
00:07:21,406 --> 00:07:22,807
I'M AT THE STORE, FACED WITH A CHOICE.

141
00:07:22,841 --> 00:07:24,009
S'CUSE ME.

142
00:07:24,042 --> 00:07:25,110
YEAH. NOW DO I GET, LISTEN,

143
00:07:25,143 --> 00:07:29,714
DO I GET PLAIN BORING CHIPS, OR HOT AND SPICY NACHOS.

144
00:07:29,748 --> 00:07:31,049
AND WHAT DO YOU THINK I GOT?

145
00:07:31,082 --> 00:07:32,083
I DON'T KNOW. ICE CREAM?

146
00:07:32,117 --> 00:07:33,919
I GOT HOT AND SPICY.

147
00:07:33,952 --> 00:07:34,152
GOOD.

148
00:07:35,186 --> 00:07:36,988
LIKE, SAY, TONIGHT.

149
00:07:38,757 --> 00:07:40,859
PLAIN BORING STAG EVENT,

150
00:07:40,892 --> 00:07:43,028
OR HOT AND SPICY STAG PARTY.

151
00:07:44,429 --> 00:07:46,965
ALL IT TAKES IS ONE FANCY STRIPPER.

152
00:07:46,998 --> 00:07:48,033
AH NO, NO.

153
00:07:49,401 --> 00:07:52,070
COME ON! IT'S TRADITION, JOEY.

154
00:07:52,103 --> 00:07:53,104
YEAH. I KNOW IT'S A TRADITION, CRAIG.

155
00:07:53,138 --> 00:07:54,139
YEAH! SO, HOW ABOUT IT?

156
00:07:54,172 --> 00:07:57,075
NO! IT GOES AGAINST SNAKES WISHES, ALL RIGHT?

157
00:07:57,108 --> 00:07:58,944
IT'S SEXIST, IT'S UN-PC...

158
00:07:58,977 --> 00:08:00,679
YEAH, BUT...

159
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:02,480
AND IT'S PERFECT.

160
00:08:02,514 --> 00:08:03,448
YOU KNOW WHAT? I'M GOING TO EMBARRASS THE HECK OUT OF HIM.

161
00:08:03,481 --> 00:08:05,817
FINE. BUT TECHNICALLY, THIS WAS YOUR IDEA.

162
00:08:05,850 --> 00:08:08,720
I'M NOT GETTIN' IN TROUBLE FOR IT.

163
00:08:08,753 --> 00:08:09,654
ANGIE!

164
00:08:09,688 --> 00:08:11,623
I'M GOING TO GRANDMA'S!

165
00:08:12,223 --> 00:08:15,160
YES, YOU ARE. COME ON, BABY.

166
00:08:22,934 --> 00:08:25,136
OKAY. SO YOU'RE SURE IT'LL JUST BE A BODY PERM, RIGHT?

167
00:08:25,170 --> 00:08:26,304
LIKE THIS?

168
00:08:26,338 --> 00:08:29,941
EM, I DO THIS FOR A LIVING. YES.

00:08:29,975 --> 00:08:31,910
OKAY, 20 MINUTES.

170
00:08:31,943 --> 00:08:33,945
ARE YOU OKAY IF I GO UP AND HAVE A SHOWER?

171
00:08:33,979 --> 00:08:36,181
YES. JUST GO AND RELAX.

172
00:08:58,069 --> 00:08:58,937
WEDDING CAKE.

173
00:09:00,038 --> 00:09:00,605
OKAY.

JUST SIGN HERE, PLEASE.

175
00:09:02,807 --> 00:09:03,341
NO...

176
00:09:08,146 --> 00:09:09,748
THANK YOU.

177
00:09:19,457 --> 00:09:21,993
"HAPPY BAT MITZVAH, RHODA?!"

178
00:09:30,535 --> 00:09:33,004
MOM - MAJOR EMERGENCY!

179
00:09:33,038 --> 00:09:34,139
THIS CAKE ISN'T YOURS.

180
00:09:34,172 --> 00:09:36,307
UNLESS YOU CHANGED YOUR NAME TO RHODA?

181
00:09:36,341 --> 00:09:38,843
JUST SEND IT BACK. NO BIG DEAL.

182
00:09:38,877 --> 00:09:42,180
NO BIG DEAL? THIS IS YOUR WEDDING CAKE.

183
00:09:42,213 --> 00:09:44,482
THERE'S WAY MORE IMPORTANT STUFF GOING ON, EM.

184
00:09:44,516 --> 00:09:46,418
WAY MORE IMPORTANT.

185
00:09:46,451 --> 00:09:48,286
YEAH, LIKE WHAT?

186
00:09:52,090 --> 00:09:54,025
THE TEST IS POSITIVE.

187
00:09:56,895 --> 00:09:57,962
I'M PREGNANT.

188
00:10:20,385 --> 00:10:22,120
HEY EM.

189
00:10:24,422 --> 00:10:26,024
EM, WHAT'S WRONG?

190
00:10:27,859 --> 00:10:29,260
MY MOM IS PREGNANT.

191
00:10:30,128 --> 00:10:30,261
WOW.

192
00:10:32,097 --> 00:10:33,198
HOW DID IT HAPPEN?

193
00:10:33,231 --> 00:10:36,968
I MEAN, I KNOW HOW IT HAPPENED BUT...

194
00:10:37,001 --> 00:10:38,470
DID THEY PLAN IT?

195
00:10:38,503 --> 00:10:42,073
NO. AT LEAST, I DON'T THINK SO.

196
00:10:42,107 --> 00:10:44,542
WELL, IT'S KIND OF EXCITING.

197
00:10:44,576 --> 00:10:46,311
ON SOME LEVEL.

198
00:10:46,344 --> 00:10:47,846
HOW ABOUT SOME GOOD NEWS?

199
00:10:47,879 --> 00:10:49,080
PLEASE. ANYTHING.

200
00:10:50,181 --> 00:10:52,517
GUESS WHO'S COMING TOMORROW?

201
00:10:53,418 --> 00:10:55,420
SEAN CAMERON! YOUR LOVE!

202
00:10:56,287 --> 00:10:57,822
YOU'RE NOT SMILING.

203
00:10:57,856 --> 00:10:59,924
MANNY, I TOLD YOU NO SEAN.

204
00:10:59,958 --> 00:11:01,259
I WAS TRYING TO HELP.

205
00:11:01,292 --> 00:11:06,097
BY PLAYING MATCHMAKER? GO HELP AND UN-INVITE HIM.

206
00:11:07,632 --> 00:11:10,835
OKAY, BUT - WHAT'S THAT SMELL?

207
00:11:12,003 --> 00:11:12,971
AHHH! MY PERM!

208
00:11:17,575 --> 00:11:18,109
MOM?

209
00:11:20,178 --> 00:11:21,045
MY HAIR!

210
00:11:22,046 --> 00:11:22,881
YOUR HAIR!

211
00:11:30,889 --> 00:11:31,356
MY HAIR.

212
00:11:32,323 --> 00:11:34,592
HONEY, IT'LL BE OKAY, I PROMISE.

213
00:11:34,626 --> 00:11:35,360
WHEN?

214
00:11:35,393 --> 00:11:36,427
WELL...

215
00:11:36,461 --> 00:11:37,128
WHEN?

216
00:11:37,162 --> 00:11:38,997
AFTER THE WEDDING.

217
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:41,132
I CAN'T PUT ANY MORE CHEMICALS IN YOUR HAIR RIGHT NOW -

218
00:11:41,166 --> 00:11:42,300
IT'LL FALL OUT.

219
00:11:42,333 --> 00:11:43,268
(DOOR BELL)

220
00:11:44,035 --> 00:11:45,336
I'LL GET THAT.

221
00:11:45,370 --> 00:11:48,173
I'M GONNA BE YOUR MAID OF HONOUR, LOOKING LIKE THIS?!

222
00:11:48,206 --> 00:11:49,374
IT'LL BE OKAY.

223
00:11:52,076 --> 00:11:53,945
HEY, HOW ARE YOU?

224
00:11:53,978 --> 00:11:55,180
HI. GOOD TO SEE YOU.

225
00:11:55,213 --> 00:11:56,548
I MISSED YOU!

226
00:11:56,581 --> 00:11:57,949
SO? WHAT DO YOU THINK?

227
00:11:57,982 --> 00:11:59,350
GOOD ENOUGH FOR YOUR WEDDING PARTY?

228
00:11:59,384 --> 00:12:03,188
I LOVE THEM. I JUST TOLD YOU GUYS, WEAR WHATEVER YOU WANT.

229
00:12:03,221 --> 00:12:05,990
WE ARE - IT JUST SO HAPPENS WE BOTH LOVE THE SAME DRESS.

230
00:12:06,024 --> 00:12:08,393
YEAH, WE WANTED TO DO IT. COME ON.

231
00:12:08,426 --> 00:12:10,328

232
00:12:10,361 --> 00:12:11,563
YEAH, YOUR WEDDING.

233
00:12:11,596 --> 00:12:14,065
TO SNAKE. TO ARCHIE.

234
00:12:20,305 --> 00:12:22,173
HOW ARE YOU?

235
00:12:22,207 --> 00:12:23,107
AND WHAT HAPPENED?

236
00:12:23,141 --> 00:12:26,010
SOMEBODY LEFT MY PERM SOLUTION IN TOO LONG.

237
00:12:26,044 --> 00:12:27,612
SPIKE, YOU DIDN'T!

238
00:12:27,645 --> 00:12:29,614
I THOUGHT YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO BE A PROFESSIONAL?

239
00:12:29,647 --> 00:12:31,049
I AM, BUT -

240
00:12:31,082 --> 00:12:33,084
GETTING MARRIED IS HUGE.

241
00:12:33,117 --> 00:12:35,253
WELL, THAT'S WHY WE'RE HERE TO HELP.

242
00:12:35,286 --> 00:12:37,121
THAT'S RIGHT. AND TO TAKE YOUR MIND OFF THINGS,

243
00:12:37,155 --> 00:12:39,591
WE'RE THROWING A LITTLE GIRLS NIGHT OUT LATER.

244
00:12:39,624 --> 00:12:43,194
BECAUSE IF SNAKE CAN GO OUT TONIGHT, SO CAN YOU.

245
00:12:43,228 --> 00:12:44,429
THAT'S RIGHT.

246
00:12:44,462 --> 00:12:45,396
THAT'S GREAT.

247
00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:47,966
YOU GUYS ARE SO GREAT!

248
00:12:52,103 --> 00:12:54,505
COME HERE, GIVE ME HUG!

249
00:12:55,073 --> 00:12:56,207
DOIN' SOME GOOD WORK, MAN.

250
00:12:56,241 --> 00:12:57,575
HUH?

251
00:12:57,609 --> 00:13:00,545
OH, HERE, USE THIS.

252
00:13:05,116 --> 00:13:09,187
SO I THOUGHT MAYBE WE'D UH, GET OUT OF THE CITY TOMORROW.

253
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:13,625
GO UP TO THE SPEYSIDE BACKROADS, UP NEAR ACTON.

254
00:13:20,064 --> 00:13:22,033
NELSON? AS IN EMMA NELSON?

255
00:13:22,734 --> 00:13:23,134
YEAH.

256
00:13:25,470 --> 00:13:28,473
LOOKS LIKE YOU GOT SOME BETTER PLANS.

257
00:13:28,506 --> 00:13:29,107
SEAN!

258
00:13:33,011 --> 00:13:34,312

259
00:13:34,345 --> 00:13:35,513
MANNY ARE YOU OKAY?

260
00:13:35,546 --> 00:13:36,748
I'M FINE.

261
00:13:36,781 --> 00:13:38,583
IS SOMETHING WRONG?

262
00:13:38,616 --> 00:13:39,984
YEAH. SORT OF.

263
00:13:45,156 --> 00:13:45,356
WHAT?

264
00:13:48,059 --> 00:13:51,129
OH MY GOD, YOU'VE GOT TO BE KIDDING ME.

265
00:13:56,567 --> 00:13:59,103
YOU REMEMBER THAT INVITE I GAVE YOU?

266
00:13:59,137 --> 00:14:00,972
YEAH. IT'S RIGHT HERE.

267
00:14:04,509 --> 00:14:06,577
IT WAS SORT OF A MISTAKE.

268
00:14:10,581 --> 00:14:13,418
SEAN, I'M REALLY SORRY. IT'S JUST-

269
00:14:15,086 --> 00:14:16,287
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

270
00:14:16,321 --> 00:14:17,221
I'M SORRY.

271
00:14:17,255 --> 00:14:20,658
NO, NO, NO. DON'T WORRY - IT'S NO PROBLEM.

272
00:14:36,174 --> 00:14:37,575
EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT?

273
00:14:37,608 --> 00:14:39,344
YEAH, I'M FINE, FINE.

274
00:14:40,311 --> 00:14:45,149
CAUSE MY OFFER FOR TOMORROW STILL STANDS, IF YOU WANT.

275
00:14:45,183 --> 00:14:45,383

286
00:14:59,063 --> 00:15:00,164

UH, IT'S MINE.

289
00:15:05,636 --> 00:15:07,171
YOU KNOW, MY LEASE IS UP AT THE END OF THE WEEK.

290
00:15:07,205 --> 00:15:09,140
SO I'M MOVING IN BIT BY BIT.

291
00:15:09,173 --> 00:15:11,142
DON'T YOU HAVE ENOUGH TO WORRY ABOUT RIGHT NOW?

292
00:15:11,175 --> 00:15:12,009
SNAKE WORRY? COME ON.

293
00:15:12,043 --> 00:15:14,145
HA-HA, THAT'S FUNNY, JEREMIAH.

294
00:15:14,178 --> 00:15:14,946
BETWEEN THE WEDDING AND MOVING IN,

295
00:15:14,979 --> 00:15:18,116
I'M LIKE A HEART ATTACK IN MOTION.

296
00:15:18,149 --> 00:15:20,418
I BELIEVE IT.

297
00:15:20,451 --> 00:15:22,453
OH, OH NO. DOES IT BITE?

298
00:15:23,154 --> 00:15:24,622

00:15:24,655 --> 00:15:25,656

SCOTCH, CIGARS, STRIPPERS?

304
00:15:38,903 --> 00:15:40,872
I TOLD JOEY - NO STRIPPERS. RIGHT?

305
00:15:40,905 --> 00:15:43,775
NOPE, NOPE. WE'RE GOING BOWLING.

306
00:15:44,409 --> 00:15:47,412
SNAKE, COME HERE. TALK TO ME.

307
00:15:47,445 --> 00:15:49,814
YES MASTER, SOUNDS SERIOUS...

308
00:15:49,847 --> 00:15:51,482
NO, NO. JUST WEDDING STUFF.

309
00:15:51,516 --> 00:15:52,517
HEY GUYS!

310
00:15:52,550 --> 00:15:53,818

SO, WHEN ARE YOU GUYS GOING TO HAVE A LITTLE

313
00:15:57,555 --> 00:15:59,157

DEFINITELY. AND WHO KNOWS?

318
00:16:06,831 --> 00:16:09,133
IT COULD HAPPEN SOONER THAN YOU THINK.

319
00:16:09,167 --> 00:16:10,301
I SURE HOPE NOT!

320
00:16:10,868 --> 00:16:11,636
JUST LIKE A MAN.

321
00:16:11,669 --> 00:16:13,838
NEVER WANTS TO RUSH INTO ANYTHING.

322
00:16:13,871 --> 00:16:15,606
WE'VE GOT A LOT ON OUR PLATES RIGHT NOW.

323
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:16,841
YOU KNOW, I'VE GOTTA SETTLE IN.

324

RIGHT.

326
00:16:20,311 --> 00:16:23,714
OH, I'M NOT SAYING NEVER. JUST NOT RIGHT NOW.

327
00:16:23,748 --> 00:16:27,151
HEY - YOU WANTED TO TALK WEDDING?

328
00:16:27,185 --> 00:16:29,854

00:16:47,939 --> 00:16:49,574
LOOSEN UP, IT'S YOUR STAG.

OH, GUYS.

347
00:17:06,491 --> 00:17:07,892
WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?

348
00:17:07,925 --> 00:17:11,629
WELL, I HAVEN'T CLEARED YOU WITH JOEY YET.

349
00:17:12,530 --> 00:17:13,764
LOOK GUYS, WHATEVER YOU'RE SELLING,

350
00:17:13,798 --> 00:17:17,368
WE'RE NOT INTERESTED IN, OKAY? WHAT ARE YOU SELLING, ANYWAYS?

351
00:17:17,401 --> 00:17:19,971
ACTUALLY, WE'RE UH, WE'RE HERE FOR THE SHOW.

00:17:20,004 --> 00:17:21,239
YEAH.

353
00:17:21,272 --> 00:17:23,741
FANCY WAS SORTA THEIR IDEA.

354
00:17:23,774 --> 00:17:26,344
REALLY. OH WELL, IN THAT CASE - NO.

355
00:17:26,377 --> 00:17:27,512
BUT - COME ON.

356
00:17:27,545 --> 00:17:28,646
NO. GET OUT OF HERE.

357
00:17:28,679 --> 00:17:30,915
BOTH OF YOUR AGES COMBINED WOULD NOT MAKE YOU OLD ENOUGH.

358
00:17:30,948 --> 00:17:35,319
BUT, HOW COME CRAIG GETS TO STAY AND WATCH THE SHOW?

359
00:17:35,353 --> 00:17:38,923
CRAIG GETS TO GO UPSTAIRS IN HIS BEDROOM AND WATCH TV, OKAY?

360
00:17:38,956 --> 00:17:39,724
BUT JOEY -

361
00:17:39,757 --> 00:17:41,592
NO. NO. NO. NICHT. NO.

362
00:17:47,899 --> 00:17:52,637
LOOK, CRAIG, WE'RE IN THE SAME BOAT AS YOU, SO, YOU KNOW.

363
00:18:09,954 --> 00:18:11,622
MAKE THEM STOP?

364
00:18:11,656 --> 00:18:15,660
OR YOU'LL HAVE FOUR DEAD MEXICANS ON YOUR HANDS.

365
00:18:21,299 --> 00:18:24,302
OKAY, THERE'S A PROBLEM HERE, SPIKE.

366
00:18:26,537 --> 00:18:27,471
IS IT EMMA?

367
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:32,476
HERE, HAVE THIS. IT'LL HELP.

368
00:18:32,510 --> 00:18:33,477
I CAN'T.

369
00:18:33,511 --> 00:18:34,278
WHAT DO YOU MEAN YOU CAN'T?

370
00:18:34,312 --> 00:18:35,646
THIS IS YOUR BACHELORETTE PARTY.

371
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:37,281
I JUST CAN'T, OKAY?

372
00:18:39,383 --> 00:18:40,851
YOU KNOW THAT KINDA SOUNDS TO ME

373
00:18:40,885 --> 00:18:43,020
LIKE YOU'RE PREGNANT, SPIKE.

374
00:18:48,793 --> 00:18:50,628
OKAY, YOU'RE PREGNANT.

375
00:18:52,330 --> 00:18:55,333
IT'S NOTHING TO BE ASHAMED OF.

376
00:18:55,866 --> 00:18:57,735
YEAH, I MEAN TOTALLY.

377
00:18:57,768 --> 00:19:00,338
LOOK, AT LEAST THIS TIME, YOU'VE GOT SOMEONE WHO LOVES YOU.

378
00:19:00,371 --> 00:19:01,906
YEAH. SOME WHO'S GOING TO BE THERE FOR YOU.

379
00:19:01,939 --> 00:19:03,841
A GUY WHO DOESN'T WANT KIDS.

380
00:19:03,874 --> 00:19:05,376
YOU GUYS HEARD HIM.

381
00:19:05,409 --> 00:19:06,210
YEAH, BUT...

382
00:19:06,244 --> 00:19:07,812
HE MADE WHERE HE STANDS, VERY CLEAR.

383
00:19:07,845 --> 00:19:10,781
HE DOESN'T WANT A KID RIGHT NOW.

384
00:19:11,482 --> 00:19:12,683
SO WHAT'RE YOU GONNA DO?

385
00:19:12,717 --> 00:19:15,586
I DON'T KNOW. CANCEL TOMORROW?

386
00:19:15,620 --> 00:19:17,888
I MEAN, I LOVE SNAKE, BUT -

387
00:19:18,623 --> 00:19:20,691
EM AND I HAVE GOTTEN THIS FAR ON OUR OWN.

388
00:19:20,725 --> 00:19:23,461
MAYBE THIS WASN'T MEANT TO HAPPEN.

389
00:19:23,494 --> 00:19:24,262
BUT SPIKE-

390
00:19:24,295 --> 00:19:27,698
I'M SERIOUS, CAITLIN.

391
00:19:27,732 --> 00:19:30,735
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO ABOUT THE BABY?

392
00:19:30,768 --> 00:19:33,104
THAT WASN'T MEANT TO HAPPEN EITHER.

393
00:19:33,137 --> 00:19:34,839
SO MAYBE IT WON'T.

394
00:19:39,977 --> 00:19:40,978
SO, SEAN.

395
00:19:41,012 --> 00:19:42,913
YOU'RE SURE HE WASN'T TOO UPSET WHEN YOU TOLD HIM?

396
00:19:42,947 --> 00:19:46,984
FOR THE MILLIONTH TIME, HE WASN'T UPSET.

397
00:19:47,485 --> 00:19:48,386
GOOD.

398
00:19:48,419 --> 00:19:52,523
I HOPE SNAKE WILL TAKE HIS NEWS JUST AS WELL.

399
00:19:52,556 --> 00:19:53,958
MY PARENTS HAVE, LIKE, 20 SIBLINGS.

400
00:19:53,991 --> 00:19:56,827
SO I SAY, THE MORE THE MERRIER.

401
00:19:56,861 --> 00:19:59,864
ACTUALLY? I'D LOVE TO HAVE A LITTLE BROTHER.

402
00:19:59,897 --> 00:20:01,899
OR A SISTER. I'M NOT PICKY!

403
00:20:01,932 --> 00:20:05,636
I JUST WANT US TO FEEL LIKE A FAMILY.

404
00:20:05,670 --> 00:20:08,839
AND A NEW BABY WOULD SO DO THAT.

405
00:20:09,774 --> 00:20:12,643
HEY! HOW WAS YOUR LAST NIGHT AS A SINGLE WOMAN?

406
00:20:12,677 --> 00:20:14,612
DID YOU GUYS GET ALL WILD AND CRAZY?

407
00:20:14,645 --> 00:20:16,147
IT WAS FINE.

408
00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:17,915
SO CAN I TAKE THIS OFF NOW?

409
00:20:17,948 --> 00:20:19,517
SURE.

410
00:20:19,550 --> 00:20:20,818
HERE.

411
00:20:26,791 --> 00:20:27,992
HOW DOES IT LOOK?

412
00:20:29,794 --> 00:20:31,729
I'VE RUINED EVERYTHING.

413
00:20:32,830 --> 00:20:33,130
SPIKE!

414
00:20:34,565 --> 00:20:37,401
I WOULDN'T - SHE PRETTY UPSET.

415
00:20:37,435 --> 00:20:37,935
STILL?

416
00:20:38,869 --> 00:20:39,804
WHY DON'T YOU STAY DOWN HERE,

417
00:20:39,837 --> 00:20:42,106
AND WE'LL TRY AND IRON IT OUT.

418
00:20:42,139 --> 00:20:44,141
I'LL JUST BE ONE MINUTE.

419
00:20:45,109 --> 00:20:48,079
OKAY, I KNOW WHAT YOU FOUND OUT IS BEYOND WEIRD

420
00:20:48,112 --> 00:20:51,649
BUT IT'S NOT THE END OF THE WORLD.

421
00:20:53,184 --> 00:20:55,186
I'M FINE WITH THIS AND SNAKE WILL BE TOO.

422
00:20:55,219 --> 00:20:57,088
WE JUST HAVE TO CONVINCE HIM THAT.

423
00:20:57,121 --> 00:20:59,023
CONVINCE HIM? HOW?

424
00:20:59,056 --> 00:21:02,760
I DON'T KNOW. HOWEVER YOU CONVINCED ME ABOUT YOU TOO.

425
00:21:02,793 --> 00:21:04,862
IF I EVEN HAVE THIS BABY.

426
00:21:07,098 --> 00:21:07,698
WHAT?

427
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:11,202
WE DON'T WANT ANYMORE KIDS RIGHT NOW.

428
00:21:11,235 --> 00:21:12,503
END OF STORY.

429
00:21:14,638 --> 00:21:16,173
END OF STORY FOR WHO?

430
00:21:22,847 --> 00:21:26,150
YOU'RE NOT THINKING OF HAVING AN ABORTION.

431
00:21:27,151 --> 00:21:28,085
I MIGHT.
