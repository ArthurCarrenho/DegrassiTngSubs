1
00:00:01,400 --> 00:00:04,637
MS. NELSON. HOW DO YOU PROPOSE WE GET GENETICALLY MODIFIED FOODS

2
00:00:04,670 --> 00:00:05,938
OUT OF THE CAF?

3
00:00:06,705 --> 00:00:08,073
WELL, MR. RADITCH, WE CAN START

4
00:00:08,107 --> 00:00:10,843
BY LOOKING AT ORGANIC FOOD SUPPLIERS.

5
00:00:10,876 --> 00:00:12,678
ORGANIC FOOD IN THE CAFETERIA?

6
00:00:12,711 --> 00:00:14,980
WHAT'S NEXT - FRESH MOUNTAIN SPRING WATER

7
00:00:15,014 --> 00:00:16,081
IN THE WATER FOUNTAINS?

8
00:00:16,115 --> 00:00:17,249
ARCHIE, BE SERIOUS.

9
00:00:17,283 --> 00:00:18,651
I'M SORRY, EM.

10
00:00:19,785 --> 00:00:22,121
BUT HOW MANY TIMES ARE WE GOING TO DO THIS MOCK DEBATE?

11
00:00:22,154 --> 00:00:23,823
UNTIL I'M READY FOR THE BIG MEETING.

12
00:00:23,856 --> 00:00:24,957
SECOND PERIOD TOMORROW!

13
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:25,658
YOU'RE MORE THAN READY FOR RADITCH.

14
00:00:25,691 --> 00:00:28,694
YOU'RE READY TO TAKE ON THE UN.

15
00:00:29,628 --> 00:00:32,164
WHOA. IT'S WAY PAST YOUR BEDTIME.

16
00:00:33,098 --> 00:00:35,067
OKAY UH, MADE YOUR LUNCH FOR TOMORROW?

17
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:36,869
DONE YOUR HOMEWORK? BRUSHED YOUR TEETH?

18
00:00:36,902 --> 00:00:38,070
ARCHIE, RELAX.

19
00:00:39,238 --> 00:00:42,908
I'M SORRY, I'M JUST NOT USED TO BEING IN CHARGE.

20
00:00:42,942 --> 00:00:44,009
YOU'RE DOING GREAT.

21
00:00:44,043 --> 00:00:47,847
AND REMEMBER, MOM WILL BE HOME IN TWO DAYS. WAIT -

22
00:00:49,748 --> 00:00:51,150
ATTENTION DEGRASSI STUDENTS. EMMA NELSON

23
00:00:51,183 --> 00:00:54,720
REPORT TO BED IMMEDIATELY OR FACE A YEAR'S DETENTION.

24
00:00:54,753 --> 00:00:58,824
BUT SIR! WHAT ABOUT MY SPOTLESS ACADEMIC RECORD!?

25
00:01:00,159 --> 00:01:02,094
♪ Whatever it takes

26
00:01:03,996 --> 00:01:06,832
♪ I know I can make it through

27
00:01:09,068 --> 00:01:10,870
♪ If I hold out

28
00:01:12,872 --> 00:01:15,708
♪ I know I can make it through

29
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:22,615
♪ Be the best

30
00:01:22,648 --> 00:01:24,984
♪ The best that I can be

31
00:01:26,118 --> 00:01:28,254
♪ Hear what I say to you

32
00:01:29,054 --> 00:01:31,056
♪ Whatever it takes

33
00:01:31,156 --> 00:01:32,958
♪ I can see it

34
00:01:32,992 --> 00:01:35,160
♪ I know I can make it

35
00:01:37,863 --> 00:01:40,699
♪ I know I can make it through

36
00:01:46,338 --> 00:01:48,340
HEY GUYS! WAIT UP.

37
00:01:49,141 --> 00:01:50,175
UH, WHAT'S THAT?

38
00:01:50,209 --> 00:01:52,144
IT'S FOR OUR PRESENTATION TO RADITCH.

39
00:01:52,177 --> 00:01:53,879
UH-OH, EMMA'S ON THE WARPATH.

40
00:01:53,913 --> 00:01:56,048
BETTER HEAD FOR THE HILLS.

41
00:01:56,081 --> 00:01:57,349
YOU GUYS SHOULD BE PROUD OF EM.

42
00:01:57,383 --> 00:02:00,719
SHE'S DEGRASSI'S VERY OWN JOAN OF ARC.

43
00:02:00,753 --> 00:02:01,987
UH - JOAN OF ARC WAS A LUNATIC

44
00:02:02,021 --> 00:02:04,323
WHO TOOK ORDERS FROM A BURNING BUSH.

45
00:02:04,356 --> 00:02:07,059
BUT JOAN WAS ALSO BRAVE AND STRONG

46
00:02:07,092 --> 00:02:09,028
AND AN INSPIRATION TO WOMEN EVERYWHERE.

47
00:02:09,061 --> 00:02:10,729
JUST LIKE OUR EMMA.

48
00:02:10,763 --> 00:02:13,098
THANKS GUYS, BUT I'M NO JOAN OF ARC.

49
00:02:13,132 --> 00:02:16,602
I'M JUST FOLLOWING MY CONSCIENCE.

50
00:02:23,142 --> 00:02:25,044
HELP NEEDED IN THE CAF?

51
00:02:25,077 --> 00:02:26,412
YOU APPLYING FOR THAT?

52
00:02:26,445 --> 00:02:29,782
I DON'T KNOW, SPINNER. WORKING IN THE CAF PROBABLY SUCKS.

53
00:02:29,815 --> 00:02:32,217
OKAY, I WORKED IN THE CAF LAST YEAR, REMEMBER.

54
00:02:32,251 --> 00:02:34,620
IT DEFINITELY SUCKS.

55
00:02:35,788 --> 00:02:37,656
WELL, SEE NOW HERE'S A GUY

56
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:41,093
WHO NEVER HAS TO WORRY ABOUT GETTING A JOB.

57
00:02:41,126 --> 00:02:43,429
WHOA. DID YOU WIN THE LOTTERY?

58
00:02:43,462 --> 00:02:45,864
NO. BUT DAD TOOK ME SHOPPING LAST NIGHT -

59
00:02:45,898 --> 00:02:48,400
A LITTLE BELATED BIRTHDAY GIFT.

60
00:02:48,434 --> 00:02:53,038
DID YOU GUYS LEAVE ANYTHING ON THE RACKS?

61
00:02:58,210 --> 00:02:59,411
WE KNOW IT'S UNREALISTIC TO EXPECT

62
00:02:59,445 --> 00:03:01,780
ALL GM FOODS OUT OF THE CAF.

63
00:03:01,814 --> 00:03:05,250
A NUMBER OF COMPANIES DO SELL NON-GENETICALLY MODIFIED FOODS.

64
00:03:05,284 --> 00:03:08,954
WE CAN ORDER AS MUCH FOOD FROM THEM AS POSSIBLE.

65
00:03:08,988 --> 00:03:11,156
AT DOUBLE AND TRIPLE THE COST.

66
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:13,025
MR. RADITCH? TRY ONE OF THESE.

67
00:03:13,058 --> 00:03:14,860
TOMATOES?

68
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:17,229
GENETICALLY MODIFIED TOMATOES.

69
00:03:17,262 --> 00:03:19,798
LIKE SHEILA USES IN THE CAF.

70
00:03:21,333 --> 00:03:23,335
IT'S PERFECTLY FINE.

71
00:03:23,369 --> 00:03:27,106
YEAH, AND YOU HARDLY EVEN TASTE THE SCORPION,

72
00:03:27,139 --> 00:03:28,107
CAN YOU?

73
00:03:29,241 --> 00:03:32,244
THEY ADD SCORPION DNA, TO MAKE THEM RESISTANT TO PESTS.

74
00:03:32,277 --> 00:03:34,747
OF COURSE - NOBODY HAS ANY IDEA WHAT EATING SCORPION DNA

75
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:35,948
WILL DO TO US.

76
00:03:36,815 --> 00:03:39,451
YOU'RE RIGHT, THAT IS DISTURBING.

77
00:03:40,386 --> 00:03:42,955
BUT IT'S ALSO SPECULATION.

78
00:03:42,988 --> 00:03:44,990
I'VE DONE SOME RESEARCH GM FOODS

79
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:47,126
AND I KNOW THEY HAVEN'T PROVEN TO BE HARMFUL.

80
00:03:47,159 --> 00:03:48,160
OR HARMLESS.

81
00:03:50,095 --> 00:03:52,731
MAKING CROPS RESISTANT TO DROUGHT AND DISEASE

82
00:03:52,765 --> 00:03:54,767
MIGHT BE WORTH THE RISK.

83
00:03:55,401 --> 00:03:56,235
THANKS FOR ALL YOUR HARD WORK

84
00:03:56,268 --> 00:03:58,404
AND FOR BRINGING THIS TO MY ATTENTION.

85
00:03:58,437 --> 00:04:02,941
BUT WITH THE CUTBACKS, WE'RE LUCKY TO EVEN HAVE A CAFETERIA.

86
00:04:02,975 --> 00:04:04,176
I'M SORRY.

87
00:04:09,148 --> 00:04:09,748
GOOD.

88
00:04:11,116 --> 00:04:15,454
OKAY, LET'S WRAP UP WITH A LITTLE FREE INTERNET RESEARCH TIME.

89
00:04:30,135 --> 00:04:32,471
YOU GOT AN MP3 PLAYER TOO?

90
00:04:32,504 --> 00:04:35,541
MAN THIS MUST HAVE COST LIKE, FIVE HUNDRED BUCKS.

91
00:04:35,574 --> 00:04:39,545
YEAH, IT'S JUST DAD GOING OVERBOARD, AS USUAL.

92
00:04:39,578 --> 00:04:43,015
IT'S LIKE THE MERCEDES BENZ OF MP3 PLAYERS.

93
00:04:43,048 --> 00:04:43,916
I GUESS.

94
00:04:45,317 --> 00:04:48,954
WHY AM I MORE EXCITED ABOUT THIS THAN YOU ARE?

95
00:04:48,987 --> 00:04:50,022
IT'S JUST AN MP3 PLAYER.

96
00:04:50,055 --> 00:04:52,458
JUST AN MP3 PLAYER?!

97
00:04:52,491 --> 00:04:55,928
MAN, SINCE KWAN BROKE MY DISCMAN LAST YEAR,

98
00:04:55,961 --> 00:04:57,796
I'M BACK TO CASSETTES.

99
00:04:58,330 --> 00:04:59,865
SUCKS TO BE YOU.

100
00:05:13,045 --> 00:05:15,013
IF YOU DON'T LIKE THE FOOD IN THE CAF,

101
00:05:15,047 --> 00:05:16,115
THEN JUST DON'T EAT IT.

102
00:05:16,148 --> 00:05:17,049
THAT'S NOT IT.

103
00:05:17,082 --> 00:05:19,384
I WANT PEOPLE TO KNOW WHAT THEY'RE EATING.

104
00:05:19,418 --> 00:05:22,054
THAT, LIKE, THE APPLES THEY SELL IN THE CAF

105
00:05:22,087 --> 00:05:24,223
MIGHT HAVE FISH DNA IN THEM.

106
00:05:25,157 --> 00:05:28,093
THE APPLES GOT FISH STUFF IN THEM?

107
00:05:28,127 --> 00:05:29,394
MAN, THAT'S MESSED UP.

108
00:05:29,428 --> 00:05:32,131
THAT'S WHAT I MEAN?

109
00:05:32,164 --> 00:05:35,067
I DON'T KNOW I DON'T USUALLY CARE ABOUT THIS KIND OF STUFF.

110
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:36,401
BUT I DON'T KNOW,

111
00:05:36,435 --> 00:05:39,138
IT SEEMS LIKE YOU GOT SOMETHING IMPORTANT TO SAY.

112
00:05:39,171 --> 00:05:40,439
I THINK I DO.

113
00:05:40,472 --> 00:05:43,208
WELL, THEN DON'T BACK DOWN.

114
00:05:44,076 --> 00:05:46,378
DON'T LET RADITCH SHUT YOU UP.

115
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:05,063
MAN, YOU GOT THOSE SHOES FOR YOUR BIRTHDAY TOO?

116
00:06:05,097 --> 00:06:07,466
I JUST WISH I HAD YOUR DAD, JIM.

117
00:06:07,499 --> 00:06:10,135
WAIT A SECOND - YOU THINK YOUR PARENTS WOULD ADOPT ME?

118
00:06:10,169 --> 00:06:11,003
AH NO.

119
00:06:11,036 --> 00:06:13,539
THEY ALREADY HAVE ANOTHER SON - SPINNER.

120
00:06:13,572 --> 00:06:15,207
THIS DUDE HAS WORN SERIOUS GROOVES IN MY COUCH.

121
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:17,442
AND I'M THINKING OF PUTTING A SIGN UP -

122
00:06:17,476 --> 00:06:21,079
SOMETHING LIKE "SPINNER LIVES HERE."

123
00:06:22,114 --> 00:06:24,316
WELL, IF YOUR PARENTS DO LOVE SPINNER SO MUCH,

124
00:06:24,349 --> 00:06:26,218
WHY DON'T THEY TAKE HIM SHOPPING?

125
00:06:26,251 --> 00:06:29,521
I'VE SEEN YOU WEAR THAT SHIRT LIKE SIX HUNDRED TIMES NOW.

126
00:06:29,555 --> 00:06:30,622
YOU HAVE NOT.

127
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:32,558
ANYWAY I LIKE THIS SHIRT.

128
00:06:32,591 --> 00:06:34,893
YEAH, YEAH I LIKE- I LIKED IT TOO.

129
00:06:34,927 --> 00:06:38,096
BACK WHEN YOU BOUGHT IT - IN GRADE SEVEN.

130
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:43,035
IS THAT SUPPOSED TO BE A JOKE?

131
00:06:43,068 --> 00:06:43,669
YEAH.

132
00:06:43,702 --> 00:06:46,071
REALLY. IT'S WASN'T FUNNY.

133
00:06:47,539 --> 00:06:48,207
OKAY...

134
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,075
WE DON'T ALL HAVE RICH PARENTS,

135
00:06:50,108 --> 00:06:52,377
WHO'LL JUST BUY US WHATEVER WE WANT.

136
00:06:52,411 --> 00:06:55,013
OOH, PA-PA, PLEASE! SPOIL ME.

137
00:06:55,714 --> 00:06:59,384
MY PARENTS ALREADY DO SPOIL YOU, FREELOADER.

138
00:07:22,674 --> 00:07:23,709
IF YOU CARE ABOUT THE FOOD YOU EAT,

139
00:07:23,742 --> 00:07:25,644
DON'T EAT AT THE CAFETERIA.

140
00:07:25,677 --> 00:07:26,578
IF YOU CARE ABOUT THE FOOD YOU EAT,

141
00:07:26,612 --> 00:07:29,181
DON'T EAT AT THE CAFETERIA.

142
00:07:29,214 --> 00:07:30,115
IF YOU CARE ABOUT THE FOOD YOU EAT,

143
00:07:30,148 --> 00:07:32,317
DON'T EAT AT THE CAFETERIA.

144
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:33,518
IF YOU CARE ABOUT THE FOOD YOU EAT,

145
00:07:33,552 --> 00:07:35,420
DON'T EAT AT THE CAFETERIA.

146
00:07:35,454 --> 00:07:36,521
IF YOU CARE ABOUT THE FOOD YOU EAT,

147
00:07:36,555 --> 00:07:38,357
DON'T EAT AT THE CAFETERIA.

148
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:41,627
"SHEILA'S TRYING TO POISON US"? C'MON.

149
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:44,196
I WOULDN'T EXPECT YOU TO BE ON THE SIDE OF GM FOODS, ELLIE.

150
00:07:44,229 --> 00:07:45,530
DIDN'T SAY THAT I WAS.

151
00:07:45,564 --> 00:07:47,499
BUT IF IT MEANS KIDS CAN AFFORD LUNCH -

152
00:07:47,532 --> 00:07:49,968
YEAH AND CANCER 20 YEARS FROM NOW?

153
00:07:50,002 --> 00:07:52,337
IF I WAS STARVING TO DEATH IN THE THIRD WORLD,

154
00:07:52,371 --> 00:07:53,672
I'D RATHER DIE OF CANCER IN THE FUTURE

155
00:07:53,705 --> 00:07:55,440
THAN NOT HAVE A FUTURE AT ALL.

156
00:07:55,474 --> 00:07:59,077
MAY I HAVE THAT, MISS NASH?

157
00:08:01,146 --> 00:08:03,582
I'M JUST TRYING TO INFORM PEOPLE --

158
00:08:03,615 --> 00:08:04,816
SCHOOL GROUNDS ARE MY JURISDICTION.

159
00:08:04,850 --> 00:08:10,088
I MAKE THE RULES AND SPREADING PROPAGANDA IS UNACCEPTABLE.

160
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:17,162
HI JANE, COME ON IN.

161
00:08:17,195 --> 00:08:18,263
FRANKLIN, TOBY...

162
00:08:21,733 --> 00:08:24,169
SO, HE JUST TOOK THEM AWAY?

163
00:08:24,202 --> 00:08:26,405
AFTER HE WENT "BLAH BLAH BLAH,

164
00:08:26,438 --> 00:08:30,175
JURISDICTION, PROPAGANDA, BLAH BLAH BLAH."

165
00:08:30,208 --> 00:08:31,677
SO, WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO NOW?

166
00:08:31,710 --> 00:08:35,480
I DON'T KNOW. I GUESS I'LL JUST GIVE UP - HE WINS.

167
00:08:35,514 --> 00:08:38,016
AT LEAST I GOT SOME KIDS THINKING ABOUT IT, RIGHT?

168
00:08:38,050 --> 00:08:38,250
YEAH.

169
00:08:39,084 --> 00:08:40,352
CLASS? SETTLE DOWN.

170
00:08:40,385 --> 00:08:45,190
TIME FOR THE MORNING ANNOUNCEMENTS.

171
00:08:45,223 --> 00:08:47,159
FIRST UP? A VERY SPECIAL ANNOUNCEMENT -

172
00:08:47,192 --> 00:08:49,094
LIVE FROM THE CAFETERIA.

173
00:08:49,127 --> 00:08:51,063
TAKE IT AWAY, SHEILA!

174
00:08:51,096 --> 00:08:52,230
GOOD MORNING ONE AND ALL.

175
00:08:52,264 --> 00:08:55,100
AND WELCOME TO THE DEGRASSI CAFETERIA,

176
00:08:55,133 --> 00:08:58,070
PURVEYORS OF FINE FOODS SINCE 1999.

177
00:08:59,438 --> 00:09:00,772
SOME PEOPLE HAVE BEEN QUESTIONING

178
00:09:00,806 --> 00:09:03,408
THE QUALITY OF MY FOOD OF LATE.

179
00:09:03,442 --> 00:09:05,577
REALLY, SHEILA? BUT WHY?

180
00:09:05,610 --> 00:09:07,412
I JUST DON'T KNOW.

181
00:09:07,446 --> 00:09:11,049
FOR I USE ONLY THE FINEST OF INGREDIENTS.

182
00:09:11,083 --> 00:09:13,585
AND JUST LOOK AT WHAT I HAVE TO OFFER.

183
00:09:13,618 --> 00:09:17,122
WE HAVE HOT LUNCH SPECIALS EVERY DAY

184
00:09:18,156 --> 00:09:19,691
FOR JUST $3.99.

185
00:09:22,094 --> 00:09:24,830
AND SHEILA SAUCE, IS ALWAYS FREE.

186
00:09:24,863 --> 00:09:29,134
FOR AT MY CAFETERIA, KIDS COME FIRST!

187
00:09:29,167 --> 00:09:31,236
DON'T YOU DESERVE THE BEST?

188
00:09:31,269 --> 00:09:34,706
RADITCH ACCUSED ME OF SPREADING PROPAGANDA?

189
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:36,108
WHAT WAS THAT?

190
00:09:37,476 --> 00:09:41,246
YOU KNOW WHAT I JUST SAID ABOUT GIVING UP?

191
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:42,080
I LIED.

192
00:09:49,488 --> 00:09:52,124
JT, CAN I HAVE YOUR AUTOGRAPH?

193
00:09:52,157 --> 00:09:54,259
TOBY, YOUR JEALOUSY BORES ME.

194
00:09:54,292 --> 00:09:56,862
JT, WHAT WERE YOU THINKING?

195
00:09:56,895 --> 00:09:58,830
AND TOBY - WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

196
00:09:58,864 --> 00:10:00,232
IS THAT A TRICK QUESTION?

197
00:10:00,265 --> 00:10:02,567
YOU'RE ACTUALLY BUYING THIS TOXIC JUNK?

198
00:10:02,601 --> 00:10:04,436
HEY, WATCH IT. THAT'S SLANDER!

199
00:10:04,469 --> 00:10:07,139
WELL SO WAS YOUR COMMERCIAL!

200
00:10:07,172 --> 00:10:08,640
LOOK AT THESE FRIES.

201
00:10:09,508 --> 00:10:11,643
THE POTATOES WERE PROBABLY CREATED IN SOME LABORATORY.

202
00:10:11,676 --> 00:10:14,212
GIVE ME BACK MY LUNCH!

203
00:10:19,785 --> 00:10:21,720
YOU BETTER GET RUNNIN'.

204
00:10:27,826 --> 00:10:31,830
OKAY, SOMEONE IS NOT MAKING IT OUT OF HERE ALIVE.

205
00:10:37,803 --> 00:10:39,137
NO, NO, NO!

206
00:10:45,377 --> 00:10:46,778
FOOD FIGHT!

207
00:11:02,194 --> 00:11:04,129
STOP IT! YOU ANIMALS!

208
00:11:23,381 --> 00:11:26,218
YOU'RE SUSPENDED. FOR THE REST OF THE DAY.

209
00:11:26,251 --> 00:11:27,586
BUT I DIDN'T THROW ANYTHING!

210
00:11:27,619 --> 00:11:29,254
YOU STARTED IT, BY ALL ACCOUNTS.

211
00:11:29,287 --> 00:11:31,289
FIRST THE FLYERS, AND THEN ALL THIS-

212
00:11:31,323 --> 00:11:33,892
SO THAT'S WHAT THIS IS ABOUT.

213
00:11:33,925 --> 00:11:36,928
YOU'RE PUNISHING ME FOR PROTESTING?

214
00:11:38,497 --> 00:11:42,834
IF YOU'RE CALLING MY MOM, SHE'S AWAY AT A STYLIST'S CONVENTION.

215
00:11:42,868 --> 00:11:44,936
THEN I'LL RELEASE YOU TO YOUR STEPFATHER.

216
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:45,937
FINE. ARCHIE -

217
00:11:48,773 --> 00:11:52,177
MR. SIMPSON WILL SUPPORT ME. 100 PERCENT.

218
00:11:53,011 --> 00:11:54,846
OKAY GUYS, YOUR ESSAYS ON "OLIVER TWIST"

219
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:57,382
ARE DUE ON MONDAY. NO EXCUSES.

220
00:11:59,518 --> 00:12:01,319
YOU HEARD THE NEW KID ELRICK?

221
00:12:01,353 --> 00:12:04,222
HOLD ON, I GOT IT ON MY PLAYER...

222
00:12:10,562 --> 00:12:13,465
WAIT A MINUTE. MY MP3 PLAYER.

223
00:12:13,498 --> 00:12:14,499
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

224
00:12:14,533 --> 00:12:16,535
IT'S GONE. I'VE LOST IT.

225
00:12:17,502 --> 00:12:19,204
I'M SUCH AN IDIOT!

226
00:12:20,005 --> 00:12:22,274
WHOA! BE CAREFUL WITH YOUR NEW BAG, JIMMY.

227
00:12:22,307 --> 00:12:24,843
YOU DON'T WANT TO MAKE PA-PA ANGRY.

228
00:12:24,876 --> 00:12:26,044
I DON'T WANNA HEAR IT.

229
00:12:26,077 --> 00:12:28,246
HEAR WHAT? THAT YOU SHOULD TAKE BETTER CARE OF YOUR STUFF?

230
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:28,980
HEY SPINNER -

231
00:12:29,014 --> 00:12:29,915
WHAT DOES JIMMY CARE?

232
00:12:29,948 --> 00:12:31,917
HIS RICH DAD WILL JUST BUY HIM A NEW ONE.

233
00:12:31,950 --> 00:12:33,518
MAN, YOU'RE SO JEALOUS.

234
00:12:33,552 --> 00:12:34,219
I'M NOT.

235
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:36,788
BESIDES, I CAN BUY MY OWN STUFF.

236
00:12:36,821 --> 00:12:40,492
I'M GONNA ORDER A TRIPLE 5 SOUL HOODIE TODAY.

237
00:12:40,525 --> 00:12:42,294
TRIPLE 5 SOUL?

238
00:12:42,327 --> 00:12:43,728
SINCE WHEN DO YOU HAVE MONEY TO PAY FOR THAT?

239
00:12:43,762 --> 00:12:46,364
SINCE... NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS.

240
00:12:52,637 --> 00:12:53,738
AND WHEN ADJUSTING THE SCREEN COLOURS,

241
00:12:53,772 --> 00:12:55,740
THIS SHOULD BE A SMOOTH RAINBOW,

242
00:12:55,774 --> 00:12:57,576
WITH NO BANDING OR DOTS.

243
00:12:57,609 --> 00:12:59,644
NOW JUST AS IMPORTANT AS THE COLOUR ARE THE GAMMA

244
00:12:59,678 --> 00:13:00,579
AND THE CONTRAST -

245
00:13:00,612 --> 00:13:01,880
(KNOCK AT DOOR)

246
00:13:06,551 --> 00:13:09,020
EMMA? WHY AREN'T YOU AT HOME?

247
00:13:09,054 --> 00:13:10,622
MR. RADITCH SUSPENDED YOU.

248
00:13:10,655 --> 00:13:13,592
YES HE DID. AND I THINK IT'S WRONG.

249
00:13:18,530 --> 00:13:19,698
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

250
00:13:19,731 --> 00:13:22,300
I'M WAITING FOR YOU TO CONTINUE YOUR LESSON.

251
00:13:22,334 --> 00:13:24,970
YOU'LL HAVE TO WAIT TILL TOMORROW. YOU'RE SUSPENDED.

252
00:13:25,003 --> 00:13:26,871
WHY? FOR SPEAKING MY MIND?

253
00:13:26,905 --> 00:13:28,740
IT'S CALLED FREEDOM OF SPEECH.

254
00:13:28,773 --> 00:13:30,842
AND I HAVE A RIGHT TO AN EDUCATION.

255
00:13:30,875 --> 00:13:31,943
IT'S CALLED A FOOD FIGHT.

256
00:13:31,977 --> 00:13:33,979
I DIDN'T START IT.

257
00:13:34,012 --> 00:13:35,380
INTENTIONALLY.

258
00:13:38,950 --> 00:13:41,553
LET'S HAVE A TALK IN PRIVATE.

259
00:13:43,088 --> 00:13:45,624
GOOD GIRL GONE SO BAD.

260
00:13:50,762 --> 00:13:53,598
WHAT IS THIS REALLY ABOUT, HM?

261
00:13:53,632 --> 00:13:55,333
ARE YOU TESTING ME?

262
00:13:55,367 --> 00:13:58,003
IT'S NOT YOU, IT'S RADITCH.

263
00:13:58,036 --> 00:14:02,874
AND SINCE YOU'RE MY NEW 'DAD', I THOUGHT YOU'D SUPPORT ME.

264
00:14:03,541 --> 00:14:07,612
EMMA, YOU'RE SUSPENDED. YOU HAVE TO GO HOME. NOW.

265
00:14:28,033 --> 00:14:30,502
SULLY, MY FRIEND.

266
00:14:30,535 --> 00:14:34,039
REMEMBER LAST WEEK - WE WERE TALKING MP3 PLAYERS?

267
00:14:34,072 --> 00:14:35,106
YEAH.

268
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:36,908
WELL, YOU SAID YOU'D DO ANYTHING TO GET YOUR HANDS

269
00:14:36,941 --> 00:14:38,677
ON A MODEL LIKE THIS?

270
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:44,082
WOW. HOW'D YOU GET THAT?

271
00:14:45,183 --> 00:14:46,985
MY DAD. BIRTHDAY PRESENT.

272
00:14:47,018 --> 00:14:48,987
ANYWAY, YOU WANNA BUY IT?

273
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:50,689
A HUNDRED AND TWENTY BUCKS.

274
00:14:50,722 --> 00:14:52,390
AT THAT PRICE? DEAL.

275
00:14:54,826 --> 00:14:56,828
THIS ISN'T STOLEN IS IT?

276
00:14:57,562 --> 00:14:59,731
UNH, DO YOU WANT IT OR NOT?

277
00:15:00,065 --> 00:15:01,433
ALL RIGHT, YEAH.

278
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,036
MEET ME IN THE FOYER AFTER SCHOOL.

279
00:15:13,912 --> 00:15:14,346
TOBY!

280
00:15:14,379 --> 00:15:15,747
HERE.

281
00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:17,882
DIDN'T THINK I'D EVER SEE THIS. EMMA NELSON, SUSPENDED?

282
00:15:17,916 --> 00:15:20,785
YEP, SHE WENT BANANAS. CUCKOO. LIKE JOAN OF ARC.

283
00:15:20,819 --> 00:15:25,090
JT, SHUT UP. HOW ABOUT A LITTLE SUPPORT?

284
00:15:25,123 --> 00:15:27,392
SHE REALLY HAS GONE INSANE.

285
00:15:28,093 --> 00:15:29,627
SO YOU DON'T MIND ANSWERING A FEW QUESTIONS

286
00:15:29,661 --> 00:15:30,895
FOR THE GRAPEVINE?

287
00:15:30,929 --> 00:15:32,530
NOT AT ALL.

288
00:15:33,732 --> 00:15:35,600
PRINCIPAL RADITCH SUSPENDED YOU?

289
00:15:35,633 --> 00:15:37,435
HE BLAMED ME FOR THE FOOD FIGHT.

290
00:15:37,469 --> 00:15:39,571
FOR MY PROTEST OVER GM FOODS.

291
00:15:39,604 --> 00:15:42,874
WE KNOW YOUR POSITION. YOU'RE AGAINST GM FOODS.

292
00:15:42,907 --> 00:15:44,843
IT'S NOT ABOUT THAT ANYMORE.

293
00:15:44,876 --> 00:15:46,611
THEN WHAT IS IT ABOUT?

294
00:15:46,644 --> 00:15:50,448
IT'S ABOUT FREEDOM OF SPEECH. IT'S ABOUT MY RIGHT TO PROTEST.

295
00:15:50,482 --> 00:15:52,984
THIS INTERVIEW IS OVER, ELLIE.

296
00:15:56,988 --> 00:15:58,590
YOU ABOUT DONE HERE, MISS NELSON?

297
00:15:58,623 --> 00:15:59,557
I'M NOT ON SCHOOL PROPERTY

298
00:15:59,591 --> 00:16:01,993
AND I'M NOT LEAVING UNTIL MY VOICE IS HEARD.

299
00:16:02,026 --> 00:16:04,763
OH, YOUR VOICE WILL BE HEARD.

300
00:16:04,796 --> 00:16:07,465
THAT SOUNDS LIKE A THREAT - SIR.

301
00:16:09,234 --> 00:16:10,935
IT'S A SUGGESTION.

302
00:16:11,703 --> 00:16:12,871
YOU EITHER APOLOGIZE FOR ALL THIS

303
00:16:12,904 --> 00:16:14,606
ON TOMORROW MORNING'S VIDEO ANNOUNCEMENTS,

304
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:17,175
OR YOU GET A ONE WEEK SUSPENSION.

305
00:16:39,130 --> 00:16:41,166
LOOK, I'M SORRY, OKAY?

306
00:16:42,033 --> 00:16:42,967
FOR WHAT?

307
00:16:43,902 --> 00:16:45,770
FOR MAKING FUN OF YOUR SHIRT OR WHATEVER.

308
00:16:45,804 --> 00:16:47,038
IT WAS JUST A JOKE.

309
00:16:47,071 --> 00:16:49,674
OKAY. FINE. APOLOGY ACCEPTED.

310
00:16:54,612 --> 00:16:57,148
WHAT? WHY ARE YOU STILL HERE?

311
00:16:57,182 --> 00:17:00,518
COME ON, ISN'T THIS THE PART WHERE WE WALK HOME TOGETHER,

312
00:17:00,552 --> 00:17:02,053
BEST FRIENDS AGAIN?

313
00:17:02,086 --> 00:17:04,055
HEY SPINNER.

314
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:08,059
UM, WHY DON'T WE AH JUST WALK TO SCHOOL TOMORROW, OKAY?

315
00:17:08,092 --> 00:17:10,128
I'LL BE, UH, HAPPIER THEN. OKAY?

316
00:17:10,161 --> 00:17:12,130
I GOT YOUR MONEY -

317
00:17:13,198 --> 00:17:14,899
GIVE ME THE GOODS.

318
00:17:16,167 --> 00:17:18,670
UH - SULLY HERE JUST OWES ME MONEY -

319
00:17:18,703 --> 00:17:21,105
AH LOSER OWES ME AN MP3 PLAYER.

320
00:17:22,340 --> 00:17:25,176
TOP OF THE LINE - THE BEST.

321
00:17:25,944 --> 00:17:28,546
HUNDRED AND TWENTY BUCKS!

322
00:17:30,949 --> 00:17:33,017
WOW. SOUNDS LIKE A STEAL.

323
00:17:40,959 --> 00:17:44,562
SO? ARE YOU SELLING IT OR WHAT?

324
00:17:55,006 --> 00:17:56,040
HEY.

325
00:17:56,374 --> 00:17:59,577
YOU MIGHT AS WELL GET IT OVER WITH.

326
00:17:59,611 --> 00:18:01,045
GET WHAT OVER WITH?

327
00:18:01,079 --> 00:18:03,081
THE YELLING. THE SPEECH.

328
00:18:03,114 --> 00:18:05,917
THE "YOU'RE IN SERIOUS TROUBLE" TALK.

329
00:18:05,950 --> 00:18:09,120
I THINK YOU'VE PROBABLY HEARD ENOUGH SPEECHES TODAY.

330
00:18:09,153 --> 00:18:11,689
DID YOU HEAR MR. RADITCH?

331
00:18:11,723 --> 00:18:13,591
I EITHER APOLOGIZE ON THE ANNOUNCEMENTS -

332
00:18:13,625 --> 00:18:15,026
OR I GET SUSPENDED.

333
00:18:16,995 --> 00:18:17,061
(Sigh) AH.

334
00:18:19,764 --> 00:18:23,234
I CAN'T. I CAN'T APOLOGIZE FOR DOING SOMETHING I BELIEVE IN.

335
00:18:23,268 --> 00:18:26,137
EMMA, THERE ARE HILLS TO DIE ON.

336
00:18:26,905 --> 00:18:28,139
ARE YOU SURE THIS IS ONE OF THEM?

337
00:18:28,172 --> 00:18:31,242
YOU AND MOM HAVE A BABY ON THE WAY -

338
00:18:31,276 --> 00:18:34,012
MY LITTLE BROTHER OR SISTER.

339
00:18:34,045 --> 00:18:36,247
AREN'T YOU WORRIED?

340
00:18:36,281 --> 00:18:38,716
DO YOU REALLY WANT THEM EATING THIS WEIRD -

341
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:39,984
FRANKENSTEIN FOOD?

342
00:18:40,018 --> 00:18:41,185
WE DON'T EVEN KNOW IF IT'S HARMFUL -

343
00:18:41,219 --> 00:18:44,656
WE DON'T KNOW IF IT'S SAFE.

344
00:18:44,689 --> 00:18:47,625
AND I'M SCARED TO TAKE THAT CHANCE.

345
00:18:51,963 --> 00:18:53,631
YOU KNOW, AS PART OF YOUR FAMILY,

346
00:18:53,665 --> 00:18:55,300
I TOTALLY SUPPORT YOU.

347
00:18:56,834 --> 00:18:58,369
BUT AS YOUR TEACHER...

348
00:18:58,403 --> 00:18:59,804
YOU'RE STUCK.

349
00:18:59,837 --> 00:19:01,039
YEAH. I'M STUCK.

350
00:19:03,207 --> 00:19:08,279
SO I THINK YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO MAKE THIS DECISION ON YOUR OWN.

351
00:19:17,221 --> 00:19:19,223
LET ME GET, ONE OF SHEILA'S BREAKFAST BURRITOS,

352
00:19:19,257 --> 00:19:21,759
AND A SIDE OF HOMEFRIES.

353
00:19:27,298 --> 00:19:31,035
YOUR FOOD WILL BE COMING UP IN A MOMENT, SIR.

354
00:19:31,803 --> 00:19:32,270
SPIN.

355
00:19:33,171 --> 00:19:36,307
IT'S GAVIN, WHEN I'M IN THE HAIR NET.

356
00:19:38,409 --> 00:19:40,745
LOOK I'M REALLY SORRY, OKAY.

357
00:19:42,347 --> 00:19:45,984
YOU GET, LIKE, WHATEVER YOU WANT.

358
00:19:46,017 --> 00:19:48,987
AND I CAN'T EVEN AFFORD -

359
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:49,754
ANYTHING.

360
00:19:52,724 --> 00:19:53,958
SO YOU STEAL IT..

361
00:19:53,992 --> 00:19:54,258
NO.

362
00:19:56,361 --> 00:20:00,031
I MEAN, YEAH, I WAS GOING TO BUT I COULDN'T.

363
00:20:04,936 --> 00:20:06,771
YOU'RE MY BEST FRIEND.

364
00:20:10,041 --> 00:20:10,375
WAS.

365
00:20:21,753 --> 00:20:22,520
VERY GOOD, EMMA.

366
00:20:22,553 --> 00:20:24,989
I'M GLAD WE STRAIGHTENED THIS OUT.

367
00:20:25,023 --> 00:20:26,758
THANK YOU, SIR.

368
00:20:30,261 --> 00:20:31,763
WE BEGIN OUR MORNING ANNOUNCEMENTS

369
00:20:31,796 --> 00:20:34,198
WITH A WORD FROM EMMA NELSON.

370
00:20:40,204 --> 00:20:42,774
FELLOW STUDENTS, STAFF AND FACULTY.

371
00:20:42,807 --> 00:20:45,376
I'VE BEEN ASKED HERE THIS MORNING TO APOLOGIZE

372
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:47,779
TO YOU AND TO MR. RADITCH.

373
00:20:52,550 --> 00:20:53,751
BUT I CAN'T.

374
00:20:54,786 --> 00:20:57,488
I CAN'T APOLOGIZE FOR WANTING TO BE HEARD.

375
00:20:57,522 --> 00:20:58,489
I'M SORRY THE FOOD FIGHT HAPPENED,

376
00:20:58,523 --> 00:21:01,025
AND FOR MAKING A MESS IN SHEILA'S CAFETERIA.

377
00:21:01,059 --> 00:21:01,893
BUT OTHER THAN THAT?

378
00:21:01,926 --> 00:21:05,196
I FEEL I DID NOTHING WRONG YESTERDAY.

379
00:21:06,397 --> 00:21:08,066
YOU CAN AGREE OR DISAGREE WITH ME ABOUT GM FOODS.

380
00:21:08,099 --> 00:21:09,534
THAT'S NOT THE POINT.

381
00:21:09,567 --> 00:21:12,770
THE POINT IS I HAVE A RIGHT TO EXPRESS MY OPINION,

382
00:21:12,804 --> 00:21:15,173
AND YOU HAVE A RIGHT TO BE INFORMED.

383
00:21:15,206 --> 00:21:17,542
IF FIGHTING FOR THAT WILL GET ME A WEEK'S SUSPENSION THEN -

384
00:21:17,575 --> 00:21:20,111
I CAN LIVE WITH THAT.

385
00:21:29,053 --> 00:21:31,756
GUESS I'M GOING HOME NOW, HUH?

386
00:21:33,591 --> 00:21:36,294
YES, YOU ARE.
