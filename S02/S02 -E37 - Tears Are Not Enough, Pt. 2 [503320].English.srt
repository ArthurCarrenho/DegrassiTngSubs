WHAT DOES IT MATTER, ANYWAY?

151
00:07:05,523 --> 00:07:09,227

171
00:09:09,814 --> 00:09:11,482
A TOP-NOTCH SURGEON,

00:09:13,551 --> 00:09:17,088
AN ABSOLUTELY DEVASTATING SQUASH PLAYER,

173
00:09:17,622 --> 00:09:19,557
AND A DEDICATED FATHER.

174
00:09:20,658 --> 00:09:22,460
BUT IF YOU WERE TO ASK HIM?

175
00:09:22,493 --> 00:09:26,230

180
00:09:34,939 --> 00:09:37,375
A GIFT HE CHERISHED.

181
00:09:37,408 --> 00:09:39,610
A GIFT HE NEVER WANTED TO RELINQUISH.

182
00:09:39,644 --> 00:09:40,478
(Laughing)

183
00:09:43,181 --> 00:09:45,583
MAYBE CRAIG NEEDS SOME AIR.

184
00:09:45,616 --> 00:09:47,285
CRAIG, COME ON. LET'S GO OUTSIDE.

185
00:09:47,318 --> 00:09:47,618
SORRY.

186
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:51,322
... THIS IS WHY HE WAS A GREAT DOCTOR AND A GREAT SURGEON.

187
00:09:51,355 --> 00:09:52,356
WE'RE GONNA MISS HIM.

188
00:09:52,390 --> 00:09:53,224
(Laughing)

189
00:09:57,428 --> 00:09:58,262
(Laughing)

190
00:09:59,230 --> 00:10:00,932
CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT IDIOT?

191
00:10:00,965 --> 00:10:04,368
"ALBERT MANNING WAS A DEDICATED FATHER..."

192
00:10:04,402 --> 00:10:07,371
CRAIG, YOU AND YOUR FATHER HAD A COMPLICATED RELATIONSHIP-

193
00:10:07,405 --> 00:10:09,307
YEAH, HE BEAT ME.

194
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:11,409
NOT GONNA DO THAT AGAIN NOW, IS HE?

195
00:10:11,442 --> 00:10:13,377
COME ON.

196
00:10:13,411 --> 00:10:14,745
I'M HAPPY, JOEY.

197
00:10:15,847 --> 00:10:18,783
I'M REALLY HAPPY... 'CAUSE HE'S DEAD.

198
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:24,589
'CAUSE HE'S GONE FOR GOOD.

199
00:10:28,326 --> 00:10:29,660
IT WAS DISTURBING.

200
00:10:29,694 --> 00:10:32,663
THE COFFIN'S RIGHT THERE, AND CRAIG'S LAUGHING.

201
00:10:32,697 --> 00:10:34,866
FUNERALS ARE STRESSFUL.

202
00:10:34,899 --> 00:10:35,967
WEIRD THINGS HAPPEN.

203
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:36,601
LADIES...

204
00:10:37,635 --> 00:10:38,803
HEY CRAIG.

205
00:10:38,836 --> 00:10:39,670
HEY.

206
00:10:39,704 --> 00:10:43,674
YOU READY FOR THE HAWAIIAN SURF PARADISE?

207
00:10:43,708 --> 00:10:45,576
UM SURE. CAN'T WAIT.

208
00:10:48,679 --> 00:10:50,948
HEY, SAVE THE FILM FOR TONIGHT...

209
00:10:50,982 --> 00:10:53,818
WHEN ASH AND I WIN THE LUAU CROWN.

210
00:10:56,487 --> 00:10:58,422
YOU PUT US IN THE CONTEST?

211
00:10:58,456 --> 00:11:02,627
YEAH. THIS IS OUR NIGHT. EVERYONE'S GONNA KNOW IT.

212
00:11:04,529 --> 00:11:05,029
OKAY...

213
00:11:05,062 --> 00:11:05,830
GREAT.

214
00:11:05,863 --> 00:11:07,698
UH, I GOTTA GO CLEAN OUT MY LOCKER.

215
00:11:07,732 --> 00:11:09,667
BUT I'LL SEE YOU LATER.

216
00:11:16,507 --> 00:11:17,542
SO YOU GET IN,

217
00:11:17,575 --> 00:11:18,509
PULL THE LID DOWN,

218
00:11:18,543 --> 00:11:20,745
PRESS THE START BUTTON.

219
00:11:20,778 --> 00:11:21,979
UM, WAIT.

220
00:11:22,013 --> 00:11:23,681
DO I REALLY HAVE TO PULL THE LID DOWN?

221
00:11:23,714 --> 00:11:25,683
CAUSE I'M KINDA CLAUSTROPHOBIC.

222
00:11:25,716 --> 00:11:29,520
IF YOU REALLY WANT TO TAN, YEAH.

223
00:11:49,707 --> 00:11:51,042
I CAN DO THIS. OKAY, OKAY...

224
00:11:51,075 --> 00:11:54,045
WHAT... WHAT DID HE-OH, OH NO, OH NO!

225
00:11:54,078 --> 00:11:54,812
(Screams)

226
00:11:59,417 --> 00:12:01,252
WHAT WAS THAT?

227
00:12:05,356 --> 00:12:07,592
OKAY PAIGE. I CAN'T DO IT! I CAN'T!

228
00:12:07,625 --> 00:12:08,759
I TOLD YOU I WAS CLAUSTROPHOBIC!

229
00:12:08,793 --> 00:12:11,862
SPINNER... CAN I AT LEAST HAVE MY TURN NOW?

230
00:12:11,896 --> 00:12:12,730
NO!

231
00:12:13,664 --> 00:12:16,801
I'M SCARED. I WANNA GO HOME.

232
00:12:16,834 --> 00:12:18,803
I'LL TAN MY WAY, YOU TAN YOURS.

233
00:12:18,836 --> 00:12:19,770
OKAY?

234
00:12:21,038 --> 00:12:21,872
FOLLOW ME.

235
00:12:28,613 --> 00:12:29,447
CRAIG.

236
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:30,581
OH, YOU GOT THE BIG DANCE TONIGHT?

237
00:12:30,615 --> 00:12:31,682
YEAH.

238
00:12:32,450 --> 00:12:33,284
OH, I HOPE YOU DON'T MIND,

239
00:12:33,317 --> 00:12:35,353
BUT I BORROWED ONE OF YOUR OLD SHIRTS.

240
00:12:35,386 --> 00:12:37,521
KNOCK YOURSELF OUT.

241
00:12:37,555 --> 00:12:39,357
HEY LISTEN BEFORE YOU GO TO ARUBA, I WANTED TO-

242
00:12:39,390 --> 00:12:39,657
HAWAII.

243
00:12:39,690 --> 00:12:40,992
RIGHT.

244
00:12:41,025 --> 00:12:42,960
UM, LOOK, I HATE TO BRING THIS UP

245
00:12:42,994 --> 00:12:44,595
BUT WE HAVE TO GO OVER WHAT YOU GONNA SAY TOMORROW

246
00:12:44,629 --> 00:12:45,896
AT CHILDREN'S AID.

247
00:12:45,930 --> 00:12:46,464
NOW?

248
00:12:47,265 --> 00:12:48,933
YEAH, IF THAT'S OKAY.

249
00:12:48,966 --> 00:12:51,502
UM, IT'S JUST I'M A BIT DISTRACTED.

250
00:12:51,535 --> 00:12:53,738
YOU KNOW - ASHLEY, THE DANCE.

251
00:12:59,110 --> 00:13:01,579
YOU DON'T THINK I SHOULD GO, DO YOU?

252
00:13:01,612 --> 00:13:02,713
NO. I DO.

253
00:13:02,747 --> 00:13:04,582
I THINK IT'S GREAT YOU'RE TRYING TO HAVE FUN, CRAIG

254
00:13:04,615 --> 00:13:05,516
BUT...

255
00:13:05,549 --> 00:13:06,951
BUT WHAT? I'M FINE.

256
00:13:09,654 --> 00:13:12,623
NO ONE IS "FINE" AFTER LOSING SOMEONE.

257
00:13:14,058 --> 00:13:16,594
I WASN'T, WITH YOUR MOM.

258
00:13:16,627 --> 00:13:20,498
I JUST THINK THE PAIN IS GONNA CATCH UP TO YOU.

259
00:13:20,531 --> 00:13:22,700
I'VE GOT A DANCE TO GO TO.

260
00:13:27,171 --> 00:13:28,506
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN!

261
00:13:28,539 --> 00:13:30,574

00:13:36,681 --> 00:13:39,550
STEP RIGHT UP AND VOTE FOR LUAU KING AND QUEEN.

265
00:13:39,583 --> 00:13:41,686
ALOHA. WELCOME TO DEGRASSI ISLAND.

ALOHA AND- (Laughs)

271
00:13:54,665 --> 00:13:56,734
WELCOME TO DEGRASSI ISLAND.

272
00:13:57,902 --> 00:13:58,803
WHAT ARE YOU LAUGHING AT?

273
00:13:58,836 --> 00:14:01,539
YOUR LAME ATTEMPT AT STEALING OUR VOTES?

274
00:14:01,572 --> 00:14:05,443
RED, I DON'T HAVE TO STEAL ANYTHING TONIGHT.

275
00:14:05,476 --> 00:14:07,645
BUT HEY, MAYBE SPIN COULD TRY.

276
00:14:07,678 --> 00:14:09,880
DUDE, LIKE - ANCIENT HISTORY.

277
00:14:11,582 --> 00:14:12,750
(Dance Music)

278
00:14:21,058 --> 00:14:22,193
SPIN!

279
00:14:22,226 --> 00:14:26,797
SPIN, IF YOU WANT TO WIN, STOP DOING THAT ROBOT THING!

280
00:14:29,967 --> 00:14:31,135
(Dance Music)

281
00:14:46,884 --> 00:14:48,486
GOTH LUAU - COOL.

282
00:14:49,153 --> 00:14:50,588
I THOUGHT IT'D SET US APART.

283
00:14:50,621 --> 00:14:52,690
AND YOU KNOW, KEEP YOUR DIGNITY INTACT.

284
00:14:52,723 --> 00:14:55,659
UNTIL WE START TO LIMBO, OF COURSE...

285
00:15:01,599 --> 00:15:02,767
GUYS!

286
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:05,202
(Taps staff on floor)

287
00:15:05,803 --> 00:15:07,605
THE TIME HAS COME.

288
00:15:07,638 --> 00:15:10,708
VOTES ARE IN FOR LUAU KING AND QUEEN.

289
00:15:14,945 --> 00:15:17,548
OH AND UH, THANKS TO TOBY ISAACS AND KENDRA MASON

290
00:15:17,581 --> 00:15:20,751

AND THE WINNER IS...

292
00:15:24,789 --> 00:15:26,957

00:15:26,991 --> 00:15:29,660
ASHLEY KERWIN AND CRAIG MANNING!

294
00:15:30,861 --> 00:15:31,695
(Cheering)

295
00:15:55,786 --> 00:15:56,720
DAD.

296
00:15:57,655 --> 00:15:57,721
DAD?

297
00:16:01,592 --> 00:16:01,725
DAD.

298
00:16:04,895 --> 00:16:05,729
DAD?

299
00:16:07,231 --> 00:16:08,065
DAD.

300
00:16:08,899 --> 00:16:10,067
DAD, DAD LOOK!

301
00:16:11,702 --> 00:16:14,038
LOOK - LOOK, I'VE WON!

302
00:16:14,839 --> 00:16:15,539
SORRY.

303
00:16:16,807 --> 00:16:20,077
I'M SORRY MR. BOYD. I THOUGHT YOU WERE...

304
00:16:37,228 --> 00:16:40,297
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN? THEY'RE WAITING FOR OUR DANCE.

305
00:16:40,331 --> 00:16:42,199
CRAIG, ARE YOU OKAY?

306
00:16:42,233 --> 00:16:45,603
LOOK, I'M FINE. I'M JUST REALLY TIRED.

307
00:16:46,070 --> 00:16:48,806
I KNEW COMING HERE WAS A MISTAKE.

308
00:16:49,773 --> 00:16:49,974
WHAT?

309
00:16:51,108 --> 00:16:53,577
IT'S TOO SOON. YOU SHOULD BE HOME.

310
00:16:53,611 --> 00:16:56,814
COULD YOU, LIKE, REVEL IN THIS ANY MORE -

311
00:16:57,615 --> 00:16:58,148
MS. GOTH!

312
00:16:58,749 --> 00:17:00,751
MS. DOOM AND GLOOM!

313
00:17:00,784 --> 00:17:02,920
THAT'S NOT FAIR. I'M JUST CONCERNED ABOUT YOU.

314
00:17:02,953 --> 00:17:05,122
WELL I'M SICK OF YOU, AND EVERYONE,

315
00:17:05,155 --> 00:17:06,357
JUST BEING CONCERNED.

316
00:17:06,390 --> 00:17:07,591
CRAIG-

317
00:17:21,171 --> 00:17:22,940
LET HIM COOL DOWN.

318
00:17:22,973 --> 00:17:24,074
EVERYONE BACK INTO THE DANCE.

319
00:17:24,108 --> 00:17:27,711
I'LL CHECK IN ON CRAIG IN A MINUTE.

320
00:17:49,199 --> 00:17:51,168
WHAT'S WRONG WITH ME?

321
00:17:51,201 --> 00:17:51,869
NOTHING.

322
00:17:53,237 --> 00:17:55,639
YOU'RE ANGRY, AND YOU'RE SAD.

323
00:18:01,312 --> 00:18:04,348
THIS WAS SUPPOSED TO BE MY NIGHT.

324
00:18:04,381 --> 00:18:05,282
I'M WITH ASH!

325
00:18:05,316 --> 00:18:08,752
WE'RE THE STUPID LUAU KING AND QUEEN!

326
00:18:21,432 --> 00:18:22,833
WHEN MY MOM DIED,

327
00:18:24,468 --> 00:18:27,671
I WAS AT MY FRIEND'S BIRTHDAY PARTY.

328
00:18:29,807 --> 00:18:34,812
I WAS HAVING A GREAT TIME - AND THEN MY DAD CAME TO TELL ME.

329
00:18:38,015 --> 00:18:40,017
AT THE PARTY?

330
00:18:40,050 --> 00:18:41,652
YEAH. I WAS SO MAD-

331
00:18:43,721 --> 00:18:46,190
'CAUSE SHE DIED?

332
00:18:46,223 --> 00:18:50,828
NO - 'CAUSE I COULDN'T PLAY PIN THE TAIL ON THE DONKEY.

333
00:18:55,065 --> 00:18:58,702
THAT'S A FUN GAME WHEN YOU'RE A LITTLE KID.

334
00:18:58,736 --> 00:18:59,703
EXACTLY.

335
00:19:00,938 --> 00:19:05,209
IT WASN'T TILL LATER THAT IT HIT - THAT, THAT SHE WAS DEAD.

336
00:19:08,879 --> 00:19:10,681
BEFORE MY DAD DIED -

337
00:19:12,449 --> 00:19:14,151
I WANTED HIM GONE.

338
00:19:17,921 --> 00:19:20,858
SO WHY AM I CRYING, NOW THAT HE IS?

339
00:19:27,364 --> 00:19:29,033
'CAUSE YOU LOVE HIM.

340
00:19:37,141 --> 00:19:38,208
(Crying)

341
00:19:49,887 --> 00:19:51,422
I'M WORRIED ABOUT COMING IN EIGHTH PLACE

342
00:19:51,455 --> 00:19:53,757
IN SOME STUPID LUAU CONTEST

343
00:19:53,791 --> 00:19:55,759
AND POOR CRAIG IS HAVING A BREAKDOWN.

344
00:19:55,793 --> 00:19:56,527
CAN WE SAY SHALLOW?

345
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:57,428
SHALLOW.

346
00:19:58,395 --> 00:20:01,999
WELL, PAIGE ISN'T THE ONLY FREAK.

347
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:05,903
DUDE, WHAT PLAGUE DO YOU HAVE?

348
00:20:05,936 --> 00:20:08,939
YOU KNOW, I THINK IT'S THESE FLOWERS.

349
00:20:08,972 --> 00:20:11,041
I'M ALLERGIC TO THEM.

350
00:20:11,075 --> 00:20:13,310
AT LEAST YOU DON'T HAVE RADIOACTIVE SKIN.

351
00:20:13,343 --> 00:20:15,345
OR A PUMPKIN FOR A DATE.

352
00:20:15,846 --> 00:20:18,115
A PUMPKIN IN A DRESS.

353
00:20:20,317 --> 00:20:22,186
OH, LOSERS -

354
00:20:22,953 --> 00:20:25,956
I'D SAY YEARBOOK, FRONT COVER.

355
00:20:37,468 --> 00:20:39,570
GOING SOMEWHERE?

356
00:20:39,603 --> 00:20:41,205
ARE YOU?

357
00:20:42,406 --> 00:20:44,441
SOON. I WANNA GO HOME.

358
00:20:50,447 --> 00:20:53,117
I THINK WE OWE EVERYONE A DANCE.

359
00:21:07,598 --> 00:21:09,299
YOU CAN ASK.

360
00:21:12,202 --> 00:21:13,270
ASK WHAT?

361
00:21:14,505 --> 00:21:16,373
HOW I'M DOING.

362
00:21:17,274 --> 00:21:19,243
