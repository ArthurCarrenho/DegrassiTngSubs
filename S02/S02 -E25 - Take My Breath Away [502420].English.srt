00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:04,870
C.S. LEWIS CALLED ROMANCE 'THE RELIGION OF LOVE'.

2
00:00:04,903 --> 00:00:07,906
BUT FOR MANY WRITERS, ROMANCE ISN'T SO SIMPLE.

3
00:00:07,939 --> 00:00:10,709
IT IS OFTEN A CONFUSING EXPERIENCE.

4
00:00:10,742 --> 00:00:11,576
(Knocking)

5
00:00:12,544 --> 00:00:14,780
EXCUSE ME, MS. KWAN? I'M SORRY TO INTERRUPT.

6
00:00:15,547 --> 00:00:16,615
BUT UM...

7
00:00:17,749 --> 00:00:21,486
BUT, I'VE COME TO COLLECT MY ONE AND ONLY TRUE LOVE.

8
00:00:27,492 --> 00:00:30,028
♪ WON'T YOU BE MY CINDERELLA?

9
00:00:33,031 --> 00:00:35,834
♪ COULD I KISS YOU MANUELA?

10
00:00:38,904 --> 00:00:40,706
♪ YOU CAN SEE ME, HOWEVER

11
00:00:45,777 --> 00:00:47,846
♪ YOU MUST LOVE ME FOREVER.

12
00:00:50,949 --> 00:00:51,817
♪ FOREVER.

13
00:00:56,688 --> 00:00:57,956
I NEED TO GET THAT.

14
00:00:57,989 --> 00:00:58,824
PARDON ME?

15
00:01:00,892 --> 00:01:02,761
THE AV CART BEHIND YOU.

16
00:01:02,794 --> 00:01:04,096
MR. SIMPSON SENT ME TO GET IT.

17
00:01:04,129 --> 00:01:06,865
AND UM, YOU'RE ON THE CORD.

18
00:01:10,135 --> 00:01:12,738
YEAH, YOU COULD JUST MOVE IT.

19
00:01:15,941 --> 00:01:17,876
♪ Whatever it takes

20
00:01:19,544 --> 00:01:22,180
♪ I know I can make it through

21
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:26,151
♪ If I hold out

22
00:01:28,253 --> 00:01:31,089
♪ I know I can make it through

23
00:01:36,561 --> 00:01:37,929
♪ Be the best

24
00:01:37,963 --> 00:01:40,499
♪ The best that I can be

25
00:01:41,566 --> 00:01:43,902
♪ Hear what I say to you

26
00:01:44,803 --> 00:01:46,805
♪ What ever it takes

00:01:52,944 --> 00:01:55,781
♪ I know I can make it through

29
00:02:05,891 --> 00:02:06,892
HE'S COMING!

30
00:02:08,326 --> 00:02:12,063
MR. SIMPSON, SOMETHING HORRIBLE HAS HAPPENED TO YOUR COMPUTER!

31
00:02:12,097 --> 00:02:15,267
JT, DID YOU EMAIL ME NAKED BABOON PICTURES AGAIN?

32
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:19,504
IT'S SERIOUS. I THINK YOUR COMPUTER HAS A VIRUS.

33
00:02:28,079 --> 00:02:29,815
YOU HAD ME GOING.

34
00:02:29,848 --> 00:02:30,715
WHO DID THIS?

35
00:02:32,951 --> 00:02:34,786
SO, YOU'RE NOT UPSET THAT I TOLD EVERYONE

36
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:36,254
YOU AND MOM GOT ENGAGED?

37
00:02:36,288 --> 00:02:37,756
NO, IT'S SWEET. THANK YOU.

38
00:02:37,789 --> 00:02:41,126
BUT, HOW DOES IT FEEL, MR. SIMPSON,

39
00:02:41,159 --> 00:02:44,763
I MEAN, TO FIND YOUR ONE TRUE LOVE?

40
00:02:46,298 --> 00:02:50,001
WELL, I JUST HOPE ONE DAY ALL OF YOU FIND SOMEONE

41
00:02:50,035 --> 00:02:51,937
WHO TRULY MAKES YOU HAPPY.

42
00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:54,806
OKAY. WE STILL HAVE STUFF TO LEARN TODAY.

43
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,741
SO, BACK TO YOUR SEATS.

44
00:02:56,775 --> 00:03:00,245
WHO CAN TELL ME THE SIZE OF A KILOBIT?

45
00:03:00,946 --> 00:03:03,181
THE RING IS SO NICE.

46
00:03:03,215 --> 00:03:04,883
A DIAMOND SOLITAIRE WITH A PLATINUM SETTING.

47
00:03:04,916 --> 00:03:07,319
MR. SIMPSON LET ME HELP HIM PICK IT OUT.

48
00:03:07,352 --> 00:03:08,987
HE CHECKED WITH YOU BEFORE HE PROPOSED?

49
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:11,756
NO. BECAUSE MR. SIMPSON DIDN'T PROPOSE.

50
00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:12,724
MY MOM DID.

51
00:03:12,757 --> 00:03:15,894
YOUR MOM DID?! OH, THAT'S COOL.

52
00:03:15,927 --> 00:03:17,929
MANNY, WOMEN CAN PROPOSE TOO.

53
00:03:17,963 --> 00:03:20,332
I KNOW. IT'S JUST NOT AS -

54
00:03:20,365 --> 00:03:21,433
ROMANTIC.

55
00:03:21,466 --> 00:03:24,169
BECAUSE MY MOM SAW WHAT SHE WANTED AND WENT FOR IT?

56
00:03:24,202 --> 00:03:24,870
WHY NOT?

57
00:03:25,804 --> 00:03:26,938
HEY GIRLS.

58
00:03:32,878 --> 00:03:35,814
I THINK CRAIG REALLY LIKES YOU.

59
00:03:35,847 --> 00:03:37,682
THEN WHY DOESN'T HE ASK ME OUT?

60
00:03:37,716 --> 00:03:39,584
UGH! THIS IS TORTURE.

61
00:03:39,618 --> 00:03:41,753
MANNY, THIS IS JUST WHAT WE TALKED ABOUT.

62
00:03:41,786 --> 00:03:44,956
YOU KNOW WHAT YOU WANT. SO, GO FOR IT.

63
00:03:57,736 --> 00:03:59,738
MY FAVORITE LETTER IS E.

64
00:04:01,673 --> 00:04:04,809
"E IS FOR ERNEST WHO CHOKED ON A PEACH."

65
00:04:04,843 --> 00:04:06,678
YOU LIKE EDWARD GOREY?

66
00:04:06,711 --> 00:04:07,946
YEAH, I LOVE HIM.

67
00:04:07,979 --> 00:04:11,683
I MEAN, HIS STUFF IS A PERFECT BALANCE BETWEEN DARK AND FUNNY.

68
00:04:11,716 --> 00:04:14,319
KWAN THOUGHT IT WAS TOO MORBID FOR MY BOOK REPORT.

69
00:04:14,352 --> 00:04:16,254
SO SMALL MINDED, HUH?

70
00:04:16,288 --> 00:04:17,956
NOT LIKE ME AND YOU.

71
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:22,894
I'LL CATCH YOU LATER.

72
00:04:24,729 --> 00:04:26,197
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF MARCO?

73
00:04:26,231 --> 00:04:28,133
KINDA CUTE I GUESS.

74
00:04:28,166 --> 00:04:29,868
I THINK HE'S REALLY CUTE.

75
00:04:29,901 --> 00:04:31,870
WHICH POSES THE QUESTION:

76
00:04:31,903 --> 00:04:33,905
CUTE, NICE, SMART AND STILL SINGLE?

77
00:04:33,939 --> 00:04:36,174
NOT FOR LONG. HAZEL'S ON THE CASE.

78
00:04:36,207 --> 00:04:39,911
THINK I NEED 'HELP' WITH MY MATH HOMEWORK.

79
00:04:45,183 --> 00:04:47,352
HEY, MARCO, I WAS WONDERING IF YOU COULD...

80
00:04:53,425 --> 00:04:55,794
PERSONAL E-MAIL DURING CLASS TIME?

81
00:04:55,827 --> 00:04:57,162
YOU'RE SUCH A REBEL, NASH.

82
00:04:57,195 --> 00:04:58,196
YOU KNOW ME.

83
00:04:59,297 --> 00:05:02,167
NO. 'CAUSE I HAD NO IDEA YOU HAD A CRUSH ON SOMEONE.

84
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:02,734
WHO?

85
00:05:04,402 --> 00:05:05,303
YOU'RE EMBARRASSED.

86
00:05:05,337 --> 00:05:05,804
NO.

87
00:05:06,471 --> 00:05:07,839
AND YOU'RE SHY.

88
00:05:07,872 --> 00:05:09,207
ELLIE NASH. WOW.

89
00:05:10,442 --> 00:05:13,211
I'VE NEVER LIKED ANYONE LIKE THIS BEFORE.

90
00:05:13,244 --> 00:05:14,179
IT'S WEIRD.

91
00:05:15,146 --> 00:05:15,847
IT'S LOVE.

92
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:18,783
IT'S NOT YOUR BUSINESS. SHUT UP.

93
00:05:34,165 --> 00:05:36,067
SORRY I'M LATE.

94
00:05:36,101 --> 00:05:40,271
FLOOD IN THE MEN'S WASHROOM. NOT A PRETTY PICTURE.

95
00:05:58,990 --> 00:05:59,457
FOR YOU.

96
00:06:01,192 --> 00:06:02,027
OH, CRAIG.

97
00:06:03,995 --> 00:06:05,363
DO YOU LIKE ME?

98
00:06:05,397 --> 00:06:06,131
LIKE YOU?

99
00:06:07,332 --> 00:06:09,267
MANNY, I THINK I LOVE--

100
00:06:13,838 --> 00:06:14,439
I'LL SEE YOU LATER.

101
00:06:14,472 --> 00:06:15,006
BYE.

102
00:06:24,049 --> 00:06:25,750
CRAIG? I LIKE YOU.

103
00:06:28,787 --> 00:06:31,322
I CAN'T BELIEVE I JUST SAID THAT.

104
00:06:33,892 --> 00:06:36,061
WELL, NICE TALKING TO YOU.

105
00:06:38,363 --> 00:06:38,963
WAIT.

106
00:06:40,065 --> 00:06:40,565
MANNY?

107
00:06:42,801 --> 00:06:44,436
I, UH, I LIKE YOU TOO.

108
00:06:47,072 --> 00:06:47,472
ARRR!

109
00:06:48,339 --> 00:06:51,810
OH, I'M SORRY! SORRY. I'M SUCH A DITZ!

110
00:06:51,843 --> 00:06:53,311
NO, NO. IT WAS CUTE.

111
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:57,949
SO, CRAIG. TONIGHT? WANNA -

112
00:06:58,817 --> 00:07:00,885
CATCH A MOVIE? AT THE MALL?

113
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:02,987
A MOVIE? SURE.

114
00:07:06,191 --> 00:07:08,126
OH - YOU MEAN WITH YOU?

115
00:07:10,395 --> 00:07:11,763
I DON'T KNOW.

116
00:07:13,998 --> 00:07:15,533
KIDDING! I'M KIDDING.

117
00:07:16,868 --> 00:07:19,037
OKAY. YOU SO HAD ME THERE.

118
00:07:19,938 --> 00:07:21,906
I COULDN'T RESIST.

119
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:24,776
SO PICK ME UP AT EMMA'S OK? SEVEN?

120
00:07:32,484 --> 00:07:35,920
I'LL TALK ABOUT HIGH AND LOW PRESSURE SYSTEMS COLLIDING.

121
00:07:35,954 --> 00:07:36,888
YEAH, COOL.

122
00:07:38,857 --> 00:07:42,026
UH, EL, I GOT THIS REALLY WEIRD EMAIL,

123
00:07:42,861 --> 00:07:44,395
AND IT'S SORT OF CONFUSING ME.

124
00:07:44,429 --> 00:07:46,030
WHAT DOES IT SAY?

125
00:07:47,532 --> 00:07:49,901
'S AS IN SECRET, I ADMIRE.

126
00:07:50,335 --> 00:07:52,003
YOU, FROM A - A FAR.

127
00:07:52,036 --> 00:07:53,438
- XO BAD RHYMER'.

128
00:07:54,405 --> 00:07:55,473
WOW. CRYPTIC.

129
00:07:57,375 --> 00:07:58,843
YEAH, WELL, WHICH IS COOL.

130
00:07:58,877 --> 00:08:01,045
BUT, WHAT DOES IT MEAN?

131
00:08:01,079 --> 00:08:02,580
SOMEONE LIKES YOU?

132
00:08:04,415 --> 00:08:07,418
OKAY. SO WHY TELL ME LIKE THAT?

133
00:08:07,452 --> 00:08:09,354
E-MAIL'S ANONYMOUS.

134
00:08:09,387 --> 00:08:13,591
AFRAID OF THE RESPONSE, IT KEEPS YOU A STEP AWAY.

135
00:08:13,625 --> 00:08:15,059
YOU MEAN YOU'D DO THAT TOO?

136
00:08:15,093 --> 00:08:18,163
TELLING SOMEONE YOU LIKE THEM'S HARD.

137
00:08:18,663 --> 00:08:20,365
YEAH. YEAH, IT IS.

138
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:32,443
BIANCA, I'M SORRY, IT DIDN'T WORK OUT OKAY?

139
00:08:32,477 --> 00:08:35,580
IT'S OVER. YOU HAVE TO STOP CALLING ME NOW.

140
00:08:35,613 --> 00:08:37,015
ALRIGHT? GOODBYE.

141
00:08:38,016 --> 00:08:40,018
SHOULD'VE ENDED IT WEEKS AGO.

142
00:08:40,051 --> 00:08:41,986
LET THAT BE A LESSON.

143
00:08:42,387 --> 00:08:43,521
WHAT ARE YOU ALL DRESSED UP FOR?

144
00:08:43,555 --> 00:08:44,956
A DATE.

145
00:08:44,989 --> 00:08:46,257
MY FIRST.

146
00:08:46,691 --> 00:08:48,993
HEY, CONGRATULATIONS.

147
00:08:49,027 --> 00:08:51,296
SO YOU FINALLY ASKED THAT ASHLEY GIRL OUT?

148
00:08:51,329 --> 00:08:53,398
WELL, NO.

149
00:08:53,431 --> 00:08:54,499
MANNY ASKED ME OUT.

150
00:08:54,532 --> 00:08:58,169
MANNY? ISN'T SHE A BIT YOUNG FOR YOU?

151
00:08:58,203 --> 00:08:59,571
IT'S JUST ELEVEN MONTHS, JOEY.

152
00:08:59,604 --> 00:09:00,505
SHE'S JUST ELEVEN MONTHS YOUNGER.

153
00:09:00,538 --> 00:09:03,241
ALRIGHT, AGE AIN'T NUTHIN' BUT A NUMBER.

154
00:09:03,274 --> 00:09:05,944
LOOK AT MR. MOO-MOO, CRAIG!

155
00:09:05,977 --> 00:09:08,246
MR. MOO-MOO, CRAIG!

156
00:09:08,279 --> 00:09:09,113
VERY NICE.

157
00:09:09,981 --> 00:09:11,616
SO SHE ASKED YOU OUT, HUH?

158
00:09:11,649 --> 00:09:13,685
CHECK OUT CRAIG - SUPER-STUD.

159
00:09:13,718 --> 00:09:15,620
TAKES AFTER HIS STEP-DAD.

160
00:09:15,653 --> 00:09:16,688
JUST BE BACK BY 10, OKAY? I'M SERIOUS.

161
00:09:16,721 --> 00:09:18,189
(Phone Ringing)

162
00:09:19,524 --> 00:09:20,725
HELLO?

163
00:09:20,758 --> 00:09:23,027
SO YOU KNOW WHAT TO SAY IF MY PARENTS CALL?

164
00:09:23,061 --> 00:09:24,095
MANNY, WE'VE BEEN THROUGH IT.

165
00:09:24,128 --> 00:09:25,230
AND WHAT IF YOUR MOM COMES HOME?

166
00:09:25,263 --> 00:09:29,567
SHE'S OUT TILL 11:00 WITH MR. SIMPSON, DON'T WORRY.

167
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:36,407
SO?

168
00:09:38,009 --> 00:09:40,345
CRAIG DOESN'T HAVE A CHANCE.

169
00:09:41,212 --> 00:09:42,180
I'M TRYING NOT TO FREAK

170
00:09:42,213 --> 00:09:45,483
BUT CRAIG'S THE FIRST BOY WHO'S EVER LIKED ME.

171
00:09:45,516 --> 00:09:48,519
AND HE WON'T BE THE LAST, OKAY?

172
00:09:48,553 --> 00:09:49,487
(Screaming)

173
00:09:50,655 --> 00:09:54,959
HE'S HERE! HE'S HERE! I'M GOING TO GO GET IT.

174
00:09:54,993 --> 00:09:57,061
HEY, I HEARD SCREAMING.

175
00:09:57,095 --> 00:09:59,497
THAT WAS THE TV.

176
00:10:02,567 --> 00:10:04,302
HE'S HERE, HE'S HERE...

177
00:10:06,204 --> 00:10:07,005
MANNY -

178
00:10:08,373 --> 00:10:10,041
YOU LOOK INCREDIBLE.

179
00:10:10,675 --> 00:10:11,542
YOU TOO.

180
00:10:13,044 --> 00:10:14,512
OH! I ALMOST FORGOT.

181
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:16,748
THIS IS FOR YOU.

182
00:10:16,781 --> 00:10:19,450
THAT'S JUST TOO PICTURE PERFECT.

183
00:10:24,088 --> 00:10:24,589
SMILE!

184
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:30,194
YOU READY FOR OUR DATE?

185
00:10:30,228 --> 00:10:31,396
I AM SO READY.

186
00:10:35,099 --> 00:10:36,534
SO? WHAT HAPPENED?

187
00:10:36,567 --> 00:10:38,636
AT FIRST, I WAS SO NERVOUS.

188
00:10:39,737 --> 00:10:41,673
BUT THEN I GOT INTO IT.

189
00:10:42,173 --> 00:10:43,641
AND BY THE END? I JUST KNEW.

190
00:10:43,675 --> 00:10:45,543
CRAIG WAS 'THE ONE'.

191
00:10:46,077 --> 00:10:47,645
SO YOU'RE GIRLFRIEND-BOYFRIEND NOW?

192
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:49,781
IT'S OFFICIAL? YOU TALKED TO CRAIG?

193
00:10:49,814 --> 00:10:53,751
NO. BUT I DON'T THINK I HAVE TO. I JUST KNOW.

194
00:10:54,485 --> 00:10:58,556
I GUESS THAT'S WHAT FALLING IN LOVE IS ALL ABOUT.

195
00:11:04,095 --> 00:11:04,963
CHECK OUT 'THE QUIET MAN'.

196
00:11:04,996 --> 00:11:07,465
YEAH, DUDE HASN'T SAID A WORD ALL DAY.

197
00:11:07,498 --> 00:11:10,668
SORRY. I UM, - I GOT A LOT ON MY MIND.

198
00:11:18,509 --> 00:11:19,510
I GET IT.

199
00:11:19,544 --> 00:11:22,547
CRAIG IS LOST IN LOVE WITH LITTLE MISS SANTOS.

200
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:25,316
MUST'VE BEEN A SERIOUSLY HOT DATE.

201
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:25,683
HOT?

202
00:11:26,751 --> 00:11:31,089
NO. I'D SAY THE BEST WAY TO DESCRIBE OUR DATE IS -

203
00:11:32,357 --> 00:11:33,024
BIZARRE.

204
00:11:34,158 --> 00:11:37,562
THE ONLY WAY TO DESCRIBE OUR DATE WAS -

205
00:11:37,595 --> 00:11:38,262
MAGICAL.

206
00:11:39,697 --> 00:11:42,667
I THOUGHT WE'D JUST GO TO THE MALL, SEE A MOVIE,

207
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:44,235
NOTHING SPECIAL.

208
00:11:45,536 --> 00:11:47,672
AND THEN WE GET THERE AND --

209
00:11:56,381 --> 00:11:58,282
OH MY GOSH, THE CARNIVAL IS ON!

210
00:11:58,316 --> 00:11:59,751
SO YOU DON'T WANT TO SEE THE MOVIE?

211
00:11:59,784 --> 00:12:01,386
AND MISS ALL THIS!

212
00:12:01,419 --> 00:12:04,722
I LOVE THE BALLOONS AND THE CLOWNS.

213
00:12:04,756 --> 00:12:05,490
OH, LOOK.

214
00:12:06,357 --> 00:12:09,360
AND COTTON CANDY? IT'S SO DELICIOUS.

215
00:12:09,794 --> 00:12:12,163
I KNOW. IT'S SO DELICIOUS.

216
00:12:14,298 --> 00:12:16,300
ONE COTTON CANDY PLEASE.

217
00:12:25,143 --> 00:12:27,145
NO! NO, IT'S FOR YOU.

218
00:12:27,178 --> 00:12:28,446
DON'T BE SILLY.

219
00:12:29,847 --> 00:12:32,283
THEN THE MOST INCREDIBLE THING HAPPENED.

220
00:12:32,316 --> 00:12:34,719
MY FINGERS BRUSHED HIS LIPS.

221
00:12:34,752 --> 00:12:37,422
I THOUGHT I WOULD DIE.

222
00:12:37,455 --> 00:12:40,391
MAYBE YOU CAN HELP FIGURE IT OUT.

223
00:12:40,425 --> 00:12:42,794
MANNY LOOKED SO AWESOME.

224
00:12:42,827 --> 00:12:45,296
AND I WAS HAPPY TO BE WITH HER.

225
00:12:46,264 --> 00:12:47,098
BUT THEN -

226
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:51,202
THE CARNIVAL IS ON!

227
00:12:51,235 --> 00:12:52,904
WAIT, SO YOU DON'T WANT TO SEE THE MOVIE?

228
00:12:52,937 --> 00:12:54,639
AND MISS ALL THIS?

229
00:12:55,239 --> 00:12:57,775
I LOVE BALLOONS AND THE CLOWNS.

230
00:12:59,577 --> 00:13:00,311
UH, LOOK.

231
00:13:03,681 --> 00:13:06,784
AND THE COTTON CANDY. YUMMY YUM YUM.

232
00:13:06,818 --> 00:13:08,453
YEAH, YEAH.

233
00:13:08,486 --> 00:13:09,654
YUMMY YUM YUM.

234
00:13:13,658 --> 00:13:15,693
NO, NO, NO. IT'S FOR YOU.

235
00:13:15,726 --> 00:13:17,195
DON'T BE SILLY.

236
00:13:20,765 --> 00:13:23,367
THE COTTON CANDY INCIDENT.

237
00:13:23,401 --> 00:13:26,337
SHE NEARLY CHOKED ME WITH IT.

238
00:13:26,904 --> 00:13:27,872
LOOK AT THE BRIGHT SIDE, DUDE.

239
00:13:27,905 --> 00:13:31,943
IF IT WAS A CANDY APPLE? YOU WOULD HAVE BE DEAD.

240
00:13:31,976 --> 00:13:33,411
YOU THINK THAT'S FUNNY?

241
00:13:33,444 --> 00:13:34,378
YEAH.

242
00:13:36,514 --> 00:13:38,749
YOU'RE GONNA LOVE THIS.

243
00:13:38,783 --> 00:13:40,818
WHOO! GO, CRAIG, GO.

244
00:13:40,852 --> 00:13:43,354
TODAY BALL TOSS. TOMORROW THE WORLD!

245
00:13:43,387 --> 00:13:44,722
YOU'RE LIKE, I DON'T KNOW -

246
00:13:44,755 --> 00:13:46,524
THE NEXT FAMOUS PITCHER GUY OR SOMETHING.

247
00:13:46,557 --> 00:13:47,725
THIS IS FOR YOU.

248
00:13:47,758 --> 00:13:49,694
OH, THIS IS THE BEST!

249
00:13:50,328 --> 00:13:51,529
IT'S SO CUTE.

250
00:13:51,562 --> 00:13:53,264
HIS NAME IS HORSEY-HORSE.

251
00:13:53,297 --> 00:13:57,235
I'VE ALREADY GOT PIGGY-PIG AND LAMBY-LAMB AND -

252
00:13:58,503 --> 00:14:00,738
YOU KNOW? THE FLUFFIE FLUFF COLLECTION?

253
00:14:00,771 --> 00:14:02,974
I THOUGHT SHE'D NEVER STOP TALKING.

254
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:06,444
THIS IS THE BEST GIFT. THANKS, CRAIG.

255
00:14:06,477 --> 00:14:08,679
AM I TALKING TOO MUCH?

256
00:14:08,713 --> 00:14:10,448
WHAT. NO, IT'S JUST -

257
00:14:11,816 --> 00:14:14,819
IT'S YOUR TURN TO WIN ME WHATEVER.

258
00:14:14,852 --> 00:14:17,855
JUST, DON'T THROW IT TOO HARD, OKAY?

259
00:14:20,391 --> 00:14:21,325
AAAHHHHHHH!

260
00:14:22,293 --> 00:14:22,927
OH, CRAIG.

261
00:14:23,828 --> 00:14:25,663
I AM SORRY I HURT YOU.

262
00:14:26,664 --> 00:14:27,865
DON'T, IT'S OKAY.

263
00:14:34,038 --> 00:14:34,872
THEN I LOOKED INTO HER EYES.

264
00:14:34,906 --> 00:14:37,909
AND I SAW HOW BEAUTIFUL SHE WAS.

265
00:14:39,777 --> 00:14:42,880
I MEAN, THE THING IS, I DO LIKE HER.

266
00:14:42,914 --> 00:14:45,449
IT'S JUST SHE'S A BIT YOUNG.

267
00:14:47,485 --> 00:14:49,220
ONLY BY A YEAR, DUDE.

268
00:14:49,787 --> 00:14:53,691
YOU WANNA KNOW THE REAL REASON I COULDN'T KISS HER?

269
00:14:53,724 --> 00:14:57,428
SHE REMINDS ME OF MY FIVE YEAR OLD HALF-SISTER.

270
00:14:57,461 --> 00:14:58,062
RIGHT.

271
00:14:58,095 --> 00:14:59,530
THAT'S, THAT'S MESSED UP.

272
00:14:59,564 --> 00:15:00,932
YEAH, THAT'S REALLY WEIRD.

273
00:15:00,965 --> 00:15:01,766
YEAH, DON'T SAY THAT.

274
00:15:01,799 --> 00:15:04,669
WELL, I KNOW. THAT'S THE PROBLEM.

275
00:15:05,336 --> 00:15:07,738
'CAUSE SHE'S ALSO REALLY SWEET.

276
00:15:08,306 --> 00:15:09,640
SO WHAT DO I DO?

277
00:15:15,046 --> 00:15:17,748
I CAN'T BELIEVE HE BOUGHT YOU A ROSE.

278
00:15:17,782 --> 00:15:19,850
CRAIG IS A TRUE ROMANTIC.

279
00:15:21,352 --> 00:15:24,522
I JUST WISH OUR DATE HAD ENDED BETTER.

280
00:15:25,523 --> 00:15:26,924
WHY? WHAT HAPPENED?

281
00:15:27,725 --> 00:15:29,927
MORE LIKE WHAT DIDN'T HAPPEN.

282
00:15:33,331 --> 00:15:33,965
TODAY BALL-TOSS, TOMORROW THE WORLD!

283
00:15:33,998 --> 00:15:35,032
THIS IS FOR YOU.

284
00:15:35,066 --> 00:15:36,801
OH, THIS IS THE BEST.

285
00:15:37,668 --> 00:15:40,071
MY FAVOURITE THING, 'CAUSE YOU WON IT.

286
00:15:40,104 --> 00:15:41,472
THANKS, CRAIG.

287
00:15:43,975 --> 00:15:45,776
AM I TALKING TOO MUCH?

288
00:15:45,810 --> 00:15:47,845
NOT AT ALL. IT'S YOUR TURN.

289
00:15:47,878 --> 00:15:50,948
JUST TRY NOT TO THROW TOO HARD, OKAY?

290
00:15:51,849 --> 00:15:52,049
OKAY.

291
00:15:56,854 --> 00:15:58,589
OH DEAR! THAT SMARTS.

292
00:16:01,092 --> 00:16:01,692
OH, CRAIG, I AM SO SORRY I HURT YOU.

293
00:16:01,726 --> 00:16:03,961
NO, IT'S OKAY, IT'S OKAY.

294
00:16:05,129 --> 00:16:07,865
I'M REALLY, REALLY, REALLY SORRY.

295
00:16:20,678 --> 00:16:21,479
MANNY -

296
00:16:23,948 --> 00:16:25,783
I SHOULD GET YOU HOME.

297
00:16:26,651 --> 00:16:27,718
I'LL BET HE WANTED TO.

298
00:16:27,752 --> 00:16:29,654
HE JUST WANTED TO GET YOU BACK TO MY HOUSE ON TIME.

299
00:16:29,687 --> 00:16:31,689
WHICH I THINK IS COOL.

300
00:16:31,722 --> 00:16:32,556
ABSOLUTELY.

301
00:16:32,590 --> 00:16:34,058
CRAIG HAS MY TWO FAVOURITE QUALITIES:

302
00:16:34,091 --> 00:16:36,594
PASSION AND PUNCTUALITY.

303
00:16:36,627 --> 00:16:38,562
THAT'S WHY HE'S MY GUY.

304
00:16:41,732 --> 00:16:43,901
OKAY, THAT WAS A GOOD ANALYSIS OF PRINT ADS, EVERYONE.

305
00:16:43,934 --> 00:16:45,870
YOU'RE GETTING THE HANG OF READING

306
00:16:45,903 --> 00:16:47,772
THE UNDERLYING SALES MESSAGE.

307
00:16:47,805 --> 00:16:49,707
SO, LET'S MOVE ON TO TV. COMMERCIALS.

308
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:51,776
MOST OF US MAY SEE THEM AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO GET A SNACK,

309
00:16:51,809 --> 00:16:54,912
BUT TV ADVERTISING CAN REAP HUGE PROFITS.

310
00:16:54,945 --> 00:16:56,080
NOW TAPE THREE COMMERCIALS -

311
00:16:56,113 --> 00:16:57,415
ONE FOR LAUNDRY DETERGENT,

312
00:16:57,448 --> 00:16:58,883
ONE FOR THE LATEST LUXURY VEHICLE,

313
00:16:58,916 --> 00:17:00,985
AND THE LAST FOR ATHLETIC SHOES.

314
00:17:01,018 --> 00:17:03,387
WHILE YOU'RE WATCHING PAY SPECIAL ATTENTION TO THE IMAGES

315
00:17:03,421 --> 00:17:06,057
HOW THEY'VE BEEN SHOT, EDITED...

316
00:17:07,525 --> 00:17:09,527
MANNY...

317
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:10,728
HEY YOU! WHERE YOU BEEN?

318
00:17:10,761 --> 00:17:13,464
DID YOU MISS ME? I MISSED YOU.

319
00:17:13,998 --> 00:17:15,066
EVERYBODY'S TALKING ABOUT US.

320
00:17:15,099 --> 00:17:18,703
YEAH, THEY SAY WE'RE DEGRASSI'S HOTTEST NEW COUPLE.

321
00:17:18,736 --> 00:17:18,936
YEAH.

322
00:17:20,738 --> 00:17:21,372
I'M EMBARRASSED, TOO.

323
00:17:21,405 --> 00:17:23,441
PEOPLE TALKING LIKE THIS.

324
00:17:23,474 --> 00:17:25,609
BUT I HAD SUCH AN AMAZING TIME.

325
00:17:25,643 --> 00:17:26,577
THE CARNIVAL, THE GIFT.

326
00:17:26,610 --> 00:17:29,513
IT WAS, LIKE - THE BEST NIGHT OF MY LIFE.

327
00:17:29,547 --> 00:17:31,749
AND ALL BECAUSE OF YOU.

328
00:17:32,616 --> 00:17:32,917
GREAT.

329
00:17:35,886 --> 00:17:37,421
WELL, I'LL SEE YOU LATER?

330
00:17:37,455 --> 00:17:38,389
GREAT. BYE.

331
00:17:44,695 --> 00:17:45,896
THAT WAS - WEIRD.

332
00:17:47,798 --> 00:17:49,767
MAYBE CRAIG'S NOT REALLY INTO THIS.

333
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:51,802
NO, NO. HE'S JUST MOODY.

334
00:17:52,636 --> 00:17:54,038
MAYBE YOU SHOULD SLOW DOWN?

335
00:17:54,071 --> 00:17:56,640
YOU KNOW, BEFORE YOU GET HURT.

336
00:17:56,674 --> 00:17:58,809
NO. HE NEEDS IS CHEERING UP.

337
00:17:59,877 --> 00:18:01,479
WHICH I'M GREAT AT!

338
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:16,594
HEY.

339
00:18:17,561 --> 00:18:19,029
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

340
00:18:19,063 --> 00:18:20,998
NOTHING.

341
00:18:21,031 --> 00:18:22,700
BECAUSE I WAS SUPPOSED TO MEET HAZEL AND...

342
00:18:22,733 --> 00:18:23,534
I KNOW.

343
00:18:25,669 --> 00:18:26,504
YEAH?

344
00:18:26,537 --> 00:18:29,440
I KIND OF KNOW FIRST-HAND, ACTUALLY.

345
00:18:32,810 --> 00:18:35,880
EL, HAVE YOU BEEN THE ONE WRITING ME?

346
00:18:41,218 --> 00:18:41,685
EL?

347
00:18:47,725 --> 00:18:48,726
(Cell Phone)

348
00:18:54,632 --> 00:18:54,932
HELLO?

349
00:18:55,966 --> 00:18:57,835
ELLIE.

350
00:18:59,003 --> 00:19:00,938
I HOPE YOU'RE CALLING TO TELL ME ABOUT YOUR SUDDEN CASE

351
00:19:00,971 --> 00:19:01,906
OF AMNESIA.

352
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:04,542
NO.

353
00:19:04,842 --> 00:19:06,777
I WISH I HAD AMNESIA.

354
00:19:07,144 --> 00:19:09,747
DON'T TAKE REJECTION WELL.

355
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:11,849
ELLIE. TURN AROUND.

356
00:19:20,124 --> 00:19:21,992
I DIDN'T REJECT YOU.

357
00:19:22,693 --> 00:19:23,994
FELT LIKE IT.

358
00:19:24,028 --> 00:19:26,197
WELL OF COURSE IT DID. YOU DIDN'T LET ME FINISH.

359
00:19:26,230 --> 00:19:27,131
BUT YOU WERE -

360
00:19:27,164 --> 00:19:29,900
I WAS GONNA MEET HAZEL TO TELL HER THAT -

361
00:19:29,934 --> 00:19:32,703
WELL, TO TELL HER THAT SHE'S NOT MY TYPE.

362
00:19:32,736 --> 00:19:35,673
I MEAN, I GO FOR COOL, ALTERNATIVE...

363
00:19:37,174 --> 00:19:39,009
GIRLS LIKE ELLIE NASH.

364
00:19:41,645 --> 00:19:41,912
OH.

365
00:19:43,581 --> 00:19:44,882
I'M SUCH AN IDIOT.

366
00:19:45,683 --> 00:19:45,950
NO.

367
00:19:46,817 --> 00:19:50,254
IF YOU WERE, WOULD I STILL ASK YOU OUT?

368
00:19:52,790 --> 00:19:53,924
FOR C,

369
00:19:53,958 --> 00:19:55,025
AS IN COFFEE?

370
00:20:06,337 --> 00:20:07,671
HOW WAS PHOTOGRAPHY CLUB?

371
00:20:07,705 --> 00:20:08,639
FINE.

372
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:11,775
WHAT HAPPENED TO MY LOCKER?

373
00:20:11,809 --> 00:20:15,646
I THOUGHT IT MIGHT CHEER YOU UP.

374
00:20:18,682 --> 00:20:20,851
I, UH, HOPE I'M NOT INTERRUPTING.

375
00:20:21,986 --> 00:20:24,021
YOU SAID YOU WANTED TO SIGN THIS?

376
00:20:24,054 --> 00:20:27,892
YEAH, THIS IS THE PETITION PROTESTING GM FOODS, RIGHT?

377
00:20:28,692 --> 00:20:29,226
GM FOODS?

378
00:20:30,027 --> 00:20:32,630
STANDS FOR GENETICALLY MODIFIED.

379
00:20:32,663 --> 00:20:33,597
DOES THAT -

380
00:20:34,298 --> 00:20:35,766
MAKE THEM GOOD?

381
00:20:42,373 --> 00:20:44,742
I'LL SEE YOU LATER, CRAIG.

382
00:20:48,279 --> 00:20:51,682
I DON'T THINK YOU SHOULD TALK TO HER ANYMORE.

383
00:20:51,715 --> 00:20:53,350
UH, SHE'S IN MY CLASS.

384
00:20:56,820 --> 00:20:59,757
SO - WHAT'RE WE DOING FRIDAY NIGHT?

385
00:21:05,262 --> 00:21:06,864
YOU'RE MOODY AGAIN.

386
00:21:07,698 --> 00:21:09,166
IS IT YOUR LOCKER?

387
00:21:09,199 --> 00:21:11,302
YOU DON'T LIKE IT?

388
00:21:11,335 --> 00:21:12,169
NO, MANNY.

389
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:15,973
I'M SORRY -

390
00:21:17,708 --> 00:21:20,711
BUT IT'S NOT MY LOCKER I DON'T LIKE.

391
00:21:23,147 --> 00:21:23,981
IT'S YOU.
