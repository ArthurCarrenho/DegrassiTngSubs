1
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:05,001
SO I TURN IT OVER,

2
00:00:05,034 --> 00:00:07,670
AND I'M SURE I STUDIED THE WRONG STUFF.

3
00:00:07,703 --> 00:00:08,638
I KNOW THE FEELING.

4
00:00:08,671 --> 00:00:11,073
BUT THE EXAM I'M REALLY DREADING? SCIENCE.

5
00:00:11,107 --> 00:00:11,907
TELL ME ABOUT IT.

6
00:00:11,941 --> 00:00:13,843
SCIENCE IS TOTALLY MY WORST SUBJECT.

7
00:00:13,876 --> 00:00:17,747
MAYBE YOU NEED HELP FROM YOUR OLD SCIENCE STUDY PARTNER?

8
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:17,913
DAD?

9
00:00:21,617 --> 00:00:22,918
WHAT ARE YOU - WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

10
00:00:22,952 --> 00:00:25,087
I JUST THOUGHT I'D COME BY AND SEE MY SON.

11
00:00:25,121 --> 00:00:26,656
MEET HIS FRIENDS.

12
00:00:26,689 --> 00:00:28,024

00:00:28,057 --> 00:00:30,826
HI ASHLEY. NICE TO MEET YOU.

14
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:31,527
AND YOU?

15
00:00:37,566 --> 00:00:39,368
CAN I GIVE YOU A LIFT HOME?

16
00:00:39,402 --> 00:00:41,003
I LIVE WITH JOEY NOW.

17
00:00:41,037 --> 00:00:43,773
TO JOEY'S. WE CAN CATCH UP ON THE WAY.

18
00:00:43,806 --> 00:00:44,807
UM, I CAN'T.

19
00:00:47,143 --> 00:00:47,743
OKAY.

20
00:00:48,978 --> 00:00:50,813
I DON'T KNOW - MAYBE WE COULD HAVE DINNER TOMORROW NIGHT?

21
00:00:50,846 --> 00:00:52,048
YOU COULD COME BY WORK?

22
00:00:52,081 --> 00:00:52,682

00:01:01,557 --> 00:01:04,827
YEAH, WELL, HE DIDN'T HAVE A BELT IN HIS HAND.

27
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:06,595
YOU'RE NOT ACTUALLY GOING TO GO, ARE YOU?

00:01:11,934 --> 00:01:13,869

29
00:01:15,705 --> 00:01:18,541

TELL ME AGAIN

00:01:59,615 --> 00:02:00,850
WHY I NEED TO KNOW ABOUT GENETICS?

40
00:02:00,883 --> 00:02:04,520
SO YOU CAN CLONE ME, AND I CAN BE IN A MILLION PLACES AT ONCE.

41
00:02:04,553 --> 00:02:05,721
I'VE GOT TO TAKE ANG TO BALLET TONIGHT-

42
00:02:05,755 --> 00:02:08,791
DINNER'S IN THE FREEZER. YOU TWO'LL BE HOME LATE. I KNOW.

43
00:02:08,824 --> 00:02:10,126
IF I'M HOME.

44
00:02:10,793 --> 00:02:12,728
ANG, SWEETIE, FINISH YOUR CEREAL. COME ON.

45
00:02:12,762 --> 00:02:13,929

00:02:13,963 --> 00:02:16,999
OH, OKAY. WELL HAVE SOME ORANGE JUICE THEN, OKAY? COME ON.

47
00:02:17,032 --> 00:02:17,566

48
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,835
ANGELA, CAREFUL! MAN!

49
00:02:19,869 --> 00:02:23,139
OKAY NO, NO, HONEY. IT'S OKAY, DADDY'S NOT MAD. IT'S OKAY.

50
00:02:23,172 --> 00:02:24,840
IS THE BOOK A GONER?

51
00:02:24,874 --> 00:02:26,609
NO, IT'LL BE OKAY.

52
00:02:26,642 --> 00:02:27,409
WHAT A MESS!

53
00:02:27,443 --> 00:02:28,511
YEAH, THIS WHOLE PLACE IS A MESS.

54
00:02:28,544 --> 00:02:30,713
WELL THEN WHY DON'T YOU EARN YOUR ALLOWANCE TODAY,

00:02:30,746 --> 00:02:34,617

SWEETIE, COME ON, IT'S OKAY. IT'S OKAY.

OKAY, DOES ANYONE HAVE ANY QUESTIONS?

YEAH. WHAT I STILL DON'T GET

61
00:02:52,301 --> 00:02:55,237
IS WHAT MAKES AN ELEMENT A NOBLE GAS.

62
00:02:55,271 --> 00:02:56,338
NOBLE GASES ARE STABLE.

63
00:02:56,372 --> 00:02:58,707
BECAUSE THEY HAVE THE MAXIMUM NUMBER OF ELECTRONS

64
00:02:58,741 --> 00:02:59,775
IN THEIR OUTER SHELL,

65
00:02:59,809 --> 00:03:01,977
THEY DON'T FORM COMPOUNDS VERY EASILY. OKAY?

66
00:03:02,011 --> 00:03:03,179
RIGHT, THANKS.

67
00:03:06,649 --> 00:03:09,051
OH, SUMMER WITHOUT HATZILAKOS.

68
00:03:09,084 --> 00:03:10,219
I'M TRYING TO CONCENTRATE, OKAY?

69
00:03:10,252 --> 00:03:12,021

70
00:03:12,054 --> 00:03:12,988
SO SHUT UP!

71
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:16,792
OH, SOMEONE'S A BROWNER.

72
00:03:17,593 --> 00:03:19,228
SOMEONE IS JUST IN A BAD MOOD.

73
00:03:19,261 --> 00:03:22,665
SOMEONE JUST WANTS TO PASS HIS SCIENCE EXAM, ALL RIGHT?

74
00:03:22,698 --> 00:03:24,266
ALL RIGHT, DUDE.

75
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:25,901
IS EVERYTHING OKAY?

76
00:03:26,702 --> 00:03:26,902
YEAH.

77
00:03:28,237 --> 00:03:30,239
THE STRESS OF THE EXAMS?

78
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:33,309
YEAH, I WISH THAT WAS IT.

79
00:03:33,342 --> 00:03:35,010
HMPH. YOUR DAD, HUH?

80
00:03:35,945 --> 00:03:37,880

81
00:03:37,913 --> 00:03:38,514
UH, NO.

82
00:03:40,583 --> 00:03:40,883
SORRY.

83
00:03:43,085 --> 00:03:47,156
WE TALK ON THE PHONE ONCE IN AWHILE, BUT YESTERDAY?

84
00:03:47,189 --> 00:03:49,758
IT'S THE FIRST TIME I'VE SEEN HIM IN MONTHS.

85
00:03:49,792 --> 00:03:51,293
PEOPLE CAN CHANGE.

86
00:03:52,361 --> 00:03:53,028
I GUESS.

87
00:04:05,007 --> 00:04:05,608

SO DO YOU WANT MY TUTORING HELP OR NOT?

93
00:04:45,915 --> 00:04:46,982
UH, YES I DO.

94
00:04:48,817 --> 00:04:50,986
WILL YOU HELP ME, LIBERTY?

95
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:51,820
PLEASE?

96
00:04:53,289 --> 00:04:54,657
PRETTY PLEASE?

00:05:07,736 --> 00:05:09,004
THAT'S THE PRICE YOU'LL PAY.

103

00:05:10,306 --> 00:05:13,842

00:06:15,137 --> 00:06:16,839
NO. A SURPRISE VISIT.

127
00:06:16,872 --> 00:06:18,407
WELL, IT'LL DO YOUR FATHER GOOD.

128
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:23,045
THAT'S THE FIRST SMILE I'VE SEEN ON HIM SINCE YOU LEFT.

I MEAN, YOUR MARKS ARE SO IMPORTANT.

146
00:07:11,493 --> 00:07:13,962
YEAH, NO, IT'S UNDER CONTROL. REALLY.

WELL IF YOU NEED HELP WITH ANYTHING, YOU LET ME KNOW.

00:07:18,333 --> 00:07:20,235
I'D HAVE TO ASK JOEY.

149
00:07:20,269 --> 00:07:21,336
ESPECIALLY SCIENCE.

150
00:07:21,370 --> 00:07:23,405
IS THAT STILL YOUR WORST SUBJECT?

151
00:07:23,439 --> 00:07:26,041
YEAH. SOME THINGS NEVER CHANGE.

152
00:07:27,976 --> 00:07:29,778

154
00:07:37,119 --> 00:07:39,288
YOU DO HAVE A FEVER, BABY.

WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN, CRAIG?

156
00:07:43,158 --> 00:07:45,027
I THOUGHT YOU'D BE HOME A LONG TIME AGO.

157
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:46,395
I GOT CAUGHT UP STUDYING.

158
00:07:46,428 --> 00:07:47,362
ANG GOT SICK AT BALLET TONIGHT.

00:07:47,396 --> 00:07:50,399
I COME HOME, THIS PLACE IS STILL A DISASTER.

160
00:07:50,432 --> 00:07:51,266
I'M SORRY.

161
00:07:52,134 --> 00:07:55,204

WHAT ABOUT MY DREAM? PAIGE, DANCING WITH ME?

184
00:09:33,602 --> 00:09:35,304
SO CLOSE, SO SLOW.

185
00:09:36,104 --> 00:09:37,272
SO IMPOSSIBLE.

186
00:09:39,408 --> 00:09:41,343
WELL, I COULD STILL ASK HER OUT.

187
00:09:41,376 --> 00:09:42,544
YOU CAN'T USE LIBERTY TO PASS,

188
00:09:42,578 --> 00:09:45,647
THEN DUMP HER AND GO WITH PAIGE, ROMEO.

189
00:09:46,348 --> 00:09:48,917
OH, FLASH CARDS. QUEL SURPRISE.

190
00:09:48,951 --> 00:09:51,119

MINSK. HELLO?

00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:07,569
DO YOU PREFER CHARTREUSE OR FUCHSIA?

196
00:10:07,603 --> 00:10:10,138
I CAN'T DECIDE ON MY GOWN FOR THIS DANCE.

197
00:10:10,172 --> 00:10:12,674
LIBERTY, IT'S A LUAU, OKAY?

198
00:10:12,708 --> 00:10:15,310
YOU DON'T NEED SOME BIG GOWN.

199
00:10:16,178 --> 00:10:17,112
I MEAN, IT'S NOT EVEN A -

200
00:10:17,145 --> 00:10:19,047
I KNOW, IT'S NOT A REAL DATE.

201
00:10:19,081 --> 00:10:21,917
BUT, I JUST WANT SOMETHING YOU'LL LIKE.

202
00:10:23,118 --> 00:10:24,453
OKAY. MOVING ON.

00:10:47,042 --> 00:10:49,611

I'M THRILLED FOR YOU, SWEET POTATO.

216
00:11:47,636 --> 00:11:51,506
UH, YEAH. AND YOU KNOW? YOU CAN MAKE IT EVEN BETTER.

217
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:55,477
BY ANSWERING ONE LITTLE QUESTION. THE DANCE -

218
00:11:56,845 --> 00:11:58,647
JT!

219
00:12:00,582 --> 00:12:01,183
YOU FINISHED BEFORE ME.

00:12:18,133 --> 00:12:20,802
YEAH. THE HAWAIIAN SURF PARADISE.

225
00:12:20,836 --> 00:12:23,672
HEATHER SINCLAIR'S TITLE, NOT MINE.

226
00:12:23,705 --> 00:12:25,774
WHATEVER. DO YOU WANT TO -?

227
00:12:29,411 --> 00:12:30,145
YOU KNOW?

228
00:12:33,548 --> 00:12:36,785
DO YOU WANT TO HELP LIBERTY PICK OUT AN OUTFIT?

229
00:12:36,818 --> 00:12:38,186
SHE'S MY DATE.

230
00:12:39,187 --> 00:12:40,522
UM, I'D LOVE TO.

231
00:12:42,657 --> 00:12:44,426

00:12:49,264 --> 00:12:49,664
THANKS.

234
00:12:51,233 --> 00:12:53,835
YEAH, ASK YOU, PAIGE. YES, THAT'S FUNNY.

00:12:53,869 --> 00:12:56,571
FREE FROM SCIENCE FOR TWO MONTHS!

236
00:12:56,605 --> 00:12:58,807
AND I'M SURE OUR KNOWLEDGE OF THE PERIODIC TABLE

237
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:00,642
WILL COME IN HANDY.

238
00:13:01,576 --> 00:13:04,279
SO. YEAR-END DANCE. YOU GOING?

239
00:13:04,646 --> 00:13:07,649
UH, I'M ON THE COMMITTEE, REMEMBER?

240
00:13:07,682 --> 00:13:09,851
NO, I MEANT - WITH ANYONE?

241
00:13:10,585 --> 00:13:11,186
OH. NO.

242
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:12,854
ME NEITHER.

243
00:13:16,425 --> 00:13:18,260
SHOULD WE GO TOGETHER?

244
00:13:18,293 --> 00:13:19,628
YEAH, WE SHOULD.

245
00:13:22,264 --> 00:13:24,566
DAD, WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

246
00:13:24,599 --> 00:13:27,602
I JUST WANTED TO SEE HOW YOU DID ON THE EXAM.

00:13:33,742 --> 00:13:36,711
I SHOULD GO. NICE TO SEE YOU, DR. MANNING.

NICE TO SEE YOU TOO, ALISON.

250
00:13:39,448 --> 00:13:40,449
IT'S ASHLEY.

251
00:13:45,887 --> 00:13:47,322
INTERESTING GIRL.

252
00:13:47,355 --> 00:13:47,756
SHE IS.

253
00:13:48,757 --> 00:13:50,692
SO, DINNER TONIGHT?

254
00:13:50,725 --> 00:13:52,194

00:13:56,264 --> 00:13:59,734
I'LL MEET YOU AT THE BISTRO AT EIGHT-THIRTY.

258
00:14:02,737 --> 00:14:03,238

00:14:07,342 --> 00:14:09,177
OKAY, SEE YOU TONIGHT.

261
00:14:11,947 --> 00:14:14,683
AGAIN! READ IT AGAIN.

262
00:14:14,716 --> 00:14:17,953
ANG, I'VE READ IT FIVE TIMES ALREADY. I COULD RECITE IT.

263
00:14:17,986 --> 00:14:21,189
CRAIG! PLEASE? I'VE GOT THE CHICKEN POX.

264
00:14:22,357 --> 00:14:24,659
FINE. YOUR WISH IS MY COMMAND.

265
00:14:25,694 --> 00:14:27,162
(Phone Ringing)

266
00:14:27,762 --> 00:14:30,765
HERE, COUNT HOW MANY SPOTS YOU HAVE.

267
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:32,701
HELLO?

268
00:14:33,535 --> 00:14:35,370
JOEY, YOU'RE LATE.

269
00:14:35,403 --> 00:14:36,271
YEAH, I KNOW IT'S LATE, CRAIG.

270
00:14:36,304 --> 00:14:38,206
BUT I GOT A POTENTIAL SALE HERE, OKAY?

271
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:40,208
I'M GOING TO BE AT LEAST ANOTHER HOUR.

272
00:14:40,242 --> 00:14:42,511
I HAVE PLANS... WITH FRIENDS.

273
00:14:42,978 --> 00:14:45,213
YOU CAN'T GET HOME SOONER?

274
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:47,883
IF YOU WANT ME TO LOSE THE SALE, YEAH.

275
00:14:47,916 --> 00:14:49,751
NO, THAT'S FINE. FINE.

276
00:14:50,919 --> 00:14:53,455
OKAY. I'LL SEE YOU IN A BIT.

277
00:14:54,990 --> 00:14:57,359
SEVENTEEN, EIGHTEEN SPOTS.

278

00:15:06,701 --> 00:15:09,504

FOR THE TENTH TIME, I'M WAITING FOR SOMEONE. OKAY?

281
00:15:26,454 --> 00:15:28,757
DAD, DAD, I'M SORRY. UH, JOEY GOT HELD UP.

282
00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:29,958
JUST SIT, SIT.

283
00:15:36,464 --> 00:15:38,733
I GOT YOU A LITTLE PRESENT.

284
00:15:43,672 --> 00:15:44,639
TICKETS TO LONDON?

285
00:15:44,673 --> 00:15:47,375
WE'LL START THERE, TAKE THE CHUNNEL TO PARIS,

286
00:15:47,409 --> 00:15:48,843
RENT A CAR FOR A COUPLE OF WEEKS.

287
00:15:48,877 --> 00:15:51,413
DAD! THAT'S AWESOME. REALLY?

288
00:15:52,514 --> 00:15:55,684
THIS IS THE PERFECT OPPORTUNITY FOR YOU AND I TO ACCLIMATIZE.

289
00:15:55,717 --> 00:15:58,587
YOU KNOW? BEFORE SCHOOL STARTS.

290
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:00,021
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

291
00:16:00,822 --> 00:16:02,390
IT'S TIME FOR YOU TO COME HOME, CRAIG.

292
00:16:02,424 --> 00:16:04,826
I MEAN, JOEY'S WAS - NECESSARY.

293
00:16:05,794 --> 00:16:08,630
BUT IT'S NOT THE BEST ENVIRONMENT.

294
00:16:09,731 --> 00:16:11,933
UM - BUT I LIKE IT AT JOEY'S.

295
00:16:13,068 --> 00:16:14,836
OF COURSE YOU DO, WITH ANGELA THERE.

296
00:16:14,869 --> 00:16:19,341
BUT LOOK AT YOUR STUDY SITUATION. IT IS NOT STABLE.

297
00:16:22,711 --> 00:16:24,913
BEING AT JOEY'S IS STABILITY.

298
00:16:27,415 --> 00:16:28,049
DAD.

299
00:16:36,691 --> 00:16:37,525
YOU KNOW -

300
00:16:40,028 --> 00:16:40,562
DAD!

301
00:16:50,772 --> 00:16:52,073
DAD! DAD, WAIT UP!

302
00:16:53,775 --> 00:16:56,511
ARE YOU TALKING TO ME OR ARE YOU TALKING TO JOEY?

303
00:16:56,544 --> 00:16:57,746
OH, THAT'S NOT FAIR.

304
00:16:57,779 --> 00:17:01,416
LIFE'S NOT FAIR. AND YOU'RE RIGHT - JOEY IS BETTER FOR YOU.

305
00:17:01,449 --> 00:17:03,685
THIS WAY YOU CAN KISS YOUR POTENTIAL GOOD-BYE,

306
00:17:03,718 --> 00:17:05,820
SETTLE FOR SOME "INTERESTING" LITTLE GOTH GIRL -

307
00:17:05,854 --> 00:17:06,588
DON'T TALK ABOUT ASHLEY LIKE THAT -

308
00:17:06,621 --> 00:17:08,390
YOUR MARKS CAN DROP,

309
00:17:08,423 --> 00:17:10,025
AND ONE DAY YOU CAN TAKE OVER THE CAR LOT.

310
00:17:10,058 --> 00:17:10,592
UGH!

311
00:17:11,393 --> 00:17:11,726
ARR!

312
00:17:21,603 --> 00:17:23,605
CRAIG, I'M SO SORRY. IT'LL -

313
00:17:23,638 --> 00:17:25,707
IT'LL NEVER HAPPEN AGAIN?

314
00:17:26,007 --> 00:17:26,841
HUH?

315
00:17:29,577 --> 00:17:31,579
IS THAT WHAT YOU WERE GONNA SAY?

316
00:17:31,613 --> 00:17:34,549
'CAUSE THAT'S WHAT YOU ALWAYS SAY.

317
00:17:34,582 --> 00:17:36,718
BECAUSE YOU ALWAYS SCREW UP.

318
00:17:37,786 --> 00:17:41,556
NO, DAD - YOU'RE THE ONE WHO SCREWS UP.

319
00:17:41,589 --> 00:17:43,425
IT WON'T CHANGE. EVER!

320
00:18:03,011 --> 00:18:05,413
HEY CRAIG, YOU'RE HOME EARLY.

321
00:18:05,447 --> 00:18:08,817
HEY. YEAH. UH, DON'T WANT TO WEAR OUT THE SUMMER TOO FAST.

322
00:18:08,850 --> 00:18:10,385
SOMETHING WRONG?

323
00:18:17,726 --> 00:18:18,927
I GOT IN A FIGHT.

324
00:18:19,794 --> 00:18:20,729
WITH WHO?

325
00:18:22,897 --> 00:18:23,698
MY DAD.

326
00:18:25,066 --> 00:18:28,603
YOUR DAD? YOU SAW YOUR DAD? WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME?

327
00:18:28,636 --> 00:18:29,838
WELL, 'CAUSE YOU WOULDN'T HAVE LET ME.

328
00:18:29,871 --> 00:18:32,741
YOU'RE RIGHT I WOULDN'T HAVE LET YOU, CRAIG.

329
00:18:32,774 --> 00:18:34,642
I'M GOING TO CALL THE POLICE.

330
00:18:34,676 --> 00:18:36,077
NO.

331
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:41,449
TOMORROW? I WANT US TO GO TO CHILDREN'S AID -

332
00:18:41,483 --> 00:18:45,787
AND I WANT TO MAKE SURE I NEVER HAVE TO SEE HIM AGAIN.

333
00:18:47,489 --> 00:18:47,689
OKAY.

334
00:18:50,725 --> 00:18:53,128
I HATE HIM, JOEY.

335
00:18:55,764 --> 00:18:57,565
I HATE HIM SO MUCH.

336
00:19:03,905 --> 00:19:07,609
WE'LL TALK MORE ABOUT THIS IN THE MORNING.

337
00:19:08,710 --> 00:19:10,912
WHY DON'T YOU CLEAN UP?

338
00:19:22,991 --> 00:19:23,625
GOOD MORNING.

339
00:19:23,658 --> 00:19:25,560
HEY. MORNING.

340
00:19:25,593 --> 00:19:27,862
SO YOU GUYS WANT ME TO ADD ANYTHING TO THIS GROCERY LIST?

341
00:19:27,896 --> 00:19:30,565
YEAH, A STEAK FOR MY EYE.

342
00:19:30,598 --> 00:19:34,002
OR MAYBE JUST A PATCH. SORTA LIKE A PIRATE, HUH ANG?

343
00:19:34,035 --> 00:19:34,736
ARRR!

344
00:19:34,769 --> 00:19:35,703
ARRR!

345
00:19:38,139 --> 00:19:40,809
SO, UH, YOU'RE REALLY GOING TO DO THIS?

346
00:19:40,842 --> 00:19:42,510
THE CHILDREN'S AID THING?

347
00:19:42,544 --> 00:19:43,178
YES.

348
00:19:43,978 --> 00:19:45,713
THIS IS WHERE I NEED TO BE FOR GOOD.

349
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:46,981
(Doorbell & Knocking)

350
00:19:49,617 --> 00:19:50,885
WHAT IF THAT'S HIM?

351
00:19:50,919 --> 00:19:53,588
YOUR DAD? I DOUBT IT.

352
00:19:53,621 --> 00:19:56,791
CRAIG. YESTERDAY I HAD EIGHTEEN SPOTS.

353
00:19:57,792 --> 00:20:00,728

354
00:20:02,831 --> 00:20:05,033

00:20:16,277 --> 00:20:19,113
OH, WAIT! FOURTEEN, FIFTEEN SPOTS!

358
00:20:25,787 --> 00:20:28,623
ANGELA, CAN YOU GO UPSTAIRS AND CLEAN YOUR ROOM, PLEASE?

359
00:20:28,656 --> 00:20:29,991
DO I HAVE TO?

360
00:20:30,024 --> 00:20:31,025
YES, PLEASE.

361
00:20:32,126 --> 00:20:36,164
SO - MY DAD SENT THE POLICE TO COME GET ME. WHAT?

362
00:20:39,634 --> 00:20:41,035
HAVE A SEAT, CRAIG.

OKAY.

I DON'T KNOW HOW TO TELL YOU THIS -

365
00:20:53,381 --> 00:20:54,115
WHAT?

369
00:21:13,868 --> 00:21:15,169
