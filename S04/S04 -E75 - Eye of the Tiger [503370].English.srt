00:02:21,558 --> 00:02:22,518
INSTEAD OF AT THE HOSPITAL

42
00:02:22,601 --> 00:02:25,479

80
00:03:57,779 --> 00:03:59,489
I HAVE AN IDEA.

81

YOUR LIPS TASTE
LIKE SWEET JELLY.

82
00:04:07,497 --> 00:04:10,334
HEY LIBERTY,
HOW'S YOUR MONO?

83
00:04:10,417 --> 00:04:11,001
LIBERTY:
BRAVO, DANIEL.

84
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:13,420
YOU'VE DISCOVERED
HUMOUR.

85
00:04:13,504 --> 00:04:14,254
SO JT,

86
00:04:14,338 --> 00:04:15,172
THE BOARDING PARK
AWAITS.

87
00:04:16,006 --> 00:04:17,007
AS DOES
THE HOT TUB.

88
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:19,051
A PERFECT
105 FAHRENHEIT,

89
00:04:19,134 --> 00:04:21,136
40.56 DEGREES CELSIUS.

90
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:21,887
JUST CHECKED.

91
00:04:22,721 --> 00:04:24,765
DID YOU CHECK
THE CHLORINE LEVEL?

92
00:04:24,848 --> 00:04:26,517
IT'S BROMINE,
MY LITTLE ROTWEILER.

93
00:04:27,726 --> 00:04:28,810
STILL NOT STRONG
ENOUGH TO KILL

94
00:04:28,894 --> 00:04:30,771
WHATEVER FUNGUS
IS GROWING ON YOU.

95
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:32,648
KNOW WHAT?

96
00:04:32,731 --> 00:04:36,151

00:04:37,861 --> 00:04:38,779
DANNY:

98
00:04:38,862 --> 00:04:40,697
ROLLING ON CEMENT
WITH YOU;

99
00:04:40,781 --> 00:04:42,783
ROLLING IN THE WATER
WITH YOUR SISTER.

100
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,620
IF DAD CATCHES YOU
IN THERE TOGETHER-

101
00:04:46,703 --> 00:04:47,454
LIBERTY:
OH, BUT HE WON'T.

102
00:04:47,538 --> 00:04:49,373
BECAUSE
IF HE COMES HOME,

103
00:04:49,456 --> 00:04:50,749
YOU'LL GIVE US
A SIGNAL.

104
00:04:50,832 --> 00:04:52,584
SOMETHING OBNOXIOUS,
YOU KNOW,

105
00:04:52,668 --> 00:04:54,169
LIKE A BARK.

106
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:04,805

109
00:05:13,522 --> 00:05:15,232
THE TEAM WOULD LIKE

111
00:05:16,942 --> 00:05:18,986
LET'S HAVE A BIG
ROUND OF APPLAUSE

112
00:05:19,069 --> 00:05:20,445
FOR JIMMY BROOKS!

113
00:05:22,239 --> 00:05:23,073
(APPLAUSE)

114
00:05:32,124 --> 00:05:33,166
SPINNER:
ALL RIGHT.

115
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:35,502
YOUR NAME'S ALREADY

116
00:05:35,586 --> 00:05:36,670
BUT FROM NOW ON,

117
00:05:36,753 --> 00:05:41,425
DEGRASSI'S MVP BASKETBALL
AWARD WILL BE KNOWN AS...

118
00:05:42,134 --> 00:05:43,260
THE JIMMY BROOKS TROPHY.

119
00:05:44,136 --> 00:05:46,638
(CHEERING AND CLAPPING)

120
00:05:48,849 --> 00:05:50,058
WOOOOW!

121
00:05:50,142 --> 00:05:51,101
JIMMY:
WOW!

122
00:05:52,561 --> 00:05:55,189
THIS IS DEFINITELY
A SURPRISE.

123
00:05:55,272 --> 00:05:57,316
I GUESS,
ALL I CAN SAY IS

124
00:05:57,941 --> 00:06:00,819
WE GO FOR MVP NUMBER 3
NEXT YEAR, RIGHT?

125
00:06:00,903 --> 00:06:01,653
(CHEERING)

126
00:06:04,948 --> 00:06:05,949
GO PANTHERS!

127
00:06:20,464 --> 00:06:22,841
GOOD AFTERNOON,
DANIEL.

128
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:25,761
YOUR SISTER AROUND?

129
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:29,681
SHE'S OUT BACK,

130
00:06:29,765 --> 00:06:30,933
SOAKING ALL HER
PROBLEMS AWAY.

131
00:06:31,308 --> 00:06:31,808
MM-HMM.

132
00:06:35,812 --> 00:06:36,230
WOOF.

133
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:41,026
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME
MY BUTT WAS SO BIG?

134
00:06:41,109 --> 00:06:43,695
BECAUSE I LIKE
YOUR BUTT.

135
00:06:45,948 --> 00:06:47,950
MR. VAN ZANDT:
OUT! NOW!

136
00:06:48,951 --> 00:06:49,785
WE WERE JUST...

137
00:06:49,868 --> 00:06:50,827
JT, GO HOME.

138
00:06:51,537 --> 00:06:53,497
JT'S ONE OF MY OLDEST
FRIENDS!

139
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:55,916
MR. VAN ZANDT:
HE'S ALSO A TEENAGE BOY.

140
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:57,668
YOU WANT TO SEE JT AGAIN?

141
00:06:57,751 --> 00:06:59,127
WAIT UNTIL YOU'RE TWENTY.

142
00:07:32,202 --> 00:07:35,038
I WAS TRYING
TO DO A LAY-UP.

143
00:07:35,122 --> 00:07:35,789
BETTER WATCH
THE TRAVELING

144
00:07:35,873 --> 00:07:38,000
IF YOU WANNA BE BACK
NEXT YEAR, RIGHT?

145
00:07:38,083 --> 00:07:41,461
THERE WON'T BE
A NEXT YEAR, SPIN.

146
00:07:41,545 --> 00:07:43,797
MY BASKETBALL CAREER,

147
00:07:44,381 --> 00:07:46,091
MY WHOLE FUTURE...

148
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:47,509
IT'S GONE.

149
00:07:48,719 --> 00:07:51,930
JUST LIKE THESE
TWO PIECES OF MEAT.

150
00:07:52,014 --> 00:07:53,015
DUDE, DON'T.

151
00:07:54,516 --> 00:07:56,310
LOOK, STUCK IN A BED
FOR THREE MONTHS,

152
00:07:56,393 --> 00:07:58,395
YOU CAN'T STOP THINKING...

153
00:07:58,896 --> 00:08:00,480
ABOUT GETTING BETTER,
MAN,

154
00:08:00,564 --> 00:08:01,565
AND YOU WILL.

155
00:08:02,816 --> 00:08:03,734
ABOUT RICK,

156
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:05,819
AND HOW I RODE HIM

157
00:08:05,903 --> 00:08:08,197
JUST AS HARD AS YOU GUYS.

158
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:09,281
EVEN HARDER.

159
00:08:11,116 --> 00:08:13,202
YEAH, BUT YOU DIDN'T
SET UP THE PAINT.

160
00:08:13,911 --> 00:08:14,912
I KNOW.

161
00:08:14,995 --> 00:08:17,998
BUT THAT DOESN'T CHANGE
ANYTHING, DOES IT?

162
00:08:18,081 --> 00:08:21,001
RICK PUT ME
IN THIS CHAIR FOR LIFE.

163
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:22,711
FOR LIFE!

164
00:08:26,757 --> 00:08:28,467
SOMETIMES I JUST WISH

165
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:30,219
HE'D HAD BETTER AIM.

166
00:08:31,595 --> 00:08:32,888
FINISH THE JOB.

167
00:08:34,932 --> 00:08:36,600
YOU DON'T MEAN THAT.

168
00:08:39,311 --> 00:08:42,022
HOW DO YOU KNOW
WHAT I MEAN?

169
00:08:42,105 --> 00:08:44,149
ARE YOU IN THE CHAIR?

170
00:08:44,233 --> 00:08:44,566
HUH?

171
00:08:45,943 --> 00:08:48,320
DO YOU WAKE UP EVERY MORNING
THINKING YOU CAN WALK,

172
00:08:48,403 --> 00:08:49,947
AND THEN REMEMBERING

173
00:08:49,947 --> 00:08:51,573
THAT YOU WILL NEVER EVER
WALK AGAIN?!

174
00:08:56,161 --> 00:08:57,829
IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT.

175
00:08:59,122 --> 00:08:59,957
IT'S MINE.

176
00:09:09,466 --> 00:09:11,134
IN THE BATHROOM...

177
00:09:11,218 --> 00:09:14,388
AFTER, AFTER WE DUMPED
THAT STUFF ON RICK,

178
00:09:14,471 --> 00:09:15,430
ME AND JAY...

179
00:09:18,392 --> 00:09:19,977
TOLD HIM
YOU WERE BEHIND IT.

180
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:28,569
AND THEN HE SHOT ME.

181
00:09:49,798 --> 00:09:50,799
GIRL:
THERE HE IS.

182
00:09:50,883 --> 00:09:51,967
BOY:
SUCH A JERK.

183
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:53,552

00:19:07,189 --> 00:19:08,482
WHO WERE YOU TALKING TO?

363
00:19:09,316 --> 00:19:10,067
JUST PRACTICING.

364
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:11,318
ORAL PRESENTATION TODAY.

365
00:19:11,401 --> 00:19:13,153
OH. WELL, KEEP IT UP.

366
00:19:15,322 --> 00:19:17,699
AND DON'T BE LATE
FOR SCHOOL.

367
00:19:19,993 --> 00:19:20,369
'KAY.

368
00:19:20,994 --> 00:19:22,704
COAST IS CLEAR,
GUYS.

369
00:19:25,791 --> 00:19:27,501
OH, GROSS!
I GIVE UP.

370
00:19:33,382 --> 00:19:34,591
GAVIN?

371
00:19:34,675 --> 00:19:37,761
IF YOU'D LIKE TO TALK
SOME OTHER TIME, I-

372
00:19:37,845 --> 00:19:38,929
NO. NO.

373
00:19:39,847 --> 00:19:41,515
I'M READY NOW.

374
00:19:47,688 --> 00:19:48,355
(HEAVY SIGH)

375
00:19:50,357 --> 00:19:52,276
I BULLIED RICK.

376
00:19:52,359 --> 00:19:53,527
A LOT.

377
00:19:53,610 --> 00:19:56,613
AND THE "WHACK
YOUR BRAIN" CONTEST -

378
00:19:56,697 --> 00:19:59,157
THE PAINT
AND FEATHERS THING?

379
00:19:59,241 --> 00:20:00,325
YEAH.

380
00:20:02,411 --> 00:20:03,704
IT WAS MY IDEA.

381
00:20:15,090 --> 00:20:16,800
IS THERE ANYONE ELSE
I NEED TO TALK TO ABOUT THAT?

382
00:20:21,555 --> 00:20:21,972
WELL?

383
00:20:23,098 --> 00:20:24,725
(CLEARS HIS THROAT)

384
00:20:25,684 --> 00:20:26,518
JAY.

385
00:20:27,311 --> 00:20:30,397
JAY HOGART.
HE WAS IN ON IT TOO.

386
00:20:34,776 --> 00:20:36,069
SARAH,
CAN YOU PLEASE PULL

387
00:20:36,153 --> 00:20:37,863
JAY HOGART
OUT OF CLASS?

388
00:20:37,946 --> 00:20:40,782
PLEASE HAVE HIM
WAIT FOR ME.

389
00:20:43,327 --> 00:20:45,829
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHERE TO BEGIN.

390
00:20:45,913 --> 00:20:47,706
THIS IS BEYOND ANYTHING

391
00:20:47,789 --> 00:20:49,208
YOU'VE EVER DONE
AT THIS SCHOOL.

392
00:20:49,291 --> 00:20:50,375
I KNOW. I KNOW.

393
00:20:50,459 --> 00:20:52,961
AND IF YOU HAVE
TO SUSPEND ME-

394
00:20:53,045 --> 00:20:54,546
SUSPEND?!

395
00:20:54,630 --> 00:20:55,589
A BOY DIED.

396
00:20:56,173 --> 00:20:57,841
ANOTHER ONE IS CONFINED
TO A WHEELCHAIR

397
00:20:57,925 --> 00:20:59,885
FOR WHAT MIGHT BE
THE REST OF HIS LIFE.

398
00:21:01,011 --> 00:21:02,346
I'M SORRY.

399
00:21:03,096 --> 00:21:04,848
I KNOW YOU'RE SORRY.

400
00:21:04,932 --> 00:21:08,560
BUT IT DOES NOT CHANGE
WHAT YOU DID.

401
00:21:10,896 --> 00:21:12,356
LOOK, PLEASE GO
TO YOUR LOCKER,

402
00:21:12,439 --> 00:21:13,690
PACK YOUR THINGS,

403
00:21:13,774 --> 00:21:15,567
AND I'LL NOTIFY
YOUR PARENTS.

404
00:21:17,694 --> 00:21:19,154
UM, WHEN DO I
GET TO COME BACK?

405
00:21:19,613 --> 00:21:23,033
GAVIN, WE HAVE ZERO
TOLERANCE FOR BULLYING.

406
00:21:23,116 --> 00:21:25,202
AND I HAVE NO CHOICE.

407
00:21:25,285 --> 00:21:26,370
I'M EXPELLING YOU.

408
00:21:33,544 --> 00:21:34,628
(CRYING)
