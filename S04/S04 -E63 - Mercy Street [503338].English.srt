1
00:00:01,627 --> 00:00:04,171
PAIGE:
SOMEONE TELL ME
I'M HALLUCINATING.

2
00:00:04,254 --> 00:00:05,756
EMMA:
WHO IS HE?

3
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:07,591
SPINNER:
REMEMBER OUR FRIEND
TERRI MACGREGOR?

4
00:00:07,674 --> 00:00:09,426
THE GIRL WHO WAS
IN A COMA LAST YEAR?

5
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:12,304
PAIGE:
HE'S THE PSYCHO
WHO PUT HER THERE.

6
00:00:12,387 --> 00:00:14,515
HIS NAME'S RICK.
HER EX.

7
00:00:14,598 --> 00:00:16,016
HE USED TO BEAT HER.

8
00:00:16,099 --> 00:00:17,809
YEAH, AND HE'S YOUR
NEW CLASSMATE, EMMA.

9
00:00:17,893 --> 00:00:20,437
HE STARTS TENTH GRADE
TOMORROW.

10
00:00:20,521 --> 00:00:22,189
WE HAVE TO DO
SOMETHING.

11
00:00:22,272 --> 00:00:23,440
I KNOW,
LET'S ADOPT A DOLPHIN.

12
00:00:23,524 --> 00:00:25,108
TRAIN HIM TO DEFEND US
FROM RICK.

13
00:00:27,277 --> 00:00:29,530
EMMA:
OR WE COULD TALK
TO MR. RADITCH.

14
00:00:29,613 --> 00:00:30,405
SURE.

15
00:00:30,489 --> 00:00:32,199
ME AND MARCO CAN HANDLE THAT
WITHOUT YOU.

NOW PULL.

29
00:01:39,183 --> 00:01:39,683
(FART)

30
00:01:40,475 --> 00:01:41,852
OH! (LAUGH)

31
00:01:42,561 --> 00:01:43,979
I COULD NOT RESIST.

32
00:01:44,062 --> 00:01:45,147
AGH! THAT WAS A CLASSIC!

33
00:01:54,031 --> 00:01:55,115
THANKS.

34
00:01:55,782 --> 00:01:57,910
SO YOU'RE SURE
YOUR DAD WON'T MIND US

35
00:01:57,993 --> 00:01:59,411
USING HIS HOT TUB
LIKE THIS?

36
00:01:59,494 --> 00:02:00,370
SOMETIMES MANNY,

37
00:02:00,454 --> 00:02:02,164
YOU JUST HAVE TO SAY
WHAT THE HECK.

38
00:02:02,247 --> 00:02:04,249
YOU KNOW WHO
LOVES HOT TUBS?

39
00:02:04,333 --> 00:02:05,042
EMMA NELSON.

40
00:02:05,334 --> 00:02:06,251
NO.

41
00:02:06,335 --> 00:02:08,086
EMMA LIVES FOR STABBING YOU
IN THE BACK,

42
00:02:08,170 --> 00:02:08,879
RIPPING OUT YOUR HEART,

43
00:02:08,962 --> 00:02:09,963
AND STOMPING IT
BLOODLESS

44
00:02:10,047 --> 00:02:11,590
WITH HER POINTY
BALLERINA FEET.

45
00:02:13,717 --> 00:02:15,427
TO TENTH GRADE.

46
00:02:17,429 --> 00:02:19,264
(GOOFING AROUND)

47
00:02:21,517 --> 00:02:23,685
WE'RE GONNA BE SIXTEEN
THIS YEAR.

48
00:02:24,394 --> 00:02:25,229
TO THE FUTURE.

49
00:02:25,312 --> 00:02:26,104
TO GROWING UP,

50
00:02:26,188 --> 00:02:27,814
AND TO LEAVING CHILDISH
THINGS BEHIND.

51
00:02:29,107 --> 00:02:31,068
TO LEAVING CHILDISH
THINGS BEHIND.

52
00:02:34,738 --> 00:02:35,781
DANIEL VAN ZANDT!

53
00:02:35,864 --> 00:02:36,865
THAT'S MOM'S
IRONING BOARD!

54
00:02:36,949 --> 00:02:37,824
DANNY:
IT WAS.

55
00:02:37,908 --> 00:02:39,076
NOW IT'S A DIVING BOARD.

56
00:02:40,536 --> 00:02:41,787
YOU GOTTA THINK
OUTSIDE THE BOX.

57
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:46,208
JT:
NOW, DIVING FOR CANADA,

58
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:48,544
IN THE SEXY RED TRUNKS

59
00:02:48,627 --> 00:02:50,921
JAMES TIBERIUS YORKE!

60
00:02:52,422 --> 00:02:53,215
(GASP)

61
00:02:53,298 --> 00:02:53,966
(LAUGHS)

62
00:02:55,634 --> 00:02:56,760
LOOK! IT'S A STACK
OF DIMES!

63
00:03:10,274 --> 00:03:14,278
"I ALWAYS KNEW YOU WERE
A SMART BOY, MARCO."

64
00:03:14,361 --> 00:03:16,738
CAN YOU EVEN BELIEVE
HE SAID THAT?

65
00:03:16,822 --> 00:03:20,450
EMMA:
WOW, YOU GUYS REALLY
HANDLED RADITCH.

66
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:27,708
RICK:
MARCO. PAIGE.

67
00:03:27,791 --> 00:03:29,084
SPINNER. JIMMY.

68
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,559
EXCUSE ME,
I'VE GOT TO GET BY.

69
00:03:45,642 --> 00:03:47,019
EMMA, STEP ASIDE.

70
00:03:47,102 --> 00:03:49,062
EMMA:
WE DON'T WANT HIM HERE,
MR. RADITCH.

71
00:03:49,146 --> 00:03:50,981
THIS ISN'T ONE OF YOUR
LITTLE CRUSADES, EMMA.

72
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:52,399
THIS IS SERIOUS.

73
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:56,069
I'M WARNING YOU.
STAY OUT OF IT.

74
00:03:57,779 --> 00:03:59,990
SO WHAT'RE WE DOING
FRIDAY NIGHT?

75
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:03,160
YOU, ME, A COUCH?
A ROMANTIC DVD?

76
00:04:03,785 --> 00:04:04,912
UH, YOU KNOW WHAT?

77
00:04:04,995 --> 00:04:06,622
I THINK I MIGHT BE BUSY.

78
00:04:06,705 --> 00:04:08,123
OH.

79
00:04:08,207 --> 00:04:09,541
IS SOMETHING WRONG?

80
00:04:10,167 --> 00:04:12,127
IT'S JUST YOU'VE
BEEN KIND OF DISTANT

81
00:04:12,211 --> 00:04:13,170
SINCE THE HOT TUB PARTY

82
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:13,837
AND UH...

83
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:17,216
IT'S NOT MY...
YOU KNOW?

84
00:04:19,301 --> 00:04:20,344
NO, NO.

85
00:04:20,886 --> 00:04:23,388
THAT WAS STUPID
AND EMBARRASSING.

86
00:04:23,472 --> 00:04:25,557
YOU MUST FEEL AWFUL.

87
00:04:25,641 --> 00:04:28,310
NOTHING A KISS
CAN'T CURE.

88
00:04:33,023 --> 00:04:34,358
CRAIG, HI.

89
00:04:35,067 --> 00:04:35,359
HI.

90
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:37,653
SORRY TO INTERRUPT.

91
00:04:37,736 --> 00:04:39,404
NO. IT'S OKAY.

92
00:04:40,155 --> 00:04:42,908
YOU WEREN'T INTERRUPTING
ANYTHING.

93
00:04:42,991 --> 00:04:44,993
SO HOW WAS YOUR SUMMER?

94
00:04:45,077 --> 00:04:47,120
NOTHING SPECIAL.
YOU?

95
00:04:47,204 --> 00:04:48,121
SAME.

96
00:04:49,873 --> 00:04:51,792
WELL,
I BETTER GET GOING.

97
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:52,626
BYE.

98
00:04:52,709 --> 00:04:53,669
OKAY.

99
00:04:55,045 --> 00:04:57,631
BYE CRAIG.
NICE TO SEE YOU TOO.

100
00:04:58,549 --> 00:05:00,342
HEY MANNY,
I'M STALKER CRAIG.

101
00:05:00,425 --> 00:05:02,970
CAN I LURK AROUND
WHILE YOU KISS JT?

102
00:05:03,053 --> 00:05:06,098
DANNY:
I'D LURK TOO.
MANNY'S SMOKIN'.

103
00:05:06,181 --> 00:05:07,641
MAYBE MANNY'S STILL
HOT FOR HIM.

104
00:05:07,724 --> 00:05:08,642
PLEASE.

105
00:05:08,725 --> 00:05:09,685
TOBY:
LOOK, JT, IN FOUR MONTHS,

106
00:05:09,768 --> 00:05:11,979
YOU AND MANNY HAVE BARELY
EVEN KISSED.

107
00:05:12,062 --> 00:05:13,522
DON'T YOU THINK
SOMETHING'S WRONG?

108
00:05:16,608 --> 00:05:18,694
CRAIG, MANO A MANO?

109
00:05:19,444 --> 00:05:20,654
MANNY IS MY GIRLFRIEND.

110
00:05:20,737 --> 00:05:21,947
OKAY.

111
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:23,699
AND I NEED YOU
TO RESPECT THAT.

112
00:05:23,782 --> 00:05:25,450
I DO. WHATEVER.

113
00:05:25,534 --> 00:05:26,326
JT:
IT'S JUST THAT, YOU KNOW,

114
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:28,036
SOMETIMES YOU HANG...

115
00:05:29,621 --> 00:05:30,914
DOWN AND IT'S-

116
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:34,251
I MEAN AROUND.

117
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:36,503
SOMETIMES YOU
HANG AROUND.

118
00:05:36,587 --> 00:05:37,588
WHAT'RE YOU
LOOKING AT?

119
00:05:37,671 --> 00:05:38,797
WHAT'RE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

120
00:05:38,881 --> 00:05:40,048
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT?

121
00:05:40,132 --> 00:05:41,425
YOU WERE-

122
00:05:42,384 --> 00:05:43,093
YOU WERE
CHECKING OUT MY-

123
00:05:43,177 --> 00:05:45,596
NO, NO, NO,
I WASN'T!

124
00:05:45,679 --> 00:05:46,930
WHAT?!

125
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:49,099
NO, NO, SPINNER,

126
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:50,684
I WASN'T!

127
00:05:50,767 --> 00:05:51,518
THAT'S A LIE!

128
00:05:51,602 --> 00:05:53,353
THAT'S A HORRIBLE...
LIE!

129
00:05:59,276 --> 00:06:01,028
PAIGE?
A MOMENT?

130
00:06:03,947 --> 00:06:06,950
I WAS THINKING MAYBE
WE COULD TALK.

131
00:06:07,034 --> 00:06:09,453
MAYBE BURY THE HATCHET?

132
00:06:10,287 --> 00:06:12,206
YOU PUT MY FRIEND
IN A COMA.

133
00:06:12,289 --> 00:06:13,373
RICK:
ONE,

134
00:06:13,457 --> 00:06:15,584
I KNOW I LET MY ANGER GET
THE BETTER OF ME LAST YEAR,

135
00:06:15,667 --> 00:06:18,879
AND TWO,
I'M IN COUNSELING.

136
00:06:18,962 --> 00:06:21,632
I'M EVEN SEEING
MS. SAUVE.

137
00:06:22,466 --> 00:06:24,760
HOW IS TERRI,
ANYWAY?

138
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:42,778
(EXHALE)

139
00:06:48,659 --> 00:06:49,159
PAIGE?

140
00:06:53,372 --> 00:06:53,872
PAIGE.

141
00:06:59,837 --> 00:07:01,672
IF YOU TELL ANYONE
ABOUT THIS...

142
00:07:01,755 --> 00:07:03,590
I WON'T.
HONEST.

143
00:07:04,508 --> 00:07:06,760
THERE'S A PSYCHO
IN OUR SCHOOL, EMMA,

144
00:07:06,844 --> 00:07:09,346
AND NO ONE IS DOING
A DAMN THING ABOUT IT.

145
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:10,639
BUT WE WILL.

146
00:07:10,722 --> 00:07:12,015
TOGETHER.

147
00:07:14,643 --> 00:07:15,894
OKAY.

148
00:07:15,978 --> 00:07:20,482
BUT I'M NOT SO GOOD
AT THIS WHOLE PROTEST THING.

149
00:07:21,358 --> 00:07:23,235
THAT'S OKAY,
CAUSE I AM.

150
00:07:23,318 --> 00:07:26,822
JUST DON'T CALL ME
"CAUSE GIRL", OKAY?

151
00:07:28,532 --> 00:07:30,158
SO, EMMA,

152
00:07:30,242 --> 00:07:31,451
WHAT'RE YOU DOING NOW?

153
00:07:32,369 --> 00:07:33,787
EMMA:
I WAS GOING TO GO HOME.

154
00:07:33,871 --> 00:07:35,372
PAIGE:
AFTER YOU HAVE
A GREEN TEA FRAPPE

155
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:37,040
WITH ME AT THE DOT.

156
00:07:37,749 --> 00:07:39,126
EMMA:
GOTTA GO SIP A FRAP
WITH PAIGE.

157
00:07:39,209 --> 00:07:41,295
HAVE FUN IN YOUR HOTTUB.

158
00:07:43,172 --> 00:07:44,965
MAC LIPGLASS?
IT SMELLS LIKE VANILLA.

159
00:07:45,048 --> 00:07:46,383
I CAN'T.
IT'S EXPENSIVE.

160
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:47,050
NO, GO AHEAD.

161
00:07:47,134 --> 00:07:48,385
HAZEL AND I ALWAYS SHARE.

162
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:49,887
WE'RE COSMETIC
COMMUNISTS.

163
00:07:53,807 --> 00:07:56,059
SPINNER:
PSYCHO AT 6:00.

164
00:07:56,143 --> 00:07:57,769
OH MY GOD.
I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS.

165
00:07:57,853 --> 00:07:58,562
LET'S GO.

166
00:07:59,313 --> 00:07:59,563
NO.

167
00:08:04,776 --> 00:08:07,779
WE DON'T WANT YOU
AT DEGRASSI.

168
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:11,533
I HAVE A RIGHT
TO AN EDUCATION.

169
00:08:13,327 --> 00:08:14,244
LOOK...

170
00:08:16,246 --> 00:08:20,334
WHAT I DID TO TERRI
LAST YEAR WAS HORRIBLE.

171
00:08:21,168 --> 00:08:23,003
BUT... I'M GETTING
THERAPY.

172
00:08:23,086 --> 00:08:24,004
I'VE CHANGED.

173
00:08:24,087 --> 00:08:25,172
I DON'T CARE.

174
00:08:25,255 --> 00:08:26,507
FIND ANOTHER SCHOOL,
RICK,

175
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:27,925
OR YOU'LL BE SORRY.

176
00:08:28,008 --> 00:08:29,384
IS THAT A THREAT?

177
00:08:29,468 --> 00:08:30,344
BECAUSE MR. RADITCH
WARNED YOU.

178
00:08:30,427 --> 00:08:32,346
YOU CAN'T TOUCH ME.

179
00:08:32,429 --> 00:08:35,265
YEAH. MAYBE NOT
AT DEGRASSI.

180
00:08:54,701 --> 00:08:56,203
PAIGE:
OKAY, SUDDENLY,

181
00:08:56,286 --> 00:08:58,247
EMMA IS COOLER THAN ME.

EMMA:

183
00:09:04,753 --> 00:09:06,296

SEAN:
THIS IS ABOUT RICK,
ISN'T IT?

189
00:09:17,641 --> 00:09:18,809
IT'S A SILENT PROTEST.

190
00:09:18,892 --> 00:09:20,352
WE WANT TO PRESSURE RICK.

191
00:09:20,435 --> 00:09:21,728
MAKE HIS LIFE HELL.

192
00:09:21,812 --> 00:09:24,106
WITHOUT BREAKING
ANY RULES WHATSOEVER.

193
00:09:24,189 --> 00:09:25,607
EMMA'S A GENIUS.

194
00:09:26,316 --> 00:09:27,651
THERE'S NOTHING RADITCH CAN DO.

195
00:09:28,944 --> 00:09:30,946
ELLIE:
WOW. SUCH HEROES.

196
00:09:34,616 --> 00:09:36,410
PAIGE:
WANT TO BUY A RIBBON?

197
00:09:36,493 --> 00:09:38,120
EMMA:

00:09:41,081 --> 00:09:42,207
DANNY:

199
00:09:42,291 --> 00:09:44,918
I HAVE THE SOLUTION
TO JT'S LITTLE PROBLEM.

200
00:09:46,378 --> 00:09:47,796
A PENIS PUMP?

201
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:48,881
HOW DID YOU BUY THIS?

202
00:09:48,964 --> 00:09:50,007
WELL, I DIDN'T.

203
00:09:50,465 --> 00:09:52,050
GUNTHER VON EISENSTADT DID.

204
00:09:52,885 --> 00:09:53,510
TAKE IT OUT.

205
00:09:54,094 --> 00:09:55,679
LOOK, NOT OUT HERE.

206
00:10:03,312 --> 00:10:04,771
DANNY:
THE GUY SAID IT'LL TURN
YOUR GARTER SNAKE

207
00:10:04,855 --> 00:10:06,273
INTO AN ANACONDA.

208
00:10:06,857 --> 00:10:10,068
JT:
I'M NOT PUTTING MY THING
IN THERE.

209
00:10:10,152 --> 00:10:11,278
IT'S A SNAKE.

210
00:10:11,361 --> 00:10:12,112
SNAKES BITE.

211
00:10:12,196 --> 00:10:12,863
DON'T BE STUPID.

212
00:10:12,946 --> 00:10:14,406
IT'S DECORATION.

213
00:10:14,489 --> 00:10:17,075
LET'S SEE
HOW THIS THING WORKS.

214
00:10:21,496 --> 00:10:22,247
STEP ONE.

215
00:10:23,373 --> 00:10:25,334
INSERT MEMBER INTO TUB?

216
00:10:25,834 --> 00:10:26,668
TUB?

217
00:10:27,377 --> 00:10:28,045
WE DON'T HAVE A TUB.

218
00:10:28,128 --> 00:10:30,047
THEY MEAN TUBE.

219
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:32,090
ALL:
OH. (REALIZING)

220
00:10:32,174 --> 00:10:33,717
(SQUEAKY NOISE)

221
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:34,968
ALL:

222
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:37,471
TOBY:
STEP TWO.

223
00:10:37,554 --> 00:10:40,390
USE HAND-PUP
TO MAKE FINE SUCTION.

224
00:10:41,016 --> 00:10:42,100
WHO WROTE THIS?

225
00:10:42,184 --> 00:10:43,018
FORGET THE INSTRUCTIONS.

226
00:10:43,101 --> 00:10:45,312
YOUR WANG GOES IN THE TUBE,
THEN YOU PUMP.

227
00:10:45,395 --> 00:10:48,357
JT:
OKAY, OKAY.
I GOT IT. I GOT IT.

228
00:10:56,573 --> 00:10:58,075
UH... CRAIG,

229
00:10:59,368 --> 00:11:00,994
CRAIG:
YOU DON'T HAVE TO EXPLAIN.

230
00:11:01,078 --> 00:11:02,162
REALLY.

231
00:11:27,479 --> 00:11:42,369

232
00:11:42,452 --> 00:11:58,510
♪♪♪

233
00:11:58,594 --> 00:11:59,761
SIT SOMEWHERE ELSE,
PUNK.

234
00:12:06,685 --> 00:12:07,519
(APPLAUSE)

235
00:12:12,733 --> 00:12:13,609
SPINNER:
OKAY, SO UH...

236
00:12:13,692 --> 00:12:15,777
MS. KWAN HAS ASKED US
TO READ A VERSE

237
00:12:15,861 --> 00:12:16,945
THAT SPEAKS TO OUR HEARTS

238
00:12:17,029 --> 00:12:20,699
AND THIS VERSE
BY KID ELRICK SPEAKS TO MINE.

239
00:12:23,869 --> 00:12:25,996
"I WANTS ME TO FIND
A GIRL TO LOVE

I WANTS ME A GIRL

243
00:12:33,128 --> 00:12:34,296
ENOUGH, GAVIN.

244
00:12:35,797 --> 00:12:37,090
TAKE YOUR SEAT.

245
00:12:37,174 --> 00:12:38,759
OKAY, WHO'S NEXT?

246
00:12:38,842 --> 00:12:39,843
RICK:
MAY I?

247
00:12:50,854 --> 00:12:53,690
I'D LIKE TO READ YOU SOME
THOUGHTS FROM MAHATMA GANDHI.

248
00:12:56,985 --> 00:12:59,321
"THE WEAK CAN NEVER FORGIVE.

249
00:13:01,031 --> 00:13:04,576
FORGIVENESS IS THE ATTRIBUTE
OF THE STRONG."

250
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:07,162
IT IS THE QUALITY OF THE BRAVE,

251
00:13:07,246 --> 00:13:08,997
NOT THE COWARDLY..."

252
00:13:09,623 --> 00:13:13,043
KWAN:
GAVIN. PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE NOW!

253
00:13:13,126 --> 00:13:13,460

(BELL RINGS)

255
00:13:19,466 --> 00:13:21,760
JT:
DANNY, THE COBRA HAS LANDED.

256
00:13:21,844 --> 00:13:23,804
I JUST WENT FOR A WALK
WITH THE KING.

257
00:13:23,887 --> 00:13:25,556
THE JAM,
DID IT WORK?

258
00:13:25,639 --> 00:13:26,974
I THINK SO.

259
00:13:27,057 --> 00:13:29,226
WELL, LET HER
BE THE JUDGE.

260
00:13:30,561 --> 00:13:32,771
JT'S GONNA COME
OVER HERE.

261
00:13:32,855 --> 00:13:33,605
I KNOW IT.

262
00:13:33,689 --> 00:13:35,607
WHY WON'T HE LEAVE
ME ALONE?

263
00:13:35,691 --> 00:13:37,776
BECAUSE HE'S YOUR
BOYFRIEND?

264
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:39,611
LOOK, MANNY, IF THAT'S
HOW YOU FEEL ABOUT HIM

265
00:13:39,695 --> 00:13:41,280
THEN YOU NEED
TO BREAK UP.

266
00:13:41,363 --> 00:13:42,781
NO, I CAN'T.

267
00:13:44,366 --> 00:13:45,784
IT'LL KILL HIM.

268
00:13:45,868 --> 00:13:47,870
BUT YOU CAN'T GO ON
LIKE THIS.

269
00:13:47,953 --> 00:13:51,456
JUST SIT HIM DOWN
TONIGHT AND DO IT.

270
00:13:52,291 --> 00:13:53,458
JT:
HEY.

271
00:13:54,585 --> 00:13:55,794
HI.

272
00:13:55,878 --> 00:13:57,254
I WAS WONDERING IF MAYBE

273
00:13:57,337 --> 00:13:59,256
YOU WANTED TO COME OVER

OKAY.

279
00:14:13,645 --> 00:14:14,813
ONE, IT'LL ONLY TAKE
A MINUTE.

280
00:14:14,897 --> 00:14:17,149
TWO,
IT'S TO GIVE YOU THIS.

281
00:14:18,609 --> 00:14:19,985
IT'S A CHEQUE.

282
00:14:20,068 --> 00:14:21,278
I CAN'T TAKE YOUR MONEY,
RICK.

283
00:14:21,361 --> 00:14:23,113
THE WHOLE RIBBON CAMPAIGN
IS ABOUT YOU.

284
00:14:25,073 --> 00:14:26,617

287
00:14:31,747 --> 00:14:33,957
I'D DONATE MORE
BUT IT'S ALL I HAVE.

288
00:14:34,041 --> 00:14:35,542
YOU CAN'T BUY FORGIVENESS,
RICK.

289
00:14:35,626 --> 00:14:36,960
IT'S AN ANONYMOUS DONATION.

290
00:14:37,044 --> 00:14:38,045
NO ONE NEEDS TO KNOW
BUT YOU.

291
00:14:38,128 --> 00:14:39,713
ALEX:
TOO LATE.

292
00:14:39,796 --> 00:14:41,048
NOBODY WANTS
YOUR GUILT-MONEY.

293
00:14:41,131 --> 00:14:42,132
ALEX, LISTEN TO ME-

294
00:14:42,216 --> 00:14:42,758
OR WHAT, FREAK?

295
00:14:42,841 --> 00:14:44,092
ARE YOU GONNA PUT ME
IN A COMA, TOO?

PLEASE?

297
00:14:57,314 --> 00:14:57,731
NICE.

REAL NICE, ALEX.

299
00:14:59,733 --> 00:15:02,152
MAYBE IF YOU CARED
ABOUT THE CAUSE...

300
00:15:02,236 --> 00:15:04,196
WHAT DO YOU KNOW
ABOUT IT?

301
00:15:04,279 --> 00:15:05,822
YOU EVER ICE
YOUR MOM'S LIP?

302
00:15:05,906 --> 00:15:07,115
BANDAGE HER UP?

303
00:15:09,076 --> 00:15:11,119
LAY AWAKE AT NIGHT
LISTENING TO HER CRY?

304
00:15:13,622 --> 00:15:15,457
DIDN'T THINK SO.

305
00:15:26,593 --> 00:15:27,511
OH! MY GOD.

306
00:15:29,555 --> 00:15:30,389
(KNOCKING)

307
00:15:31,974 --> 00:15:32,474
ENTRE.

308
00:15:42,734 --> 00:15:43,819
WHAT HAPPENED IN HERE?

309
00:15:45,529 --> 00:15:46,446
OH, NOTHING.

310
00:15:46,530 --> 00:15:49,157
I JUST MADE IT
A LITTLE COZIER.

311
00:16:05,174 --> 00:16:07,009
ARE, ARE YOU NERVOUS?

312
00:16:08,177 --> 00:16:09,428
NO. NOT AT ALL.

313
00:16:13,473 --> 00:16:14,391
UM...

314
00:16:15,851 --> 00:16:18,103
YOUR LIPS
ARE KINDA SWEATY.

315
00:16:18,187 --> 00:16:19,605
OH, SORRY.

316
00:16:19,688 --> 00:16:22,649
I GUESS I AM
KIND OF NERVOUS.

317
00:16:26,028 --> 00:16:28,405
I HAVE TO GO
TO THE BATHROOM.

318
00:16:28,488 --> 00:16:30,908
OH, ALL RIGHT.
WELL, NO RUSH.

319
00:16:30,991 --> 00:16:35,162
I GUESS, I COULD USE
A MINUTE TO FRESHEN UP.

320
00:16:46,256 --> 00:16:47,216
SUCK IT UP.

321
00:16:48,967 --> 00:16:50,302
YOU CAN DO THIS.

322
00:16:59,895 --> 00:17:00,729
AGH! I CAN EXPLAIN.

PAIGE:
DID YOU SEE HEATHER SINCLAIR'S
EYEBROWS?

324
00:17:12,908 --> 00:17:14,159
TRAGICALLY OVER-PLUCKED.

325
00:17:14,243 --> 00:17:18,580
EMMA:
THEY SHOULD CONFISCATE HER
TWEEZERS OR SOMETHING.

326
00:17:18,664 --> 00:17:20,290
PAIGE:
HEY! WHAT IS HE DOING HERE
AGAIN.

327
00:17:22,042 --> 00:17:23,460
HE PROBABLY CAME TO SEE
HIS NEW CRUSH -

328
00:17:23,544 --> 00:17:24,461

PAIGE:
WHAT'S SHE TALKING ABOUT?

330
00:17:26,922 --> 00:17:27,923
NOTHING.

331
00:17:28,006 --> 00:17:28,674
RICK TALKED TO ME.

332
00:17:28,757 --> 00:17:29,591
IT WAS NO BIG DEAL.

333
00:17:30,175 --> 00:17:31,343
DIDN'T SEEM THAT WAY
TO ME.

334
00:17:32,261 --> 00:17:33,178
IF YOU'RE STARTING
TO WIMP OUT

335
00:17:33,262 --> 00:17:35,055
AND FEEL SORRY
FOR THAT PSYCHO...

336
00:17:35,138 --> 00:17:36,765
I'M NOT.
HONEST.

337
00:17:43,981 --> 00:17:45,065

339
00:18:06,753 --> 00:18:07,588
THAT'S IT.

340
00:18:08,297 --> 00:18:09,464
IT'S ON!

341
00:18:14,469 --> 00:18:15,387

YOU STARTED THIS, CAUSE GIRL.

343
00:18:17,139 --> 00:18:18,432
LET'S GO.

344
00:18:20,392 --> 00:18:21,393
WHAT'RE YOU GOING
TO DO?

345
00:18:21,476 --> 00:18:22,144
HURT ME?

346
00:18:25,314 --> 00:18:28,400
ONE, VIOLENCE
IS NEVER THE ANSWER.

347
00:18:28,483 --> 00:18:30,652

356
00:19:27,793 --> 00:19:28,919
MANNY:
GO AWAY, JT.

357
00:19:29,002 --> 00:19:30,712
JT:
WILL YOU LET ME EXPLAIN?

358
00:19:30,796 --> 00:19:32,798
I WAS JUST TRYING
TO LIVE UP TO CRAIG.

359
00:19:32,881 --> 00:19:33,882
WHAT?

360
00:19:34,508 --> 00:19:36,885
I SAW HIM
IN THE LOCKER ROOM...

361
00:19:36,969 --> 00:19:38,053
NAKED.

362
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:41,765
AND IT BECAME
OBVIOUS TO ME THAT...

363
00:19:41,849 --> 00:19:44,893
HE HAS SOMETHING
THAT I DON'T.

364
00:19:44,977 --> 00:19:45,894
YOU KNOW WHAT, JT?

365
00:19:45,978 --> 00:19:48,397
CRAIG DOES HAVE
SOMETHING YOU DON'T.

366
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:49,773
MATURITY.

367
00:19:50,816 --> 00:19:53,485
AND I DON'T MEAN
HIS SIZE.

368
00:19:54,444 --> 00:19:56,655
I MEAN THE WAY HE ACTS.

369
00:19:56,738 --> 00:20:00,200
YOU'RE ALWAYS FARTING
AND JOKING AROUND.

370
00:20:00,284 --> 00:20:02,119
WELL, I'M SORRY.

371
00:20:03,328 --> 00:20:05,247
JUST GIVE ME ANOTHER
CHANCE, OKAY?

372
00:20:05,330 --> 00:20:06,915
I CAN CHANGE.

373
00:20:07,958 --> 00:20:08,667
NO.

374
00:20:09,334 --> 00:20:11,003
JT, I'M SORRY.

375
00:20:12,504 --> 00:20:13,839
IT'S OVER.

376
00:20:36,278 --> 00:20:38,238
NICE GLASSES.

377
00:20:38,322 --> 00:20:40,908
THEY'RE FROM
SIXTH GRADE.

378
00:20:42,618 --> 00:20:43,952
I WANTED TO
THANK YOU.

379
00:20:44,036 --> 00:20:44,995
WELL DON'T.

380
00:20:46,705 --> 00:20:48,165
THINGS GOT OUT OF HAND
AND I STOPPED IT.

381
00:20:48,248 --> 00:20:49,291
IT DOESN'T MEAN
I LIKE YOU

382
00:20:49,374 --> 00:20:50,834
AND IT DOESN'T MEAN
WE'RE FRIENDS.

383
00:20:55,214 --> 00:20:55,547
BUT...

384
00:20:56,715 --> 00:20:58,425
RICK, WHY DID YOU
COME BACK HERE?

385
00:21:01,261 --> 00:21:03,096
I LIKE IT AT DEGRASSI.

386
00:21:04,264 --> 00:21:05,599
WELL, I USED TO.

387
00:21:08,101 --> 00:21:09,394
I WAS HORRIBLE...

388
00:21:10,562 --> 00:21:11,605
BUT I'VE CHANGED.

389
00:21:14,399 --> 00:21:15,442
ALL THOSE PEOPLE
WHO HATE ME,

390
00:21:15,526 --> 00:21:18,779
I WANT TO LET THEM SEE
WHO I REALLY AM,

391
00:21:20,030 --> 00:21:21,240
SHOW THEM HOW WRONG
THEY ARE.

392
00:21:22,658 --> 00:21:23,075
WELL...

393
00:21:24,743 --> 00:21:25,953
THEY'RE NOT INTERESTED,
RICK.

394
00:21:28,539 --> 00:21:30,207
THEY WILL BE.

395
00:21:30,999 --> 00:21:32,251
SOMEDAY.
