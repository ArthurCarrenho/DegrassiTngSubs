00:00:04,213 --> 00:00:06,256
ALEX:
OW! STOP! OW!

2
00:00:06,965 --> 00:00:08,425
AMY:
I LOVE HOW MATURE
YOUR BOYFRIEND IS.

3
00:00:08,509 --> 00:00:10,010
ALEX:
PUT ME DOWN.

4
00:00:12,971 --> 00:00:14,014
GREAT.

5
00:00:14,097 --> 00:00:14,640
FIRST DOCTOR'S NOTE
I HAVE

6
00:00:14,723 --> 00:00:15,891
THAT ISN'T A FORGERY

7
00:00:15,974 --> 00:00:17,017
AND MR. "I-CAN-PICK-
UP-A-GIRL"

8
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:18,936
HAS TO MAKE IT
LOOK ALL SUSPICIOUS.

9
00:00:28,862 --> 00:00:29,780
NATE:
HEY, EMMA.

10
00:00:29,863 --> 00:00:32,491
DID JT SAY WHERE WE'RE SUPPOSED
TO LEAVE OUR COSTUMES?

11
00:00:40,541 --> 00:00:42,376
NATE:
I'VE HAD MORE CONVERSATIONS
WITH THE JANITOR

12
00:00:42,459 --> 00:00:43,377
THAN I'VE HAD WITH YOU.

13
00:00:44,545 --> 00:00:45,254
I WAS ACTING.

14
00:00:45,838 --> 00:00:49,591
JUST KISSING ALL MY NERVES OUT
PRE-DRESS REHEARSAL.

15
00:00:49,675 --> 00:00:50,884
BUT DON'T WORRY, NATE.

16
00:00:50,968 --> 00:00:52,803
I'LL WAIT FOR MY CUE

FOR DRACULA

29
00:01:53,697 --> 00:01:56,617
OR ARE YOU TRYING
TO MESS WITH ME?

30
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:59,453
ARE YOU GOING TO BE
IN THE RAVINE AGAIN TONIGHT?

31
00:01:59,536 --> 00:02:01,330
ARE WE GOING TO PARTY?

32
00:02:01,413 --> 00:02:03,123
I THINK I NEED
ANOTHER BRACELET.

33
00:02:03,207 --> 00:02:05,584
I DON'T LIKE BEING
MESSED WITH, OKAY?

34
00:02:05,667 --> 00:02:06,919
I KNOW.

35
00:02:07,002 --> 00:02:08,337
SIMPSON:
I NEED A MINUTE
WITH MY DAUGHTER.

36
00:02:11,215 --> 00:02:12,716
OH, THAT'S ADORABLE, SIR.

37
00:02:13,675 --> 00:02:15,093
CUT THE COMMENTARY,
JASON. GO.

38
00:02:20,057 --> 00:02:24,394
AND STAND BY FOR CONCERNED
FATHER FIGURE LECTURE.

39
00:02:26,104 --> 00:02:28,232
YOU COME IN AT 3:00
IN THE MORNING

40
00:02:28,315 --> 00:02:30,275
HYSTERICAL, CRYING,

41
00:02:30,359 --> 00:02:31,527
WANTING TO TALK
ABOUT THE SHOOTING

42
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:33,195
AND NOW YOU'RE KISSING
RANDOM GUYS?

43
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:36,782
IT WASN'T RANDOM.

44
00:02:36,865 --> 00:02:37,824
PLEASE, EM.

45
00:02:37,908 --> 00:02:39,159
LET ME BE HERE FOR YOU.

46
00:02:39,243 --> 00:02:40,285
LET ME TALK TO YOU.

47
00:02:43,622 --> 00:02:44,915
THE BELL'S GOING
TO GO.

48
00:02:54,466 --> 00:02:55,843
NURSE PAULA:
THANKS, MARCO.

49
00:02:55,926 --> 00:02:58,637
I'M TAPING THIS ONE
RIGHT TO MY COMPUTER MONITOR.

50
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,639
TAKE CARE, JIMMY.

51
00:03:03,058 --> 00:03:04,268
JIMMY:
POOR NURSE PAULA,

52
00:03:04,351 --> 00:03:06,103
SHE'S GONNA MISS ME.

53
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:07,354
BUT HOME...

54
00:03:07,437 --> 00:03:10,607
HAS A FULL FRIDGE
AND A WIDE-SCREEN.

55
00:03:10,691 --> 00:03:12,359
MARCO:
CRAIG AND I CAN COME
HANG OUT

56
00:03:12,442 --> 00:03:14,236
WITHOUT VISITING HOURS.

57
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:16,446
WE CAN PLAY KID ELRICK
AS LOUD AS WE WANT.

58
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:17,865
YEAH, YOUR DAD
CAN TUCK YOU IN

59
00:03:17,948 --> 00:03:19,366
INSTEAD OF
NURSE PAULA.

60
00:03:21,451 --> 00:03:22,160
SHE'S THE ONLY THING
I'M GOING TO MISS

61
00:03:22,244 --> 00:03:24,162
ABOUT THIS PLACE.

62
00:03:24,788 --> 00:03:26,039
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

63
00:03:27,708 --> 00:03:29,209
DON'T BLOCK THE DOORWAY,
POPS.

64
00:03:29,293 --> 00:03:30,627
NO TIME FOR SPEEDBUMPS.

65
00:03:30,711 --> 00:03:31,253
YOU READY?

66
00:03:32,462 --> 00:03:33,338
YOU LOOK GOOD, JIM.

67
00:03:35,257 --> 00:03:36,675
I DON'T LIKE
"YOU LOOK GOOD, JIM".

68
00:03:39,636 --> 00:03:40,804
THE RAILS THEY'RE
PUTTING IN AT THE CONDO,

69
00:03:40,888 --> 00:03:42,431
THEY'RE NOT DONE.

70
00:03:42,514 --> 00:03:43,849
NOT YET.

71
00:03:43,932 --> 00:03:45,601
JIMMY:
SO?

72
00:03:45,684 --> 00:03:47,227
SO I'M ALL OVER
THE CONTRACTORS.

73
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:48,687
SO?

74
00:03:50,606 --> 00:03:51,857
ONE MORE WEEK - TOPS.

75
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:53,358
MAYBE SOONER
IF I CAN STRING IT.

76
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,737
MR. BROOKS,

77
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:57,863
JIMMY GETS AROUND
WELL.

78
00:03:58,405 --> 00:03:59,740
I KNOW, JIMMY HAS MADE
GREAT PROGRESS,

79
00:03:59,823 --> 00:04:03,243
BUT I CAN'T BE WITH HIM
24-7 RIGHT NOW.

80
00:04:03,327 --> 00:04:04,328
AND I DON'T WANT SOMETHING
HAPPENING,

81
00:04:04,411 --> 00:04:05,454
SOMETHING THAT'S
GOING TO TRASH

82
00:04:05,537 --> 00:04:06,663
ALL THE PROGRESS
THAT HE'S MADE.

83
00:04:07,873 --> 00:04:10,209
HE REALLY WANTS
TO GO.

84
00:04:11,001 --> 00:04:12,336
WHAT ABOUT
MRS. BROOKS?

85
00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:12,794
OR A NURSE?

86
00:04:12,878 --> 00:04:14,129
I MEAN, WE COULD
EVEN HELP OUT.

87
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:17,216
FORGET IT, GUYS.

88
00:04:17,299 --> 00:04:18,008
WHATEVER.

89
00:04:24,973 --> 00:04:26,266
DANNY:
16TH MAY.

90
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:28,936
CASTLE DRACULA
IS A VIRTUAL PRISON

91
00:04:29,019 --> 00:04:30,729
AND I'M ITS PRISONER.

92
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:36,610
IF NATE WAS
FIFTY AND FAT,

93
00:04:36,693 --> 00:04:39,655
YOU COULD'VE CAUSED
CARDIAC ARREST.

94
00:04:39,738 --> 00:04:41,031
ANYTHING FOR
THE THEATRE.

95
00:04:41,782 --> 00:04:42,866
SHHHHH!

96
00:04:44,826 --> 00:04:47,329
I NEED COMPLETE
TEEN-GIRL DETAILS.

97
00:04:47,412 --> 00:04:49,665
WHY? GOOD? TONGUE?

98
00:04:49,748 --> 00:04:50,541
LIKE IT OR NOT,

99
00:04:50,624 --> 00:04:51,959
YOU BRING ANSWERS
OVER TONIGHT.

100
00:04:52,751 --> 00:04:53,919
I HAVE TO GO TO
THE RAVINE TONIGHT.

101
00:04:54,002 --> 00:04:54,753
I'M MEETING
SOME PEOPLE.

102
00:04:56,547 --> 00:04:58,340
IS IT TOO MUCH
TO ASK FOR SILENCE

103
00:04:58,423 --> 00:04:59,842
IN THE PEANUT GALLERY?

104
00:05:00,884 --> 00:05:05,347
DANNY:
THERE IN THE MOONLIGHT
WERE THREE YOUNG WOMEN.

105
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:07,641
THREE?

106
00:05:08,892 --> 00:05:10,227
AM I EVER GONNA
GET THREE OF THEM?

107
00:05:10,727 --> 00:05:11,645
ALEX IS AT THE DOCTORS.

108
00:05:11,728 --> 00:05:12,771
SHE SHOULD BE BACK.

109
00:05:13,897 --> 00:05:16,191
JAY:
LEXI, IT WAS NOTHING.
C'MON.

110
00:05:16,275 --> 00:05:17,651
JT:
"LEXI" IS LATE FOR HER SCENE.

111
00:05:17,734 --> 00:05:19,528
ALEX:
YOU WANT A SCENE, JT?

112
00:05:19,611 --> 00:05:23,365
HEY "BEST FRIEND AMY",
LET'S GIVE JT A SCENE.

113
00:05:23,991 --> 00:05:26,201
TELL ME ABOUT
THE RAVINE, AMY!

114
00:05:26,285 --> 00:05:29,162
ABOUT HOW YOU WENT DOWN
ON MY BOYFRIEND, AMY!

115
00:05:29,246 --> 00:05:30,622
AND THE BRACELETS
YOU GOT FOR IT.

116
00:05:30,706 --> 00:05:31,999
AMY:
I DIDN'T SLEEP WITH HIM!

117
00:05:32,082 --> 00:05:33,083
ALEX:
BY WHOSE DEFINITION?

118
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:35,002
JAY:
COME OUTSIDE, ALEX.

119
00:05:35,085 --> 00:05:36,837
DON'T TOUCH ME.

120
00:05:37,379 --> 00:05:39,423
DON'T TALK TO ME.

121
00:05:39,506 --> 00:05:41,008
I'LL DECK YOUR
SMUG FACE, TOO.

122
00:05:50,475 --> 00:05:53,687
NURSE PAULA:
SHAKE IT OFF, MOPEY BROOKS.

123
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:55,480
I'M NOT MOPEY.

124
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:57,316
YOU KNOW,
A CHAIR'S ONLY A PRISON

125
00:05:57,399 --> 00:05:58,901
IF YOU LET IT BE.

126
00:05:58,984 --> 00:06:00,944
OKAY. STOP THE
INSPIRATIONAL QUOTES.

127
00:06:01,028 --> 00:06:01,904
I'M NOT BUYING IT.

128
00:06:01,987 --> 00:06:05,032
WHAT YOU SHOULDN'T BUY
IS YOUR DAD'S ATTITUDE.

129
00:06:05,115 --> 00:06:06,909
YOU AND I BOTH KNOW

130
00:06:06,992 --> 00:06:10,204
JIMMY BROOKS CAN DO WHATEVER
HE SETS HIS MIND TO.

131
00:06:10,287 --> 00:06:11,955
AT LEAST, I KNOW IT.

132
00:06:20,214 --> 00:06:22,049
MANNY:
IT DOESN'T TAKE SHERLOCK HOLMES
TO FIGURE IT OUT.

133
00:06:22,132 --> 00:06:25,052
WHY WOULD YOU HOOK UP
WITH JAY?

134
00:06:25,135 --> 00:06:26,136
ARE YOU IN LOVE
WITH HIM?

135
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:28,222
NO, OF COURSE NOT.

136
00:06:28,305 --> 00:06:30,933
SO WHAT DO YOU
GET OUT OF IT?

137
00:06:31,016 --> 00:06:32,893
THAT'S A REALLY
STUPID QUESTION.

138
00:06:32,976 --> 00:06:35,020
NO, WHAT YOU'RE
DOING IS STUPID.

139
00:06:35,103 --> 00:06:37,397
YOU'RE LETTING A DISGUSTING
BOTTOM-FEEDER USE YOU

140
00:06:37,481 --> 00:06:39,233
TO SERIAL-CHEAT
ON HIS GIRLFRIEND.

141
00:06:39,316 --> 00:06:41,777
SHOULD YOU REALLY BE PREACHING
TO ANYONE ABOUT THAT?

142
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:43,237
WE'RE NOT HAVING
REAL SEX.

143
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,655
IT'S PRETTY CLOSE!

144
00:06:44,738 --> 00:06:46,073
BUT I'M NOT
GETTING PREGNANT.

145
00:06:48,742 --> 00:06:50,035
WHY ARE YOU TRYING
TO HURT ME?

146
00:06:50,118 --> 00:06:51,954
BECAUSE YOU WON'T
LEAVE ME ALONE.

147
00:06:53,664 --> 00:06:54,540
YOU'RE BETTER THAN THIS.

148
00:06:54,623 --> 00:06:55,832
YOU'RE BETTER THAN
WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

149
00:06:55,916 --> 00:06:57,251
WHAT DO YOU KNOW
ABOUT WHO I AM

150
00:06:57,334 --> 00:06:59,211
OR WHAT I'M WORTH
OR ANYTHING?

151
00:07:04,842 --> 00:07:06,260
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

152
00:07:06,343 --> 00:07:07,261
MARCO:
SPECIAL DELIVERY

153
00:07:07,344 --> 00:07:11,014
FROM THE SORRY-YOUR-DAD-
A-SUCKS-A PIZZERIA.

154
00:07:12,099 --> 00:07:14,476
JIMMY:
I'LL HOLD OUT 'TIL TOMORROW.

155
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,520
CRAIG:
WHAT'S TOMORROW?

156
00:07:17,187 --> 00:07:18,856
JIMMY:
STUDENT COUNCIL PREZ-MAN

157
00:07:18,939 --> 00:07:21,316
GETS YOU BOTH OUT
OF SCHOOL.

158
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:25,070
AND THEN YOU COME OVER HERE
AND BUST ME OUT.

159
00:07:27,155 --> 00:07:29,157
CRAIG:
SOUNDS LIKE TROUBLE.

160
00:07:29,241 --> 00:07:31,994
I'M NOT GOOD
WITH TROUBLE.

161
00:07:32,953 --> 00:07:35,038
I NEED TO SEE
SOMETHING

162
00:07:35,122 --> 00:07:36,790
BEYOND YOU TWO

163
00:07:37,916 --> 00:07:40,544
AND THESE
UGLY-ASS WALLS.

164
00:07:48,302 --> 00:07:49,052
TOMORROW.

165
00:07:50,387 --> 00:07:51,972
YOU'RE HOUDINI
ON WHEELS.

166
00:07:52,723 --> 00:07:53,348
OKAY.

167
00:07:54,224 --> 00:07:57,311
AND HOUDINI WANTS
TO SEE KID ELRICK.

168
00:07:58,353 --> 00:08:00,272
LIVE.
TOMORROW NIGHT.

169
00:08:00,898 --> 00:08:01,732
YEAH.

170
00:08:08,614 --> 00:08:10,490
EMMA:
HEY, HAVE YOU SEEN JAY?

171
00:08:10,574 --> 00:08:12,034
GUY:
HANG WITH ME INSTEAD.

172
00:08:12,117 --> 00:08:13,952
YOU CAN USE ANOTHER FRIEND,
RIGHT?

173
00:08:14,036 --> 00:08:15,829
EMMA:
FRIENDS WITH BENEFITS.

174
00:08:15,913 --> 00:08:17,998
GUY:
HEY, WE COULD ALL USE
A GOOD BENEFIT TOO.

175
00:08:18,081 --> 00:08:19,917
EMMA:
MAYBE NEXT TIME.

176
00:08:27,466 --> 00:08:29,635
EMMA:

SHOW OF HANDS.

241
00:11:36,029 --> 00:11:39,658
ORAL SEX IS SAFER THAN
REGULAR INTERCOURSE?

242
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:44,371
WE THINK THERE'S BEEN
A MINI OUTBREAK

243
00:11:44,454 --> 00:11:45,956

MRS. BANERJEE:
IT'S NOT A VERY NICE WORD,
IS IT?

249
00:11:55,924 --> 00:11:57,301
GONORRHEA.

250
00:11:57,384 --> 00:12:00,304
AND HOW DO YOU KNOW
IF YOU HAVE GONORRHEA?

251
00:12:00,387 --> 00:12:00,804
WELL...

252
00:12:04,308 --> 00:12:07,769
SOME SYMPTOMS
ARE GENITAL DISCHARGE,

253
00:12:07,853 --> 00:12:09,563
BLEEDING, BURNING.

254
00:12:10,522 --> 00:12:12,149
ORALLY, YOU MIGHT GET A FEVER
OR SORE THROAT.

255
00:12:13,775 --> 00:12:15,110
HEY, EM, YOU GOT
SOMETHING TO TELL US?

256

LUCKY, YOU MIGHT THINK.

260
00:12:24,286 --> 00:12:25,746
THINK AGAIN.

261
00:12:25,829 --> 00:12:28,415
UNTREATED, GONORRHEA
CAN CAUSE ARTHRITIS,

262
00:12:28,498 --> 00:12:30,751
HEART DISEASE,
INFERTILITY.

263
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:34,379

IF YOU'VE HAD ANY SEX
WITHOUT USING ONE OF THESE,

00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:46,225
YOU'RE AT RISK.

268
00:12:46,308 --> 00:12:48,519
THIS APPLIES TO ORAL SEX
AS WELL,

269
00:12:48,602 --> 00:12:51,438
ESPECIALLY IF YOU'VE HAD IT
WITH A BUNCH OF PEOPLE.

270
00:12:51,522 --> 00:12:53,941
OR IF YOUR PARTNER HAS.

271
00:13:06,954 --> 00:13:08,539

00:17:51,029 --> 00:17:53,156
NOT ANY OF THAT.

352
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:56,076
COME ON, WHO ARE YOU
TRYING TO FOOL?

353
00:17:56,159 --> 00:17:58,161
EVERYBODY KNOWS.

354
00:17:58,245 --> 00:18:00,247
EVERYBODY KNOWS
ABOUT THE REAL YOU.

355
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:01,248
JUST...

356
00:18:06,211 --> 00:18:07,004
DANNY:
DEAREST LUCY...

357
00:18:07,087 --> 00:18:08,881
FORGIVE ME.

358
00:18:08,964 --> 00:18:10,716
FORGIVE US ALL!

359
00:18:11,842 --> 00:18:12,759
(SCREAMING)

360
00:18:13,343 --> 00:18:16,430
HOLD FAST, DEAR BOY.
HOLD FAST!

361
00:18:29,610 --> 00:18:30,485
CRAIG:
MAN, WE WERE SO CLOSE

362
00:18:30,569 --> 00:18:32,654
THE KID WAS BASICALLY
SWEATING ON US.

363
00:18:32,738 --> 00:18:34,031
MARCO:
MAN, I'M NEVER GONNA SHOWER.

364
00:18:35,574 --> 00:18:36,575
CRAIG:
WHAT?

365
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:40,454
JIMMY:
THE KID SMELLS
LIKE JACK DANIELS.

366
00:18:40,537 --> 00:18:42,414
MR. BROOKS:
YOUR NURSE CALLED.

367
00:18:42,497 --> 00:18:43,498
I'M FURIOUS.

368
00:18:47,252 --> 00:18:49,588
SO WHAT ARE YOU
GOING TO DO,

369
00:18:49,671 --> 00:18:51,006
GROUND ME?

370
00:18:55,093 --> 00:18:59,348
LOOK, TODAY WAS
AN OBSTACLE COURSE, OKAY?

371
00:18:59,431 --> 00:19:02,267
AND I BROUGHT MY "A" GAME.

372
00:19:02,351 --> 00:19:03,393
I HAD AN "A" GAME.

373
00:19:03,477 --> 00:19:04,353
JAMES, LISTEN.

374
00:19:04,436 --> 00:19:07,481
NO, I'M READY
TO COME HOME.

375
00:19:07,564 --> 00:19:09,024
NOW YOU HAVE
TO BE READY FOR IT.

376
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:22,371
WILL YOU BE HERE
TOMORROW MORNING?

377
00:19:22,454 --> 00:19:23,705
DEPENDS.

378
00:19:24,164 --> 00:19:24,831
WHAT ARE YOU OFFERING?

379
00:19:25,624 --> 00:19:27,626
WE'LL FIND YOU
A HOME-CARE PERSON

380
00:19:27,709 --> 00:19:29,127
TO FILL IN THE GAP,

381
00:19:29,211 --> 00:19:31,797
BE WITH YOU
ALL THE TIME.

382
00:19:32,631 --> 00:19:33,549
OKAY?

383
00:19:40,764 --> 00:19:41,682
OKAY.

384
00:19:46,645 --> 00:19:47,980
THANK YOU.

385
00:19:52,150 --> 00:19:53,735
SPIKE:
SHE WAS SO AMAZING.

386
00:19:53,819 --> 00:19:56,405
I COULDN'T BELIEVE
IT WAS THE SAME GIRL.

387
00:19:56,488 --> 00:19:59,199
SIMPSON:
KATE HEPBURN WAS REBORN.

388
00:20:00,367 --> 00:20:02,411
SPIKE:
DID WE WAKE YOU,
MISS HEPBURN?

389
00:20:02,494 --> 00:20:04,580
EMMA:
I WASN'T ASLEEP.

390
00:20:04,663 --> 00:20:06,582
SIMPSON:
POST-SHOW ADRENALINE.

391
00:20:06,665 --> 00:20:08,834
YOU PROBABLY FEEL FANTASTIC
RIGHT NOW, HUH?

392
00:20:08,917 --> 00:20:10,085
AND FOR THE RECORD?

393
00:20:10,169 --> 00:20:12,671
SNAKE AND ME WALKING
ON EGGSHELLS AROUND YOU

394
00:20:12,754 --> 00:20:14,715
IS OFFICIALLY OVER.

395
00:20:14,798 --> 00:20:16,133
OUR GIRL'S BACK.

396
00:20:17,885 --> 00:20:20,929
I JUST WANTED YOU
TO BE PROUD BEFORE

397
00:20:21,013 --> 00:20:24,016
OF HOW BRAVE
AND PERFECT I WAS.

398
00:20:24,099 --> 00:20:27,227
AFTER EVERYTHING HAPPENED
AND RICK DIED...

399
00:20:27,311 --> 00:20:29,188
I COULDN'T HOLD ON
TO IT ANYMORE.

400
00:20:29,271 --> 00:20:31,982
YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE
BRAVE OR PERFECT EVER.

401
00:20:32,065 --> 00:20:33,025
JUST BE YOU.

402
00:20:35,736 --> 00:20:37,863
BUT WHAT IF I DON'T LIKE ME
VERY MUCH RIGHT NOW?

403
00:20:43,702 --> 00:20:46,455
I NEED SOMEBODY
TO TAKE ME TO THE CLINIC.

404
00:20:46,538 --> 00:20:49,791
ARE YOU SICK?
DO YOU HAVE A FEVER?

405
00:20:51,585 --> 00:20:53,545
I JUST NEED TO GO
TO THE HEALTH UNIT.

406
00:20:53,629 --> 00:20:54,880
TOMORROW.

407
00:20:56,256 --> 00:20:58,217
SIMPSON:
THERE'S SOMETHING GOING
AROUND THE SCHOOL RIGHT NOW,

408
00:20:58,300 --> 00:21:01,094
BUT IT WAS A VERY
SPECIFIC GROUP,

409
00:21:02,346 --> 00:21:04,223
AND EM,
IF YOU'RE WORRIED

410
00:21:04,306 --> 00:21:05,724
THERE'S A GOOD CHANCE
YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE.

411
00:21:07,434 --> 00:21:08,060
I HAVE TO BE.

412
00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:11,772
SPIKE:
EMMA?

413
00:21:15,067 --> 00:21:17,486
JUST SAY
YOU'LL TAKE ME.

414
00:21:17,569 --> 00:21:18,904
JUST SAY.
