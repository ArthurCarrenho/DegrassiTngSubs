00:03:07,771 --> 00:03:09,523

ON SUBLIMINAL MESSAGES

OKAY, SO.

80
00:03:21,952 --> 00:03:25,330
IN THE EARLY 1950'S,
AN ADVERTISING EXPERT

81
00:03:25,414 --> 00:03:28,834
BY THE NAME OF JAMES VICARY
WALKED INTO A MOVIE THEATRE...

82
00:03:34,339 --> 00:03:37,009

00:03:37,092 --> 00:03:40,512

CALLING IT THESE DAYS?

YOU'RE NOT CRIPPLED,
OKAY?

101
00:04:12,586 --> 00:04:15,047
I GUESS I WON'T BE

102
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:16,798
JUST LIKE I IMAGINE
THAT YOU AND ASHLEY

103
00:04:16,882 --> 00:04:19,092
WON'T JUST BE FRIENDS
FOR LONG EITHER.

104
00:04:20,928 --> 00:04:22,054
WHAT, DID YOU GET
BRAIN DAMAGE, TOO?

105
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:28,560
ASHLEY AND I ARE NOT GOING
TO HAPPEN AGAIN.

106
00:04:28,644 --> 00:04:29,895
WHATEVER.

107
00:04:31,313 --> 00:04:32,564

THAT UM...

157
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:55,999

159
00:06:59,753 --> 00:07:01,046
ANYWAYS, I WAS
JUST WALKING BY

160
00:07:01,129 --> 00:07:04,341
THOUGHT I'D COME SAY HI
TO MY FAVORITE YOGA STUDENT.

161
00:07:07,052 --> 00:07:07,970
YOU SHOULD GO FOR IT.

162
00:07:08,053 --> 00:07:08,929
WHAT?!

163
00:07:09,012 --> 00:07:10,681

MANNY:
THERE IS NO SUCH THING
AS BAD PUBLICITY,

166
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,526

AS A BAD SHIRT.

167
00:07:23,861 --> 00:07:25,279
I COULDN'T AGREE
WITH YOU MORE.

168

I DON'T KNOW
WHY WE BOTHER

171
00:07:30,242 --> 00:07:32,369

WE'RE JUST THE BACK-UP BAND

172

VARIETY HOUR.

00:07:38,876 --> 00:07:39,585
IT'S LIKE...

176
00:07:39,668 --> 00:07:41,670
YOU AND I
AREN'T EVEN IN THE BAND.

177
00:07:41,753 --> 00:07:42,796
ASHLEY:

208
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:45,692
CRAIG:

209
00:08:45,776 --> 00:08:48,195
MARCO:

00:08:48,278 --> 00:08:48,987
CRAIG:
OKAY.

211
00:08:49,071 --> 00:08:50,405
SO LET'S TALK.

212
00:08:50,489 --> 00:08:51,532
SPINNER:
ASH HAS GOTTA GO.

213
00:08:51,615 --> 00:08:54,326
WHOA, STIX,
HEY SLOW IT DOWN.

214
00:08:55,118 --> 00:08:57,079
ASH HAS GOTTA GO.

215
00:08:57,621 --> 00:08:58,956
CRAIG:
HAS EVERYONE GONE NUTS?

216
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:00,165
MARCO:
SHE'S NOT IN THE BAND, CRAIG.

217
00:09:00,249 --> 00:09:01,875
WE NEVER AGREED TO IT.

218
00:09:01,959 --> 00:09:03,043
YES YOU DID.

219
00:09:03,126 --> 00:09:04,878
SPINNER:
DUDE, IT USED TO BE OUR BAND.

220
00:09:04,962 --> 00:09:08,048
REMEMBER?
IT USED TO BE ABOUT US.

221
00:09:08,131 --> 00:09:09,466
IT'S STILL ABOUT US.

222
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:11,385
ASH LOST THE CONTEST,
OKAY?

223
00:09:11,468 --> 00:09:13,053
TO US AND TO JIMMY.

224
00:09:14,137 --> 00:09:17,683
SO WHY DOES SHE GET
TO BE ON THE RECORDING?

225
00:09:17,766 --> 00:09:20,018
LOOK, RECORDING THIS SINGLE

226
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:22,938
IT MEANS EVERYTHING TO ME,
OKAY?

227
00:09:23,021 --> 00:09:24,690
SPINNER:
DUDE...

228
00:09:24,773 --> 00:09:26,233
EITHER SHE GOES OR WE DO,
OKAY?

229
00:09:26,316 --> 00:09:28,318
'CAUSE IT'S NOT WORKING.

230
00:09:29,319 --> 00:09:31,613
YOU HAVE TO FIRE HER.

231
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:39,204
(SIGHS)

232
00:09:44,418 --> 00:09:45,919
REMEMBER
THE RECORDING SESSION?

233
00:09:46,003 --> 00:09:47,004
UM HI.

234
00:09:47,671 --> 00:09:48,797

235
00:09:48,881 --> 00:09:50,299
YEAH, UM...

236
00:09:52,009 --> 00:09:53,468
I DON'T KNOW HOW
TO TELL YOU THIS-

237
00:09:53,552 --> 00:09:55,512
HEY LOOK.
I'M NERVOUS, TOO.

238
00:09:55,596 --> 00:09:57,097
BUT I MEAN,
YOU'LL BE THERE.

239
00:09:57,181 --> 00:09:58,932
YOU KNOW, ALL I HAVE TO DO
IS LOOK OVER AT YOU,

240
00:09:59,016 --> 00:10:00,934
AND I'LL BE FINE.

241
00:10:01,643 --> 00:10:04,980
SO, YOU WANTED
TO TELL ME SOMETHING?

242
00:10:13,906 --> 00:10:14,656
UH...

243
00:10:29,796 --> 00:10:31,423
MARCO:
LOOK, YOU DID THE RIGHT THING,
OKAY?

244
00:10:31,507 --> 00:10:33,258
I'M SURE IT WAS PAINFUL
FOR YOU AND ASH,

245
00:10:33,342 --> 00:10:36,053
BUT HEY, AT LEAST US GUYS
CAN BE US GUYS AGAIN.

246
00:10:36,136 --> 00:10:36,803
PAINFUL?

247
00:10:37,513 --> 00:10:40,682
THE OPPOSITE.
ASHLEY AND I... WE'RE BACK!

248
00:10:43,143 --> 00:10:45,312
WE'RE BACK TOGETHER!

249
00:10:46,647 --> 00:10:48,565
OH GEE, I THOUGHT SHE
WOULD'VE BEEN ALL MAD

250
00:10:48,649 --> 00:10:50,234
WHEN YOU FIRED HER.

251
00:10:50,943 --> 00:10:51,902
MARCO:
UH, YEAH.

252
00:10:51,985 --> 00:10:53,403
HE DIDN'T FIRE HER,
SPINNER.

253
00:10:54,696 --> 00:10:56,823
CRAIG:
LIKE I COULD KISS HER
AND THEN DO IT.

254
00:10:56,907 --> 00:10:57,574
COME ON.

255
00:10:58,450 --> 00:11:00,702
MARCO, CUT ME SOME SLACK.

256
00:11:00,786 --> 00:11:03,872
COME ON.
IT'S NOT THAT BIG OF A DEAL!

257
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:08,460
MATT:
EXTEND THE CROWN OF YOUR HEAD

258
00:11:10,462 --> 00:11:12,047
AND BREATHE DEEPLY.

259
00:11:13,715 --> 00:11:14,633
GOOD. GOOD.

260
00:11:23,851 --> 00:11:26,019
YOU'RE A NATURAL,
HEATHER.

261
00:11:27,855 --> 00:11:28,522
PERFECT.

262
00:11:31,525 --> 00:11:32,943
PAIGE:
HE DIDN'T EVEN LOOK AT ME!

263
00:11:33,026 --> 00:11:33,652
ALL HE COULD LOOK AT

264
00:11:33,735 --> 00:11:35,487
WERE HEATHER SINCLAIR'S
TRASHY ROOTS

265
00:11:35,571 --> 00:11:36,572
AND HER BIG,
ROUND-

266
00:11:36,655 --> 00:11:38,448
NOT TO SOUND
LIKE A BROKEN RECORD,

267
00:11:38,532 --> 00:11:40,409
BUT HE IS A TEACHER.

268
00:11:40,492 --> 00:11:41,410
HOW AM I SUPPOSED
TO GO FOR IT

269
00:11:41,493 --> 00:11:42,619
IF HE WON'T EVEN
LOOK AT ME?

270
00:11:42,703 --> 00:11:43,871
HAZEL:
MAYBE YOU SHOULDN'T GO FOR IT.

271
00:11:43,954 --> 00:11:45,831
YOU AND OLDER GUYS
ARE NOT ALWAYS A GOOD MATCH.

272
00:11:45,914 --> 00:11:46,248
SHH!

273
00:11:46,999 --> 00:11:48,834

280
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,265
ELLIE:
DON'T DO IT.

281
00:12:04,433 --> 00:12:06,226
ASHLEY:
YEAH, LITTLE LATE FOR THAT.

282
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:08,562
ELLIE:
NOT THE KISS. THE REST.

283
00:12:08,645 --> 00:12:11,815
ASHLEY:
WELL, HE'S DIFFERENT.
I THINK.

284
00:12:12,941 --> 00:12:15,027
ELLIE:
GUYS SUCK, ASHLEY.

285
00:12:16,612 --> 00:12:18,363
THEY ENJOY MESSING
WITH OUR FEELINGS

286
00:12:18,447 --> 00:12:19,823
AND THEN STICKING US
WITH THE RENT.

287
00:12:20,866 --> 00:12:22,576
JUST DON'T COME CRYING
TO ME

288
00:12:22,659 --> 00:12:24,953
WHEN HE "CRAIGS OUT"
ON YOU.

289
00:12:33,170 --> 00:12:34,129
EVERYTHING OKAY?

290
00:12:34,213 --> 00:12:36,715

291
00:12:36,798 --> 00:12:37,549
YEAH, I JUST,
I FIGURED

292
00:12:37,633 --> 00:12:39,760
WE SHOULD TALK

293
00:12:39,843 --> 00:12:41,053
ABOUT YESTERDAY.

294
00:12:41,136 --> 00:12:42,137
RIGHT.

295
00:12:43,263 --> 00:12:44,389
OKAY.

296
00:12:44,473 --> 00:12:46,141

299
00:12:51,605 --> 00:12:52,564
YOU KNOW,
MAYBE WE'RE JUST UH...

300
00:12:52,648 --> 00:12:54,233
REACHING FOR SOMETHING
FAMILIAR.

301
00:12:54,316 --> 00:12:56,735
YOU KNOW, GIVEN JIMMY,
EVERYTHING THAT'S HAPPENED.

302
00:12:56,818 --> 00:12:59,404
OH. NEVER THOUGHT
OF THAT.

303
00:12:59,488 --> 00:13:03,200
WELL, YOU KNOW, WE HAVE BEEN
DOING GREAT AS FRIENDS, RIGHT?

304
00:13:03,283 --> 00:13:04,284
RIGHT.

305
00:13:04,993 --> 00:13:06,912
AND WHO'D WANT
TO SCREW THAT UP?

306
00:13:06,995 --> 00:13:08,830
YEAH. WHO WOULD?

307
00:13:09,581 --> 00:13:11,750
GOOD. GREAT. GOOD.

308
00:13:11,834 --> 00:13:13,585
I'M GLAD WE GOT
THAT SETTLED.

00:13:21,176 --> 00:13:22,219
I HOPE THEY HAVE YOGA

312
00:13:23,011 --> 00:13:24,513
WE'RE NOT GOING TO JAIL,
OKAY?

313
00:13:24,596 --> 00:13:25,848
OUR I.D. IS SUPER GOOD.

314
00:13:25,931 --> 00:13:28,267
I SWEAR DYLAN'S DORMMATE'S
IN THE MAFIA.

315
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:29,226
SO WE'LL BE IN JAIL

316
00:13:29,309 --> 00:13:31,270
