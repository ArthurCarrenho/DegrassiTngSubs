THERE'S PEOPLE

160
00:06:32,809 --> 00:06:35,854

IT'S GOING

164
00:06:43,362 --> 00:06:45,239

I'M SORRY,
I SHOULD'VE LISTENED TO YOU.

169
00:06:58,335 --> 00:07:00,170
IT WAS A HUGE MISTAKE.

170
00:07:00,254 --> 00:07:00,963
IF I COULD GO BACK...

171
00:07:01,046 --> 00:07:02,548
DO YOU HAVE A POINT?

172
00:07:02,631 --> 00:07:04,550
WHY GO THROUGH THIS?

173
00:07:04,633 --> 00:07:07,094
YOU COULD TELL THEM
YOU DON'T WANT TO TESTIFY,

174
00:07:07,177 --> 00:07:08,095
SKIP IT.

175
00:07:08,178 --> 00:07:09,096
IT'D BE THAT EASY.

176
00:07:09,179 --> 00:07:12,099

OKAY. BUT...

181
00:07:23,277 --> 00:07:25,279
YOU'LL THINK ABOUT IT,
RIGHT?

182
00:07:25,362 --> 00:07:26,405
I MEAN, MAYBE
WE NEVER SEE

183
00:07:26,488 --> 00:07:27,614
EACH OTHER AGAIN.

184
00:07:27,698 --> 00:07:29,950

SORRY. I BELIEVE
I WAS ABDUCTED BY ALIENS

189
00:08:05,319 --> 00:08:07,821

WEEKEND.

190
00:08:07,905 --> 00:08:10,574
AND TOWERZ AND I

191
00:08:11,158 --> 00:08:11,658

192
00:08:15,412 --> 00:08:16,622
MORNING, ELLIE!

193
00:08:16,705 --> 00:08:17,623
HEY, PAIGE.

194
00:08:19,208 --> 00:08:20,250
GREAT OUTFIT.

NEW YEAR, NEW LOOK,

196
00:08:22,503 --> 00:08:23,712
ELLIE.
JUST BECAUSE PRINCESS PISSY

00:08:23,795 --> 00:08:24,296
TALKS TO YOU,

198
00:08:24,379 --> 00:08:25,756
DOESN'T MEAN YOU
HAVE TO ANSWER.

199
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:28,091
I'M GOING,
I'M GOING.

200
00:08:30,093 --> 00:08:32,262
AS USUAL,
GLAD WE'RE GUYS.

201
00:08:33,138 --> 00:08:33,972
(CHUCKLES)

202
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:36,975
OH MY GOD,
THEY'RE SO CUTE!

203
00:08:37,059 --> 00:08:38,185
REMEMBER WHEN WE WERE
THAT AFRAID

204
00:08:38,268 --> 00:08:39,061
OF DEGRASSI?

205
00:08:39,144 --> 00:08:40,687
REMEMBER WHEN WE WERE
THAT SHORT?

206
00:08:40,771 --> 00:08:43,023
REMEMBER WHERE
THE PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE IS?

207
00:08:43,106 --> 00:08:45,067
UH, YEAH.
IT'S DOWNSTAIRS,

208
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:46,860
THROUGH THE FOYER
AND TO THE LEFT.

209
00:08:46,944 --> 00:08:47,945
GOOD.
GO ON DOWN.

210
00:08:48,028 --> 00:08:48,862
I NEED SPEND
TIME ALONE

211
00:08:48,946 --> 00:08:50,656
WITH YOUR GIRLFRIEND.

212
00:09:03,919 --> 00:09:04,503
ASHLEY?

213
00:09:08,298 --> 00:09:08,966
DID YOU?

214
00:09:12,761 --> 00:09:13,387
NICE GOING, CRAIG.

215
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:16,306
REALLY, UH,
REALLY, REALLY SMOOTH.

216
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:18,517
OH, HEY!
HAPPY BIRTHDAY, BUDDY!

217
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,811
WOW!
YOU HIT THE MALL LATELY?

218
00:09:20,894 --> 00:09:22,229
YOU THINK IT WAS EASY
FINDING THOSE STREAMERS

219
00:09:22,312 --> 00:09:23,647
AND MUSICAL NOTES?

220
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:24,940
NO,
I MEANT YOUR OUTFIT.

221
00:09:25,023 --> 00:09:26,817
YOU LIKE IT?

222
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:28,318
YEAH, MAN, AND UH...

223
00:09:28,402 --> 00:09:29,528
I LOVE THE LOCKER.
THANKS.

224
00:09:29,611 --> 00:09:30,362
NO PROBLEM.

225
00:09:30,445 --> 00:09:32,531
HEY MAN,
YOU DATING ANYBODY?

226
00:09:32,614 --> 00:09:33,574
(GIGGLES)

227
00:09:33,657 --> 00:09:34,575
I'M SERIOUS.

228
00:09:34,658 --> 00:09:35,450
SPINNER:
THINK PAIGE WILL BE MAD

229
00:09:35,534 --> 00:09:37,744
IF I PUT UP A PICTURE
OF MANDY MOORE?

230
00:09:37,828 --> 00:09:39,288
I SAW HER IN L.A.

231
00:09:39,371 --> 00:09:40,163
WHEN THAT SCOUT
WHO LIKED ME

232
00:09:40,247 --> 00:09:43,292
TOOK THE WHOLE CAMP
TO SEE A LAKERS GAME.

233
00:09:43,375 --> 00:09:44,042
ARE YOU LISTENING?

234
00:09:44,126 --> 00:09:46,253
MAYBE HILLARY DUFF
WILL BE BETTER.

235
00:09:46,336 --> 00:09:49,339
WHY?
WHY WOULD THAT BE BETTER?

236
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,258
SHE LOOKS MORE
LIKE PAIGE.

237
00:09:51,341 --> 00:09:54,428
I'D RATHER LOOK LIKE
LINDSEY LOHAN.

238
00:09:54,511 --> 00:09:55,637
AREN'T YOU
AT COURT TODAY?

239
00:09:55,721 --> 00:09:56,805
I ALWAYS WANTED
AN ASSISTANT

240
00:09:56,889 --> 00:09:58,265
TO HANDLE MY CALENDAR,

241
00:09:58,348 --> 00:09:59,349
THANKS JIM.

242
00:09:59,433 --> 00:10:02,769
IT WAS SUPPOSED
TO BE TOMORROW.

243
00:10:02,853 --> 00:10:04,730
WAIT. SUPPOSED?

244
00:10:04,813 --> 00:10:05,981
I'M NOT GOING.

245
00:10:06,648 --> 00:10:07,858
DON'T REALLY SEE
THE POINT.

246
00:10:07,941 --> 00:10:09,276
I DO.

247
00:10:09,359 --> 00:10:11,195
OKAY.
THEN YOU CAN GO.

248
00:10:12,571 --> 00:10:14,990
YOU - YOU'RE REALLY-
YOU'RE NOT GOING?

249
00:10:15,073 --> 00:10:15,490
NOPE.

250
00:10:19,203 --> 00:10:21,288
I CAN'T DO
THIS ANY MORE.

251
00:10:21,371 --> 00:10:22,623
DO WHAT ANY MORE?

252
00:10:22,706 --> 00:10:23,123
THIS.

253
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:25,876
US.

254
00:10:28,378 --> 00:10:30,339
WHAT WAS THAT?

255
00:10:30,422 --> 00:10:31,840
DID HE JUST DUMP ME?

256
00:10:34,343 --> 00:10:35,010
SPINNER!

257
00:10:35,928 --> 00:10:36,428
GAVIN!

258
00:10:37,763 --> 00:10:38,889
HONEYBEE!

259
00:10:38,972 --> 00:10:39,431
YOU SAID:

260
00:10:39,515 --> 00:10:41,350
"EVERYTHING WOULD BE OKAY,"
PAIGE,

261
00:10:41,433 --> 00:10:42,684
"AFTER THE TRIAL."

262
00:10:42,768 --> 00:10:44,895
I DON'T NEED
THE TRIAL.

263
00:10:44,978 --> 00:10:46,438
LOOK,
IT WAS ONE NIGHT,

264
00:10:46,522 --> 00:10:48,774
ALMOST THREE YEARS AGO.
I'VE MOVED ON.

265
00:10:48,857 --> 00:10:50,692
YOU KNOW I HAVE.

266
00:10:52,736 --> 00:10:56,073
LOOK, LET'S GO PARK
SOMEPLACE.

267
00:10:56,156 --> 00:10:58,534
TONIGHT, OKAY?
JUST US.

268
00:11:01,078 --> 00:11:02,412
GUESS I'D SET
A PRETTY BAD EXAMPLE

269
00:11:02,496 --> 00:11:04,831
IF I TURNED
THAT DOWN.

270
00:11:09,127 --> 00:11:10,420
CAITLIN:
HEY CRAIG.

271
00:11:10,504 --> 00:11:12,256
IT'S USUALLY
A BIG LOAD OF IT

272
00:11:12,339 --> 00:11:14,049
WHEN SO-CALLED GROWN-UPS
GIVE YOU

273
00:11:14,132 --> 00:11:16,927
THAT "THESE ARE THE BEST
YEARS OF YOUR LIFE" STUFF.

274
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:19,388
BUT, UM, MY WISH FOR YOU,
CRAIG,

275
00:11:19,471 --> 00:11:21,056

00:11:40,701 --> 00:11:42,160
CRAIG IS RIGHT.

285
00:11:42,244 --> 00:11:44,204
CAKE WILL HAVE TO WAIT.

286
00:11:48,876 --> 00:11:50,210

287
00:11:51,545 --> 00:11:53,297

I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU
DID THIS!

292
00:12:12,608 --> 00:12:13,775
NO, CRAIG, I DIDN'T.

293
00:12:13,859 --> 00:12:15,611
CRAIG:

294
00:12:15,694 --> 00:12:18,071
THIS IS FROM
MY DAD'S ESTATE?

295
00:12:18,572 --> 00:12:20,782
HE SPECIFIED IT
AS A BIRTHDAY GIFT.

296
00:12:20,866 --> 00:12:21,867
I GUESS TO TIDE

SHHH!

309
00:13:02,616 --> 00:13:05,869
SPINNER:

DID I DO IT WRONG?

310
00:13:07,079 --> 00:13:07,579
SORRY.

311
00:13:23,262 --> 00:13:24,513

HEY, COME ON.

316
00:13:33,856 --> 00:13:35,649
YOU'RE OKAY.

317
00:13:35,732 --> 00:13:38,068
I'M NOT!
I'M NOT OKAY!

318
00:13:40,737 --> 00:13:41,905
PAIGE...

319
00:13:46,493 --> 00:13:48,328
I HAVE TO DO IT.

320
00:13:50,205 --> 00:13:51,832
I HAVE TO GO.

321
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:54,543
I'LL GO WITH YOU.

322
00:14:04,469 --> 00:14:06,138
I UNDERSTAND....

323
00:14:08,015 --> 00:14:09,183
YEAH, BUT LAST WEEK
DOESN'T HELP ME

324
00:14:09,266 --> 00:14:10,601
WITH THIS WEEK.

325
00:14:10,684 --> 00:14:11,435
RADITCH:
I DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE
I CAN TELL YOU

326
00:14:11,518 --> 00:14:13,020
THE BOARD DIDN'T
GIVE ME THE FUNDS

327
00:14:13,103 --> 00:14:16,607
IN ORDER NEW BOOKS
UNTIL A WEEK AGO.

328
00:14:17,691 --> 00:14:19,860
THOSE ARE BACKWARDS.

329
00:14:21,111 --> 00:14:22,196
THANKS.

330
00:14:23,155 --> 00:14:23,780
LISTEN,

331
00:14:23,864 --> 00:14:25,824
I DIDN'T MEAN
TO BE ALL WEIRD YESTERDAY.

332
00:14:25,908 --> 00:14:28,118
NO, YOU WEREN'T WEIRD.
YOU JUST IGNORED ME.

333
00:14:28,202 --> 00:14:30,037
WHICH, I GUESS,
IS SORT OF BEING WEIRD.

334
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:32,080
BUT... BUT NOT.

335
00:14:32,164 --> 00:14:33,165
SORRY.

336
00:14:34,833 --> 00:14:36,960
NOW I'M BEING WEIRD.

337
00:14:37,044 --> 00:14:38,128
LOOK...

338
00:14:39,963 --> 00:14:41,089
I WAS HOPING
WE COULD BE FRIENDS,

339
00:14:41,173 --> 00:14:42,549
BUT AS SOON
AS I SAW YOU-

340
00:14:42,633 --> 00:14:43,884
YOU GOT SUCKED INTO

341
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:47,554
SOME BIZARRO
LAST-YEAR TIME WARP?

342
00:14:47,638 --> 00:14:48,555
YEAH.

343
00:14:49,765 --> 00:14:51,683
SO...
GOOD BIRTHDAY?

344
00:14:51,767 --> 00:14:52,684
ALSO WEIRD.

345
00:14:52,768 --> 00:14:53,644
WEIRD-GOOD?

346
00:14:53,727 --> 00:14:54,686
WELL, MY FREAK
OF A DAD

347
00:14:54,770 --> 00:14:56,104
LEFT ME THIS CHEQUE
FOR TEN GRAND

348
00:14:56,188 --> 00:14:57,689
IN HIS WILL.

349
00:14:58,941 --> 00:15:00,275
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

350
00:15:00,359 --> 00:15:02,402
CRAIG:
YEAH, THE GUY'S
HALF-EATEN BY WORMS

351
00:15:02,486 --> 00:15:03,820
AND HE'S STILL TRYING
TO BUY ME.

352
00:15:03,904 --> 00:15:05,822
IT'S PATHETIC.

353
00:15:05,906 --> 00:15:06,865
HEY, YOUR DAD OWES YOU.

354
00:15:06,949 --> 00:15:09,159
MAYBE HE WAS JUST TRYING
TO MAKE IT UP A LITTLE.

355
00:15:09,243 --> 00:15:10,452
WELL, JOEY GAVE ME
THIS LECTURE

356
00:15:10,536 --> 00:15:11,995

357
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:13,539
BLAH, BLAH, BLAH.

358
00:15:13,622 --> 00:15:16,333
BUT... I'M GONNA RIP
THE CHEQUE UP.

359
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:16,834
I DON'T WANT IT.

360
00:15:16,917 --> 00:15:18,752
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
HOW MUCH FUN

361
00:15:18,836 --> 00:15:21,505
YOU COULD HAVE
WITH THAT MUCH MONEY?

362
00:15:21,588 --> 00:15:23,006
(DOOR BANGS SHUT)

363
00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:24,508
ARMSTRONG:
ALL RIGHT...

364
00:15:24,591 --> 00:15:25,634
GRADE ELEVEN.

365
00:15:26,385 --> 00:15:27,803
TIME TO START
REALLY PREPARING YOU

366
00:15:27,886 --> 00:15:29,555
FOR UNIVERSITY MATH.

367
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:38,605
THANKS FOR BEING HERE TODAY,
MOM.

368
00:15:38,689 --> 00:15:40,399
OH, HONEY,
WHERE ELSE WOULD I BE?

369
00:15:40,482 --> 00:15:41,817
YOU'RE GOING TO DO GREAT
IN THERE.

370
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:46,363
I JUST WANT THIS
ALL TO END.

371
00:15:46,446 --> 00:15:47,656
I KNOW.

372
00:15:47,739 --> 00:15:48,866
AND IT WILL.

373
00:15:48,949 --> 00:15:50,200
WHEN HE GOES
TO JAIL.

374
00:15:50,284 --> 00:15:51,159
MRS. MICHALCHUK:
REMEMBER WHAT
WE TALKED ABOUT

375
00:15:51,243 --> 00:15:52,452
IN COUNSELING,
PAIGEY,

376
00:15:52,536 --> 00:15:54,496
ABOUT WHY WE'RE
DOING THIS?

377
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:55,789
SO YOU COULD GET
SOME CLOSURE;

378
00:15:55,873 --> 00:15:57,291
FEEL HEARD.

379
00:16:00,210 --> 00:16:01,962
SPINNER:
PAIGE!

380
00:16:04,173 --> 00:16:05,799
HEY, PAIGE!
HEY, MRS. MICHALCHUK!

381
00:16:05,883 --> 00:16:07,467
HELLO, GAVIN.

382
00:16:11,513 --> 00:16:14,474
IGNORE HIM.
HE CAN'T HURT YOU.

383
00:16:14,558 --> 00:16:15,559
MORNING ALL.

384
00:16:17,978 --> 00:16:19,396
ROSE, COULD I ACTUALLY
HAVE A MINUTE, PLEASE?

385
00:16:19,479 --> 00:16:21,190
YOU'LL BE OKAY?

386
00:16:24,735 --> 00:16:26,570
I HATE THAT GUY.

387
00:16:27,946 --> 00:16:29,865
YOU SHOULD GO HOME,
SPIN.

388
00:16:29,948 --> 00:16:31,617
I DON'T WANT YOU
HEARING ALL OF THIS.

389
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:33,994
I KNOW WHAT HAPPENED.

390
00:16:34,828 --> 00:16:37,080
NOT THE DETAILS.

391
00:16:37,164 --> 00:16:39,875
WHEN YOU HEAR THEM?
PICTURE IT?

392
00:16:39,958 --> 00:16:41,752
IT'LL KEEP PLAYING
ON THE VCR

393
00:16:41,835 --> 00:16:42,586
IN YOUR HEAD.

394
00:16:42,669 --> 00:16:45,923
REWIND-PAUSE-PLAY-
REWIND-PAUSE...

395
00:16:46,006 --> 00:16:47,424
YOU CAN'T STOP IT.

396
00:16:47,508 --> 00:16:49,551
YOU'LL DUMP ME
AND I'LL DIE ALONE,

397
00:16:49,635 --> 00:16:51,261
WITH MY SIX CATS.

398
00:16:51,345 --> 00:16:52,387
PAIGE,

399
00:16:52,471 --> 00:16:54,723
I'LL NEVER DUMP YOU.

400
00:16:54,806 --> 00:16:57,476
HELLO,
YOU DID IT YESTERDAY?

401
00:16:57,559 --> 00:16:59,561
YEAH,
BUT THAT WAS A TEST.

402
00:16:59,645 --> 00:17:01,438
CAN'T DUMP A GIRL
AS COOL AS YOU.

403
00:17:01,522 --> 00:17:05,526
AND YOU JUST BEING HERE
DOING THIS...

404
00:17:05,609 --> 00:17:07,778
IT'S AMAZINGLY COOL.

405
00:17:14,034 --> 00:17:17,287
(SIGHS)
LET'S GET THIS OVER WITH.

406
00:17:22,459 --> 00:17:23,627
DEFENSE ATTORNEY:
MISS MICHALCHUK,

407
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:25,629
DID YOU GO UPSTAIRS
WILLINGLY WITH MY CLIENT?

408
00:17:25,712 --> 00:17:29,258
DID YOU NOT,
IN FACT, SUGGEST IT?

409
00:17:29,341 --> 00:17:30,467
YEAH.

410
00:17:30,551 --> 00:17:32,636
WHY'D YOU DO THAT?

411
00:17:32,719 --> 00:17:35,013
I... JUST THOUGHT WE-

412
00:17:35,097 --> 00:17:37,224
DEFENSE ATTORNEY:
WHAT? PLAY PINOCHLE?
CRAZY EIGHTS?

413
00:17:37,307 --> 00:17:38,809
OBJECTION, YOUR HONOUR.

414
00:17:38,892 --> 00:17:41,103
PLEASE REPHRASE
THE QUESTION.

415
00:17:41,186 --> 00:17:42,521
WHAT WERE YOUR INTENTIONS,
MISS MICHALCHUK,

416
00:17:42,604 --> 00:17:45,148
IN GOING UP
TO THAT ROOM?

417
00:17:45,232 --> 00:17:47,484
I JUST THOUGHT
WE WOULD BE ALONE TOGETHER.

418
00:17:47,568 --> 00:17:50,904
AND YOU FIND MY CLIENT
ATTRACTIVE?

419
00:17:53,907 --> 00:17:54,658
YES.

420
00:17:56,577 --> 00:17:57,578
I DID.

421
00:17:58,287 --> 00:17:59,329
BEFORE.

422
00:17:59,413 --> 00:18:00,122
WHEN MY CLIENT
PUT HIS HAND

423
00:18:00,205 --> 00:18:00,914
INSIDE YOUR BLOUSE,

424
00:18:00,998 --> 00:18:03,292
DID YOU IMMEDIATELY
REJECT HIM?

425
00:18:03,375 --> 00:18:04,710
SLAP HIM?!

426
00:18:06,003 --> 00:18:08,589
FOR THE RECORD,
PLEASE?

427
00:18:08,672 --> 00:18:09,423
NO.

428
00:18:11,884 --> 00:18:14,136
THIS IS VERY DIFFICULT
FOR YOU, I KNOW,

429
00:18:14,219 --> 00:18:16,221
BUT WHEN MY CLIENT
TOUCHED YOUR BREAST,

430
00:18:16,305 --> 00:18:18,307
HOW DID YOU RESPOND?

431
00:18:18,390 --> 00:18:20,309
DID YOU ENJOY IT?

432
00:18:21,101 --> 00:18:21,810
NO.

433
00:18:25,439 --> 00:18:27,691
WELL, AT FIRST,
YEAH.

434
00:18:29,109 --> 00:18:30,736
DEFENSE ATTORNEY:
YOU'RE TELLING US
THAT YOU DID.

435
00:18:30,819 --> 00:18:31,862
MISS MICHALCHUK,

436
00:18:31,945 --> 00:18:33,447
DID MY CLIENT EVER HOLD
A GUN TO YOUR HEAD,

437
00:18:33,530 --> 00:18:34,907
A KNIFE TO YOUR THROAT,

438
00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:35,824
A GRENADE?

439
00:18:36,450 --> 00:18:36,658
NO.

440
00:18:36,742 --> 00:18:38,660
DEFENSE ATTORNEY:
DID HE NOT,
IN FACT, WEAR A CONDOM?

441
00:18:38,744 --> 00:18:40,454
YEAH,
BUT THAT DOESN'T MAKE HIM-

442
00:18:40,537 --> 00:18:41,163
DEFENSE ATTORNEY:
YOU COULD SHOW ME

443
00:18:41,246 --> 00:18:42,873
HOW HE MANAGED TO OPEN
ONE OF THESE

444
00:18:42,956 --> 00:18:45,167
AND ROLLED IT
ONTO HIS PENIS

445
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:45,959
WITHOUT OFFERING YOU

446
00:18:46,043 --> 00:18:49,713
A CHANCE TO GET AWAY
IF YOU WANTED TO?

447
00:18:50,464 --> 00:18:51,798
I SAID NO!

448
00:18:52,341 --> 00:18:54,885
BUT HE IS BIGGER
THAN ME,

449
00:18:56,053 --> 00:18:57,554
STRONGER.

450
00:18:57,638 --> 00:18:59,264
I WAS AFRAID.

451
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:01,725
I'M NOT SURE.

452
00:19:01,808 --> 00:19:04,770
DEFENSE ATTORNEY:
OH! SO YOU DON'T KNOW.

453
00:19:04,853 --> 00:19:05,979
HOW MANY MEN
HAVE YOU HAD SEX WITH,

454
00:19:06,063 --> 00:19:07,356
MISS MICHALCHUK?

455
00:19:07,439 --> 00:19:08,065
OBJECTION.

456
00:19:08,148 --> 00:19:09,691
PAIGE:
ACTUALLY,

457
00:19:09,775 --> 00:19:12,069
I'D LIKE TO ANSWER THAT.

458
00:19:12,152 --> 00:19:14,696
THAT WAS MY ONLY
EXPERIENCE.

459
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:16,990
AND I CERTAINLY WOULD
NOT HAVE CHOSEN

460
00:19:17,074 --> 00:19:18,575
TO LOSE MY VIRGINITY

461
00:19:18,659 --> 00:19:20,827
UPSTAIRS AT A HOUSE PARTY

462
00:19:20,911 --> 00:19:24,164
WITH A GUY
I'D KNOWN FOR AN HOUR.

463
00:19:44,351 --> 00:19:45,602
20 SETS OF HANDMAIDS?

464
00:19:45,686 --> 00:19:47,104
JACK WHITE DOESN'T GO THROUGH
THAT MANY STRINGS

465
00:19:47,187 --> 00:19:47,980
IN A YEAR.

466
00:19:48,063 --> 00:19:50,148
MAYBE HE SHOULD.

467
00:19:50,232 --> 00:19:51,066
AWW!

468
00:19:51,942 --> 00:19:52,985
HOW 'BOUT THIS?

469
00:19:53,068 --> 00:19:55,279
LEGENDARY CRY BABY
WAA WAA.

470
00:19:55,362 --> 00:19:56,363
I THOUGHT IT ALREADY
MADE YOU

471
00:19:56,446 --> 00:19:58,073
CRY ENOUGH
LAST YEAR.

472
00:19:58,156 --> 00:19:59,533
WAA, WAA, WAA.

473
00:19:59,616 --> 00:20:01,034
CRAIG!
UGH!

474
00:20:02,578 --> 00:20:05,956
SORRY, WOW,
THAT WAS REALLY STUPID.

475
00:20:11,086 --> 00:20:14,089
ASHLEY:
HOW BEAUTIFUL IS THIS?

476
00:20:19,803 --> 00:20:21,305
IS THAT A 62'
STRATOCASTER?

477
00:20:21,388 --> 00:20:22,931
UH, 69'.

478
00:20:23,015 --> 00:20:24,433
MASTER-BUILT AMERICAN.

479
00:20:24,516 --> 00:20:26,351
SUNBURST FINISH.
CLASSIC.

480
00:20:26,435 --> 00:20:27,936
ROSEWOOD FRETBOARD.

481
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:30,355
THREE-WAY SWITCH
WITH PHASING?

482
00:20:30,439 --> 00:20:32,733
UH... IT'S GOT
ALL THE ORIGINAL HARDWARE.

483
00:20:32,816 --> 00:20:34,776
I FEEL LIKE
I'M IN CHURCH.

484
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:35,861
YOU THINK YOU COULD
PUT THAT BACK NOW?

485
00:20:35,944 --> 00:20:37,070
IT'S WORTH OVER
FOUR GRAND.

486
00:20:37,154 --> 00:20:38,238
I'LL TAKE IT.

487
00:20:41,783 --> 00:20:43,452
MY DAD WOULD HATE IT.

488
00:20:43,535 --> 00:20:44,703
PERFECT.

489
00:20:45,954 --> 00:20:46,747
YEP.

490
00:20:47,998 --> 00:20:50,000
BAILIFF:
ALL RISE!

491
00:20:50,751 --> 00:20:51,960
IT'S GOOD THAT
SHE'S READY

492
00:20:52,044 --> 00:20:53,587
FOR THE VERDICT ALREADY,
RIGHT?

493
00:20:53,670 --> 00:20:54,463
SURE. YEAH,
SURE, IT IS.

494
00:20:54,546 --> 00:20:56,632
BAILIFF:
BE SEATED.

495
00:21:02,137 --> 00:21:04,723
MISS MICHALCHUK'S TESTIMONY
WAS EXTREMELY COMPELLING

496
00:21:04,806 --> 00:21:07,059
AND I WANT TO APPLAUD HER
FOR HAVING THE COURAGE

497
00:21:07,142 --> 00:21:07,893
AND THE STRENGTH

498
00:21:07,976 --> 00:21:10,896
FOR DOING WHAT SHE DID
HERE TODAY.

499
00:21:10,979 --> 00:21:11,396
IT'S THE KIND OF CASE

500
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:12,981
THAT KEEPS ME AWAKE
AT NIGHT

501
00:21:13,065 --> 00:21:13,941
BECAUSE IT'S NOT
THE KIND

502
00:21:14,024 --> 00:21:17,444
A JUSTICE IN MY POSITION
WANTS TO HEAR.

503
00:21:17,528 --> 00:21:19,238
GIVEN THAT THERE
ARE NO EYEWITNESSES

504
00:21:19,321 --> 00:21:20,989
AND NO PHYSICAL EVIDENCE,

505
00:21:21,073 --> 00:21:25,077
I HAVE NO CHOICE
BUT TO FIND THE DEFENDANT...

506
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:25,619
NOT GUILTY.

507
00:21:25,702 --> 00:21:27,287
MR. WALTON,
YOU ARE FREE TO GO.

508
00:21:27,371 --> 00:21:29,665
(MIXED REACTIONS
IN THE COURTROOM)
