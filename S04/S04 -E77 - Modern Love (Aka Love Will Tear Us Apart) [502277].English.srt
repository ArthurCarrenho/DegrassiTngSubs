1
00:00:04,505 --> 00:00:06,256
I WAS FIXATED
ON YOUR EARLOBES

2
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:07,758
FOR MOST OF THE CLASS.

3
00:00:07,841 --> 00:00:11,011
SO MY NANOCOMPUTER
LESSON WAS DULL.

4
00:00:11,094 --> 00:00:13,263
THAT MY EYES WERE EVEN OPEN
IN MEDIA IMMERSION

5
00:00:13,347 --> 00:00:15,015
IS A TESTAMENT TO YOU.

6
00:00:15,098 --> 00:00:17,518
SO STOP WORRYING,
OKAY?

7
00:00:18,227 --> 00:00:19,269
I'M BEING GRADED

8
00:00:19,353 --> 00:00:21,855
ON HOW WELL I HOLD
A CLASS TOMORROW.

9
00:00:21,939 --> 00:00:23,690
THAT'S SCARY.

10
00:00:23,774 --> 00:00:25,692
YOU GUYS ARE SCARY.

11
00:00:25,776 --> 00:00:27,027
MARCO'S NOT SCARY.

12
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:29,029
MARCO'S AFRAID
OF BEES.

13
00:00:29,112 --> 00:00:31,532
HEATHER SINCLAIR -
NOT SCARY.

14
00:00:31,615 --> 00:00:33,742
UNLESS MAYBE YOU SEE HER
IN HER GRANNY PANTIES

15
00:00:33,825 --> 00:00:35,369
AFTER GYM.

16
00:00:35,452 --> 00:00:37,120
THERE'S ALSO
THE TINY FACT

17
00:00:37,204 --> 00:00:40,082
THAT YOU'RE A PHENOMENAL
TEACHER.

18
00:00:40,165 --> 00:00:42,459
SO PLEASE,
FEAR NOT.

19
00:00:44,503 --> 00:00:46,505
YOU'RE SWEET.

20
00:00:46,588 --> 00:00:47,881
AND NOT JUST BECAUSE
YOU MADE LEMON SQUARES.

21
00:00:47,965 --> 00:00:49,049
(BABY CRYING)

22
00:00:52,094 --> 00:00:52,928
THE PARK.

23
00:00:53,011 --> 00:00:54,638
GREAT ROMANCE IDEA,
HON.

24
00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:57,349
POOR KID'S BLINDED BY THE GLARE
OFF HIS DAD'S LEGS.

25
00:00:57,975 --> 00:00:59,268
CAN YOU SAY
WHITER-THAN-WHITE?

26
00:01:01,603 --> 00:01:03,230
YEAH, SIMPSON.

27
00:01:03,313 --> 00:01:04,648
OH MY GOD.

28
00:01:09,444 --> 00:01:10,904
HE DIDN'T SEE US.
NO WAY.

I TOTALLY MISSED
WASHING MY HAIR

41
00:02:07,419 --> 00:02:08,712
TO MAKE IT IN TIME
FOR THIS?

42
00:02:10,297 --> 00:02:13,425
DARCY:
PAIGE SKIPS
PRACTICE AGAIN.

43
00:02:13,884 --> 00:02:15,385
GUYS, LET'S GO
WITH A 3-4-3 START.

44
00:02:15,469 --> 00:02:16,470
READY FOR A RIGHT
HERKIE JUMP.

45
00:02:17,513 --> 00:02:19,223
OKAY. LET'S GO.

46
00:02:22,017 --> 00:02:22,935
JUST SO YOU KNOW,

47
00:02:23,018 --> 00:02:25,812
I AM NOT COOL
WITH YOU TAKING OVER.

48
00:02:25,896 --> 00:02:26,480
PAIGE WON'T CARE.

49
00:02:26,563 --> 00:02:28,690
SHE'S TOO WRAPPED UP IN MATT
TO EVEN NOTICE.

50
00:02:28,774 --> 00:02:31,151
IT'S A CRUSH.
NO BIG THING.

51
00:02:31,235 --> 00:02:31,944
YOU DON'T HAVE TO LIE.

52
00:02:32,027 --> 00:02:34,446
PAIGE TOLD ME ABOUT HER HOT
AFTER-SCHOOL AFFAIR.

53
00:02:37,574 --> 00:02:38,492
OOPS.

54
00:02:39,409 --> 00:02:41,119
I DID IT AGAIN.

55
00:02:44,373 --> 00:02:46,959
MANNY:
ALL RIGHT, GUYS.
LETS GET IT TOGETHER.

56
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:49,586
MATT:
LET'S DISCUSS HOW
THIS CIGARETTE AD

57
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:52,089
TRIES TO MANIPULATE US.

58
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:52,756
ANYONE?

59
00:02:54,299 --> 00:02:56,468
EMMA. LET'S HEAR IT.

60
00:02:59,596 --> 00:03:03,183
OKAY. WELL, I THINK IT'S AIMED
AT A FEMALE DEMOGRAPHIC?

61
00:03:03,267 --> 00:03:04,476
AND I THINK THE TOBACCO
COMPANIES

62
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,145
ARE TRYING TO TELL US
THAT HEALTHY WOMEN CAN SMOKE

63
00:03:07,229 --> 00:03:09,189
BECAUSE SHE'S HIKING
OR WHATEVER.

64
00:03:09,273 --> 00:03:10,023
MATT:
GOOD.

65
00:03:10,107 --> 00:03:12,359
NOW AND IN TERMS OF SUBTLER
MESSAGING,

66
00:03:12,442 --> 00:03:13,694
LIKE WHERE IS SHE?

67
00:03:13,777 --> 00:03:15,612
OR WHERE IS SHE GOING?

68
00:03:15,696 --> 00:03:16,655
I'M LESS SURE.

69
00:03:18,532 --> 00:03:20,951
PROBABLY TO THE RAVINE.

70
00:03:23,287 --> 00:03:24,288
THAT'S ENOUGH,
MR. SHARPE.

71
00:03:26,373 --> 00:03:27,958
WHAT ISN'T THE AD
SHOWING US, EMMA?

72
00:03:29,001 --> 00:03:30,502
ANYTHING NEGATIVE.

73
00:03:31,837 --> 00:03:34,673
UM... LUNG CANCER,
EMPHYSEMA, STROKE.

74
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:37,301
GONORRHEA.

75
00:03:37,384 --> 00:03:39,052
MATT:
OKAY. SEE ME AFTER CLASS.

76
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:40,679
WE'LL HAVE A LESSON
ON RESPECT.

77
00:03:41,305 --> 00:03:42,514
THANK YOU,
MR. OLEANDER.

78
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:47,686
MATT:
OKAY, MOVING ON.

79
00:03:58,155 --> 00:04:00,574
MATT:
NANOTECH IS FINALLY WINNING
THE RESPECT IT DESERVES

80
00:04:00,657 --> 00:04:01,658
AS A SCIENCE.

81
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:04,244
PAIGE.

82
00:04:04,995 --> 00:04:05,829
PAIGE.

83
00:04:05,913 --> 00:04:07,998
SHH! MR. OLEANDER
IS TEACHING.

84
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:11,001
IS MANNY YOUR
NEW BEST FRIEND?

85
00:04:12,044 --> 00:04:14,713
OKAY, CAN WE PLEASE DEAL WITH
WHATEVER YOUR PROBLEM IS LATER,

86
00:04:14,796 --> 00:04:16,215
GREEN-EYED HAZELMONSTER?

87
00:04:16,298 --> 00:04:17,549
MATT:
HAZEL.

88
00:04:17,549 --> 00:04:18,967
CAN I HAVE
YOUR ATTENTION PLEASE?

89
00:04:20,719 --> 00:04:22,471
SHE SPILLED.

90
00:04:22,554 --> 00:04:23,722
ABOUT YOU AND MR. O.

91
00:04:23,805 --> 00:04:24,515
YOU DO KNOW

92
00:04:24,598 --> 00:04:26,683
THAT YOU CAN BE SECRECY
CHALLENGED SOMETIMES, RIGHT?

93
00:04:27,184 --> 00:04:28,477
HOW COULD YOU
NOT TELL ME?

94
00:04:29,353 --> 00:04:30,187
HAZEL. HI.

95
00:04:31,939 --> 00:04:32,689
DIDN'T YOU HEAR ME?

96
00:04:33,482 --> 00:04:34,608
GEE, MR. OLEANDER,

97
00:04:34,691 --> 00:04:36,193
I THOUGHT YOU ONLY HAD
EYES FOR PAIGE.

98
00:04:42,533 --> 00:04:43,367
IS EVERYTHING OKAY?

99
00:04:44,076 --> 00:04:45,285
UH, YEAH.

100
00:04:45,369 --> 00:04:46,787
I'VE JUST UM...

101
00:04:48,205 --> 00:04:49,915
I'VE JUST LOST MY,
LOST MY PLACE.

102
00:04:51,375 --> 00:04:54,294
UM... HOLLYWOOD HAS SEIZED
ON NANOTECH LATELY.

103
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:56,296
CAN ANYONE NAME A MOVIE

104
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:58,549
ABOUT SELF-REPLICATING
MACHINES?

105
00:04:58,632 --> 00:04:59,716
ANYONE?

106
00:05:00,717 --> 00:05:01,343
DARCY:
SHEILA TOLD ME

107
00:05:01,426 --> 00:05:02,886
THAT IF YOU PUT KETCHUP
ON YOUR FRIES,

108
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:05,264
THE TOMATO ACID BURNS
THE CARBS RIGHT AWAY.

109
00:05:05,347 --> 00:05:06,723
CHANTAY:
SHE'S A CAFETERIA LADY.

110
00:05:06,807 --> 00:05:08,809
EVER THINK SHE'S TRYING
TO GET YOU TO BUY MORE FRIES?

111
00:05:09,601 --> 00:05:11,687
EM, WHAT'S WRONG
WITH YOUR EYES?

112
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:14,273
I'M TRYING TO KILL CHRIS
WITH MY MIND.

113
00:05:14,356 --> 00:05:15,190
OH, GOODY.

114
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:19,111
THEN YOU CAN GET SPINNER,
JAY, CRAIG,

115
00:05:19,194 --> 00:05:20,320
JT, NATE AND SEAN.

116
00:05:20,404 --> 00:05:21,321
HERE'S ME WISHING

117
00:05:21,405 --> 00:05:23,532
I LET MY DAD TALK ME
INTO AN ALL GIRLS SCHOOL.

118
00:05:25,075 --> 00:05:26,577
NO JOKE,
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

119
00:05:28,745 --> 00:05:30,914
HONEY, YOU CAN'T LET HIM
UPSET YOU LIKE THAT.

120
00:05:30,998 --> 00:05:31,957
HE'S JUST ONE DOOF.

121
00:05:32,749 --> 00:05:34,710
NO, IT'S ALL THE GUYS.

122
00:05:34,793 --> 00:05:37,296
JUDGING CONSTANTLY.

123
00:05:37,379 --> 00:05:40,048
CHESTER:
MMM, DEEP-FRIED STARCH.

124
00:05:43,552 --> 00:05:46,597
IS HE NOT THE YUMMIEST
THING YOU EVER SAW?

125
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,640
MANNY:
EM, WHAT ARE YOU DOING
THIS WEEKEND?

126
00:05:48,724 --> 00:05:49,349
EMMA:
NOTHING.

127
00:05:49,433 --> 00:05:50,684
HOW ABOUT THE GIRLS
AND I COME OVER

128
00:05:50,767 --> 00:05:53,395
AND WE'LL HAVE THE GIRLIEST SPA
WEEKEND EVER.

129
00:05:53,478 --> 00:05:54,980
ZERO TESTOSTERONE.

130
00:05:55,856 --> 00:05:56,857
HELLO?

131
00:05:57,983 --> 00:06:00,777
IS ANYONE FREE TO CONSOLE
A SISTER THIS WEEKEND?

132
00:06:00,861 --> 00:06:03,447
ABSOLUTELY.
WE'RE THERE FOR YOU.

133
00:06:13,081 --> 00:06:15,083
I AM SO, SO,
SO SORRY.

134
00:06:15,792 --> 00:06:18,170
MATT:
TEENAGERS ARE EVIL.

135
00:06:18,253 --> 00:06:21,048
I CAN'T GO BACK IN THERE
AND TEACH TWO MORE PERIODS.

136
00:06:21,131 --> 00:06:22,132
WHAT HAZEL DID?

137
00:06:22,216 --> 00:06:25,052
IT WAS JUVENILE
AND HATEFUL

138
00:06:25,135 --> 00:06:27,179
AND HUMILIATING.

139
00:06:27,262 --> 00:06:27,888
I PROMISE YOU,

140
00:06:27,971 --> 00:06:29,848
NOTHING LIKE IT
WILL EVER HAPPEN AGAIN.

141
00:06:29,932 --> 00:06:30,724
EVER.

142
00:06:30,807 --> 00:06:33,894
I DON'T WANT TO GET BOOTED OUT
OF TEACHER'S COLLEGE.

143
00:06:33,977 --> 00:06:34,811
I CAN'T.

144
00:06:34,895 --> 00:06:36,230
YOU WON'T.

145
00:06:37,231 --> 00:06:39,066
I WON'T LET YOU.

146
00:06:43,237 --> 00:06:44,821
SORRY, MADAME PAGE.

147
00:06:46,114 --> 00:06:47,115
EXCUSEZ-MOI.

148
00:06:57,918 --> 00:06:58,877
HAPPY WEEKEND, PAIGE!

149
00:07:00,838 --> 00:07:01,547
WHY THANKS, MANNY.

150
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:05,425
AND THANKS FOR TAKING
MY PRACTICE THIS MORNING.

151
00:07:05,509 --> 00:07:07,636
YOU WANT ME
TO THANK YOU?

152
00:07:07,719 --> 00:07:08,971
FOR WHAT?

153
00:07:09,054 --> 00:07:12,182
DROPPING A DIRTY BOMB
ON MY LIFE?

154
00:07:12,266 --> 00:07:13,267
PRACTICE WENT AWESOME
WITHOUT YOU.

155
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:14,309
AND IF YOU ASK
SOME OF US,

156
00:07:14,393 --> 00:07:16,270
THAT WASN'T
A COINCIDENCE.

157
00:07:16,353 --> 00:07:17,312
YOU TOLD HAZEL.

158
00:07:17,396 --> 00:07:19,523
WHEN YOU SWORE THAT
YOU WOULDN'T.

159
00:07:19,606 --> 00:07:21,775
I THOUGHT SHE KNEW,
OKAY? CHILL.

160
00:07:21,859 --> 00:07:24,528
DON'T USE YOUR OUTDATED
SLANG ON ME.

161
00:07:24,611 --> 00:07:26,446
I DOUBT THAT YOUR MOUTH
IS EVEN CONNECTED

162
00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:29,491
TO YOUR TINY, SHRIVELED,
BOY-OBSESSED BRAIN!

163
00:07:29,575 --> 00:07:30,617
I'M THE DUMB ONE?

164
00:07:30,701 --> 00:07:33,287
WHO STILL HASN'T FIGURED OUT
NOT TO CHASE OLDER GUYS.

165
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:35,873
GUYS SO OUT OF HER LEAGUE
IT'S NOT FUNNY?

166
00:07:35,956 --> 00:07:39,960
BIG WORDS FROM A GIRL
WHO PICKS UP MY LEFTOVERS.

167
00:07:40,502 --> 00:07:41,837
COULD YOU BE
MORE SELF-OBSESSED?

168
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,297
ALL YOU THINK ABOUT
IS YOUR OWN BUTT,

169
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:44,798
WHICH PROBABLY DOES REQUIRE
A LOT OF THOUGHT

170
00:07:44,882 --> 00:07:46,758

00:08:33,597 --> 00:08:34,973
I SAID NOW.

192
00:08:41,605 --> 00:08:42,773
THE WHOLE WORLD'S GOING

193
00:08:42,856 --> 00:08:44,942

194
00:08:45,609 --> 00:08:46,818
YOU'RE IN LOVE.

195
00:08:46,902 --> 00:08:49,154
WHAT WERE YOU
SUPPOSED TO DO?

196
00:08:49,238 --> 00:08:52,407
ABSTAIN FROM CONTACT
WITH MALE HUMANS.

197
00:08:52,491 --> 00:08:53,951
SEEING AS HOW I'M PAIGE,

198
00:08:54,034 --> 00:08:55,786
THE BERMUDA TRIANGLE
OF LOVE.

199
00:08:57,913 --> 00:08:59,998
HAZEL:
HI, I'M HAZEL.

200
00:09:00,082 --> 00:09:01,333
JUST WHO YOU WANT TO SEE.

201
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:05,295
WOW, SHE'S NOT JUST
AN EVIL BACK-STABBER,

202
00:09:05,379 --> 00:09:07,673
SHE'S KINDA WITTY,
TOO.

203
00:09:07,756 --> 00:09:08,882
HAZEL:
PAIGE.

204
00:09:08,966 --> 00:09:10,008
I'M SO SORRY.

205
00:09:10,843 --> 00:09:12,261
YOU WERE RIGHT.

206
00:09:12,344 --> 00:09:13,971
I AM SECRECY CHALLENGED.

207
00:09:15,681 --> 00:09:17,349
AT LEAST YOU DIDN'T CALL HIM
A PEDOPHILE.

208
00:09:21,812 --> 00:09:23,313
HATZILAKOS:
PAIGE?

209
00:09:34,992 --> 00:09:37,661
WELL, THIS WAS
A RATHER UPSETTING DAY.

210
00:09:37,744 --> 00:09:39,329
MANNY SANTOS IS A LIAR,
OKAY?

211
00:09:39,413 --> 00:09:40,664
SHE LIES.

212
00:09:42,207 --> 00:09:44,918
NOTHING EVER HAPPENED
BETWEEN YOU AND MR. OLEANDER?

213
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:47,921
THAT WOULD BE WRONG.

214
00:09:48,005 --> 00:09:49,631
HE WAS TUTORING ME
AND THAT'S ALL.

215
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:56,763
MR. SIMPSON HAS ALREADY
LEFT FOR THE DAY,

216
00:09:56,847 --> 00:09:59,266
AND FRANKLY, I'M LESS THAN
COMFORTABLE DISCUSSING THIS

217
00:09:59,349 --> 00:10:01,059
WITHOUT ONE OF YOUR
PARENTS BEING HERE.

218
00:10:01,643 --> 00:10:02,936
IS THAT TOTALLY NEEDED?

219
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:05,939
HATZILAKOS:
WE'LL ALL GONNA MEET MONDAY
AT 8:00 A.M.

220
00:10:06,523 --> 00:10:08,567
BUT I THINK
I SHOULD WARN YOU.

221
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:09,902
THERE'S A PRETTY BIG
DISCREPANCY

222
00:10:09,985 --> 00:10:11,320
IN YOUR REPORTS.

223
00:10:12,029 --> 00:10:12,696
REPORTS?

224
00:10:14,198 --> 00:10:16,241
TAKES ON THE SITUATION.

225
00:10:16,325 --> 00:10:18,452
MR. OLEANDER HAS A VERY
DIFFERENT ONE.

226
00:10:19,369 --> 00:10:22,331
HE TOLD ME THAT YOU WERE
OBSESSED WITH HIM.

227
00:10:22,414 --> 00:10:25,125
THAT YOU FOLLOWED HIM,
WOULDN'T LEAVE HIM ALONE.

228
00:10:25,209 --> 00:10:27,044
YOU STALKED HIM.

229
00:10:37,471 --> 00:10:40,140
SPIKE:
HOLD THIS RIGHT
ON THE SCRATCHES.

230
00:10:40,224 --> 00:10:42,309
MORE MOCKTAILS,
COMING RIGHT UP.

231
00:10:42,392 --> 00:10:45,687
CHANTAY:
SO PAIGE BASICALLY FIGHTS YOU
BECAUSE OF A GUY?

232
00:10:45,771 --> 00:10:46,688
MANNY:
PAIGE BASICALLY FIGHTS ME

233
00:10:46,772 --> 00:10:48,065
BECAUSE SHE'S A PSYCHO WENCH.

234
00:10:48,524 --> 00:10:49,149
SHE FOUGHT YOU

235
00:10:49,233 --> 00:10:51,944
BECAUSE GUYS ARE ALWAYS TURNING
WOMEN AGAINST EACH OTHER.

236
00:10:52,569 --> 00:10:53,904
WELL, THAT'S TRUE.

237
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,907
EMMA:
I'D RATHER BE THE WAY
WE ARE NOW.

238
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:59,493
NO GUYS, NO JUDGING,
NO UPSET.

239
00:11:00,744 --> 00:11:02,829
I LIKE THAT WE DON'T HAVE
TO WORRY ABOUT BEING PRETTY.

240
00:11:02,913 --> 00:11:03,580
JUST US.

241
00:11:04,498 --> 00:11:06,750
LET'S DECLARE
THE REVOLUTION BEGUN.

242
00:11:06,834 --> 00:11:08,418
TO HECK WITH GUYS!

243
00:11:11,004 --> 00:11:12,756
CHESTER:
'SUP, GIRLS?

244
00:11:13,257 --> 00:11:14,967
ALL:
CHESTER'S YOUR NEIGHBOUR?

245
00:11:15,050 --> 00:11:17,010
HE JUST MOVED IN.

246
00:11:17,719 --> 00:11:18,053
SO?

247
00:11:19,513 --> 00:11:20,889
CHESTER:
YOU'RE LOOKING
A LITTLE GREEN.

248
00:11:23,684 --> 00:11:24,184
WHERE ARE YOU
GOING?!

249
00:11:24,268 --> 00:11:25,519
I AM DISFIGURED!

250
00:11:28,397 --> 00:11:31,149
HAVING A SLUMBER PARTY,
EMMALINE?

251
00:11:36,071 --> 00:11:37,573
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

252
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:43,370
HI.

253
00:11:44,496 --> 00:11:44,788
PAIGE:
(ANGRILY) HI?

254
00:11:44,872 --> 00:11:47,124
YOU'RE JUST GONNA
SAY HI?

255
00:11:47,207 --> 00:11:48,375
LOOK,
I TRIED CALLING.

256
00:11:48,458 --> 00:11:50,460
YOU WEREN'T PICKING UP
YOUR PHONE.

257
00:11:50,544 --> 00:11:51,628
I'M GLAD YOU CAME OVER.

258
00:11:51,712 --> 00:11:53,630
GEE, WHY DIDN'T I PUT
A MICROPHONE IN MY BRA?

259
00:11:53,714 --> 00:11:56,800
THAT'S SUCH A NOVICE
PSYCHO STALKER MISTAKE.

260
00:11:56,884 --> 00:11:58,010
I KNOW YOU'RE UPSET.

261
00:11:58,093 --> 00:11:58,510
ME, TOO.

262
00:11:58,594 --> 00:11:59,803
NO, I'M NOT.

263
00:11:59,887 --> 00:12:01,555
I'M LIVID. BOILING.

264
00:12:01,638 --> 00:12:03,724
PISSED BEYOND
ALL RECOGNITION.

265
00:12:03,807 --> 00:12:06,560
CAN WE TALK
ABOUT THIS?

266
00:12:06,643 --> 00:12:09,062
YOU HAVE THREE MINUTES.

267
00:12:10,647 --> 00:12:14,818
PAIGE, YOU KNOW WHAT
THIS JOB MEANS TO ME.

268
00:12:14,902 --> 00:12:16,737
YOU KNOW WHAT SCHOOL
MEANS TO ME.

269
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:18,614
I'M WAITING
FOR THE US PART.

270
00:12:18,697 --> 00:12:19,406
US...

271
00:12:20,991 --> 00:12:25,162
I FIGURED WE LEAVE TIME
FOR IT TO BLOW OVER AND...

272
00:12:25,245 --> 00:12:28,081
WHEN IT'S SUMMER,
WE'RE HOME FREE.

273
00:12:28,165 --> 00:12:31,418
AND IN THE MEANTIME
I GET - WHAT - EXPELLED?

274
00:12:31,502 --> 00:12:34,588
REFERRED TO AS THAT SAD,
DESPERATE LOONY

275
00:12:34,671 --> 00:12:36,381
WHO STALKS T.A.S?

276
00:12:36,465 --> 00:12:38,050
I DIDN'T KNOW
WHAT ELSE TO SAY.

277
00:12:38,133 --> 00:12:40,260
PLEASE. YOU WANTED
TO LOOK LIKE THE GOOD GUY.

278
00:12:40,344 --> 00:12:41,845
DON'T KID YOURSELF!

279
00:12:41,929 --> 00:12:42,846
OKAY, PAIGE,

280
00:12:42,930 --> 00:12:44,681
YOU HAD A PUBLIC FIGHT
WITH MANNY SANTOS

281
00:12:44,765 --> 00:12:46,558
AFTER PROMISING ME
NOTHING ELSE WOULD BE SAID!

282
00:12:46,642 --> 00:12:48,810
SHE WAS REALLY MEAN!

283
00:12:50,729 --> 00:12:52,397
WHY AM I DOING THIS?

284
00:13:00,614 --> 00:13:03,659
MY ENTIRE FUTURE
IS ON THE LINE.

285
00:13:05,661 --> 00:13:08,038
MANNY:
EMMA'S TAKING DIBS
ON ALL THE GOOD T-SHIRTS.

286
00:13:08,121 --> 00:13:09,289
SHE MUST BE STOPPED.

287
00:13:09,998 --> 00:13:12,209
EMMA:
THEY DON'T SEEM TOO CONCERNED
WITH THEIR TIE-DYE PROSPECTS

288
00:13:12,292 --> 00:13:13,669
AT THE MOMENT.

289
00:13:13,752 --> 00:13:15,045
CHESTER HAD BETTER
COME OUT SOON.

290
00:13:15,128 --> 00:13:17,089
THESE ARE FIFTEEN
MINUTE SHOES, MAX.

291
00:13:17,172 --> 00:13:19,049
THIS IS SUPPOSED
TO BE ABOUT US.

292
00:13:19,132 --> 00:13:20,968
BOY-LESS FUN,
REMEMBER?

293
00:13:21,051 --> 00:13:21,844
A MOVEMENT?

294
00:13:26,723 --> 00:13:29,184
DARCY:
OH MY GOD,
THERE'S THREE OF HIM.

295
00:13:29,268 --> 00:13:31,228
MULTIPLE ADORABLE
CHESTERS?

296
00:13:31,311 --> 00:13:31,728
EM, I'M SORRY,

297
00:13:31,812 --> 00:13:33,021
BUT IT'S THE CALL
OF THE WILD.

298
00:13:33,105 --> 00:13:34,314
HEY CHESTER

299
00:13:34,398 --> 00:13:34,982
HIT ME!

300
00:13:39,152 --> 00:13:41,154
BOY:
OH, NICE ONE.

301
00:13:42,239 --> 00:13:43,907
WHY DID YOU DO THAT?

302
00:13:51,832 --> 00:13:52,791
(SCREAMING)

303
00:13:55,169 --> 00:13:57,921
DARCY:
CHESTER! THIS ISN'T FUNNY!

304
00:13:58,672 --> 00:14:00,841
CHESTER:
YOU GIRLS HAVE NO SENSE
OF HUMOUR.

305
00:14:00,924 --> 00:14:02,509
THAT WAS HILARIOUS.

306
00:14:04,136 --> 00:14:06,305
HE'S SO GONNA REGRET THAT.

307
00:14:09,766 --> 00:14:10,309
ALEX:
DID YOU KNOW FAKE CHEESE

308
00:14:10,392 --> 00:14:12,728
IS ONE INGREDIENT AWAY
FROM BEING PLASTIC?

309
00:14:12,811 --> 00:14:15,105
JUST LIKE
MANNY SANTOS.

310
00:14:15,189 --> 00:14:17,274
MR. O'S THE ONE
YOU SHOULD BE MAD AT.

311
00:14:17,357 --> 00:14:19,776
THAT WASN'T EXACTLY
A PRINCE CHARMING MOVE.

312
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:20,861
YEAH.

313
00:14:21,862 --> 00:14:24,781
EXCEPT WHAT IF I KIND OF
MISS HIM ALREADY?

314
00:14:24,865 --> 00:14:26,491
IS THAT BAD?

315
00:14:28,243 --> 00:14:29,077
SHOOT ME.

316
00:14:29,161 --> 00:14:31,455
DROWN ME IN FAKE CHEESE.

317
00:14:31,538 --> 00:14:32,372

IT'S NOT THAT BAD.

318
00:14:32,873 --> 00:14:34,166
AND HEY, NOW YOU KNOW
HE'S HUMAN.

319
00:14:34,249 --> 00:14:36,752
NOT SOME YOGA-BODIED
TEACHER GOD.

320
00:14:36,835 --> 00:14:37,628
MEERI:
IS THIS A COFFEE KLATSCH

321
00:14:37,711 --> 00:14:38,837
OR A WORKPLACE?

322
00:14:38,921 --> 00:14:41,423
BECAUSE IT SURE AIN'T
A SELF-SERVE.

323
00:14:41,507 --> 00:14:44,343
THOSE THINGS ARE CUSTOMERS.

324
00:14:48,055 --> 00:14:50,015
WELCOME TO MY NIGHTMARE.
COMBO?

325
00:14:50,098 --> 00:14:50,599

00:14:54,937 --> 00:14:56,146
YOU'RE MY SISTER.

330

I'M WORKING, OKAY, HULK?

HE'S, LIKE,
THE SAME AGE AS YOU.

333
00:15:01,485 --> 00:15:03,820

HE'S JUST...

335
00:15:05,572 --> 00:15:06,907
JUST DISGUSTING.

00:15:07,407 --> 00:15:08,700
JUST WONDERFUL.

337
00:15:09,576 --> 00:15:10,994

I'LL GO ALONG WITH IT.

352
00:16:26,486 --> 00:16:28,322
WITH YOUR STORY.

353
00:16:29,114 --> 00:16:31,950
I LOST MY TEMPER WITH MANNY.

354
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:36,079
MICHALCHUKS,
WE HAVE TEMPERS.

355
00:16:38,582 --> 00:16:40,250
(SIGHS) PAIGE.

356
00:16:42,002 --> 00:16:45,297
YOU CAN'T LOSE
YOUR ENTIRE LIFE.

357
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:50,219
NOT JUST FOR KISSING SOME
SELFISH HIGH SCHOOL CHICK.

358
00:16:51,470 --> 00:16:53,055
CAN'T HAPPEN.

359
00:16:53,972 --> 00:16:54,640
I UH...

360
00:16:57,142 --> 00:16:58,977
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO SAY.

361
00:16:59,061 --> 00:17:01,730
PLEASE DON'T SAY ANYTHING.

362
00:17:03,148 --> 00:17:06,151
JUST TRY AND LOOK
CUTE ON MONDAY

363
00:17:06,902 --> 00:17:10,531
SO IT ALL FEELS LIKE
IT WAS WORTH IT?

364
00:17:11,907 --> 00:17:12,908
PAIGE.

365
00:17:14,326 --> 00:17:17,246
THERE IS NO
STRINGS ATTACHED.

366
00:17:18,664 --> 00:17:20,249
DON'T WORRY.

367
00:17:21,708 --> 00:17:24,461
THERE'S NO STRINGS
WITH US.

368
00:17:41,603 --> 00:17:44,231
I DON'T NEED MY PARENTS
TO PROTECT ME.

369
00:17:44,314 --> 00:17:46,567
I'M ONLY TELLING THE TRUTH.

370
00:17:48,402 --> 00:17:51,572
I WAS INAPPROPRIATE
WITH MR. OLEANDER

371
00:17:52,406 --> 00:17:56,702
AND I'D LIKE TO TRANSFER OUT
OF HIS CLASS IMMEDIATELY.

372
00:17:56,785 --> 00:17:59,079
SIMPSON:
IT'S THE ONLY MEDIA IMMERSION
CLASS OFFERED IN GRADE 11.

373
00:17:59,162 --> 00:18:00,747
YOU WILL FAIL THE COURSE.

374
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:02,833
PAIGE:
SO I'LL REPEAT IT NEXT YEAR.

375
00:18:02,916 --> 00:18:04,168
SIMPSON:
EVERY GRADE TWELVE CREDIT
IS TAKEN, PAIGE,

376
00:18:04,251 --> 00:18:07,087
FOR UNIVERSITY
APPLICATIONS.

377
00:18:08,422 --> 00:18:11,800
WELL, THEN MAYBE I SHOULD
JUST TRANSFER SCHOOLS ENTIRELY.

378
00:18:11,884 --> 00:18:13,010
NOW.

379
00:18:13,093 --> 00:18:14,094
HATZILAKOS:
IT'S MAY.

380
00:18:14,178 --> 00:18:15,137
TRANSFERRING SO LATE,

381
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:17,347
CHANCES ARE YOU CAN'T COMPLETE
THE ACADEMIC YEAR.

382
00:18:17,431 --> 00:18:19,391
YOU WILL FAIL ENTIRELY.

383
00:18:20,017 --> 00:18:21,685
HAVE YOU REALLY THOUGHT
THIS THROUGH?

384
00:18:21,768 --> 00:18:22,853
YOU SHOULD BE GETTING
SET UP FOR UNIVERSITY,

385
00:18:22,936 --> 00:18:24,021
NOT ACTING LIKE
YOU'RE IN KINDERGARTEN.

386
00:18:24,104 --> 00:18:25,022
MR. SIMPSON.

387
00:18:25,105 --> 00:18:26,690
I'M SORRY, BUT I'M NOT BUYING
WHAT SHE'S SELLING.

388
00:18:26,773 --> 00:18:29,026
ANYTHING I SAW
DIDN'T LOOK TOO ONE-SIDED.

389
00:18:29,109 --> 00:18:30,110
YOU SAW SOMETHING?

390
00:18:31,069 --> 00:18:31,528
PAIGE:
LEAVE IT, SIR.

391
00:18:31,612 --> 00:18:32,613
PLEASE LEAVE IT.

392
00:18:32,696 --> 00:18:33,655
SIMPSON:
NO, I CAN'T.

393
00:18:33,739 --> 00:18:35,282
I TRUSTED YOU WITH MY KIDS.

394
00:18:35,365 --> 00:18:37,409
AND MY KIDS TRUSTED YOU,
INCLUDING HER.

395
00:18:37,492 --> 00:18:40,078
PLEASE STOP IT?
CAN WE JUST STOP?

396
00:18:40,162 --> 00:18:42,748
MATT'S PROFESSOR:
STUDENTS OFTEN HAVE FEELINGS
FOR THEIR TEACHERS.

397
00:18:42,831 --> 00:18:45,375
YOU JUST TOOK YOUR FEELINGS
TOO FAR.

398
00:18:45,459 --> 00:18:46,418
WE CAN HELP.

399
00:18:46,502 --> 00:18:48,837
SIMPSON:
OKAY, I'M NOT GONNA SIT HERE
AND WATCH THIS.

400
00:18:48,921 --> 00:18:50,380
PAIGE:
I DON'T CARE IF I FAIL,

401
00:18:50,464 --> 00:18:52,883
JUST CAN WE FINISH THIS NOW?
PLEASE?

402
00:18:52,966 --> 00:18:54,218
DAPHNE,
WHOSE SIDE ARE WE ON, HUH?

403
00:18:54,301 --> 00:18:55,385
THE STUDENTS
OR THE TEACHERS?

404
00:18:55,469 --> 00:18:56,887
I NEED TO KNOW
WHAT YOU SAW ARCHIE.

405
00:18:56,970 --> 00:18:57,721
HOW CAN I MAKE A DECISION

406
00:18:57,804 --> 00:18:59,264
IF I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU SAW?

407
00:19:00,224 --> 00:19:01,642
MATT'S PROFESSOR:
THERE IS A LOT AT STAKE HERE.

408
00:19:01,725 --> 00:19:02,809
WE HAD A RELATIONSHIP.

409
00:19:08,941 --> 00:19:10,150
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

410
00:19:14,655 --> 00:19:16,949
WE'VE SEEN EACH OTHER
OUTSIDE OF SCHOOL.

411
00:19:20,452 --> 00:19:21,703
IT SHOULDN'T HAVE HAPPENED.

412
00:19:25,916 --> 00:19:27,459
I TAKE FULL RESPONSIBILITY.

413
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:42,891
CHESTER:
HO HO HO.

414
00:19:42,975 --> 00:19:44,476
EMMA:
YOU CAN'T LABEL PEOPLE.

415
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:45,269
CHESTER:
WHOA.

416
00:19:45,352 --> 00:19:47,646
I THOUGHT
IT WAS CHRISTMAS.

417
00:19:48,188 --> 00:19:49,356
HOW WAS JAIL?

418
00:19:49,439 --> 00:19:51,066
I ONLY GOT A WARNING.

419
00:19:51,149 --> 00:19:52,234
SADLY,

420
00:19:52,317 --> 00:19:55,696
I GOT ANOTHER WARNING
ABOUT CHUCK AND CHAD.

421
00:19:55,779 --> 00:19:56,947
ABOUT WHO?

422
00:19:57,030 --> 00:19:57,865
MY BROTHERS.

423
00:19:57,948 --> 00:19:59,658
THEY'RE PLOTTING
THEIR REVENGE.

424
00:19:59,741 --> 00:20:03,829
SO YOUR NAMES ARE CHESTER,
CHUCK AND CHAD?

425
00:20:04,329 --> 00:20:06,915
CONSIDER ME YOUR MOLE
BEHIND ENEMY LINES,

426
00:20:06,999 --> 00:20:08,250
TWO DOORS DOWN.

427
00:20:08,333 --> 00:20:10,169
I'LL KEEP YOU POSTED.

428
00:20:10,252 --> 00:20:13,213
OKAY, THANKS.
I APPRECIATE IT.

429
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:22,806
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU DID THAT.

430
00:20:22,890 --> 00:20:23,891
THAT MAKES TWO OF US.

431
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:27,853
YOU DOING OKAY?

432
00:20:29,730 --> 00:20:32,441
WELL, I CAN STAY
IN THE B.A. PROGRAM

433
00:20:32,524 --> 00:20:35,527
BUT TEACHER'S COLLEGE
IS DONE.

434
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:40,574
WELL, MAYBE I COULD
CALL YOUR SCHOOL,

435
00:20:41,408 --> 00:20:43,243
TELL THEM IT WAS
MY FAULT OR SOMETHING?

436
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:46,997
I THINK WE'VE LEARNED
THAT REALLY DOESN'T WORK.

437
00:20:50,876 --> 00:20:52,252
I WANT YOU TO KNOW,

438
00:20:53,587 --> 00:20:55,422
YOU WOULD'VE BEEN WORTH
LOSING MY YEAR OVER.

439
00:20:56,882 --> 00:20:57,925
EXCEPT I WOULDN'T
HAVE BEEN WORTH VERY MUCH

440
00:20:58,008 --> 00:20:59,760
IF I LET YOU DO THAT.

441
00:21:01,970 --> 00:21:05,015
AND I WOULDN'T
HAVE LET YOU DO IT.

442
00:21:05,098 --> 00:21:07,392
YOU KNOW THAT,
RIGHT?

443
00:21:07,476 --> 00:21:08,477
AND NOT BECAUSE
OF GUILT,

444
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:10,187
OR ME BEING
A GENTLEMAN OR-

445
00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:11,355
MATT. I KNOW.

446
00:21:16,276 --> 00:21:18,570
I GUESS
THE GOOD NEWS IS

447
00:21:18,654 --> 00:21:20,489
IT DOESN'T MATTER
WHO SEES US IN THE PARK?

448
00:21:23,951 --> 00:21:24,868
YEAH.

449
00:21:26,662 --> 00:21:28,121
THAT IS THE GOOD NEWS.
