00:09:03,961 --> 00:09:07,548
BUT I HAD PIZZA AFTER
REHEARSAL SO I'M STUFFED.

180
00:09:07,631 --> 00:09:09,633
SPIKE:
HONEY...

181
00:09:09,716 --> 00:09:10,926
ARE YOU OKAY?

182
00:09:11,009 --> 00:09:11,677
MMM HMM.

183
00:09:12,302 --> 00:09:14,930
I'VE GOT A TON OF WORK TO DO
ON MY LINES THOUGH SO...

184
00:09:15,013 --> 00:09:15,973
GOOD NIGHT.

185
00:09:29,903 --> 00:09:31,405
(CELL PHONE RINGS)

186
00:10:12,529 --> 00:10:14,573
EMMA:
IS THIS SEAT TAKEN?

187
00:10:15,699 --> 00:10:16,992
JAY:
IT IS NOW.

188
00:10:18,702 --> 00:10:20,120
EMMA:
ARE YOU SURPRISED TO SEE ME?

189
00:10:25,834 --> 00:10:26,710
DO YOU THINK I'M WEIRD?

190
00:10:28,212 --> 00:10:29,713
NOW THERE'S A LOADED QUESTION.

191
00:10:30,964 --> 00:10:33,383
EVERYONE'S BEEN ACTING LIKE
I BELONG IN A STRAIGHTJACKET.

192
00:10:34,301 --> 00:10:36,512
WELL THAT'S THEIR PROBLEM.

193
00:10:36,595 --> 00:10:40,265
YOU'RE NO WEIRDER
THAN THE REST OF US.

194
00:10:51,443 --> 00:10:53,445
EMMA:
WHAT'S IN THE VAN?

195
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:57,658
WHAT DO YOU THINK'S
IN THE VAN?

196
00:10:57,741 --> 00:10:59,076
BEER? MORE BEER?

197
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:02,663
SMELLY SHAG CARPETING
FROM THE SEVENTIES?

198
00:11:02,746 --> 00:11:03,914
(LAUGHS)

199
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,669
YOU WANNA SEE?

200
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,941
THIS IS FULLY ANTI-CLIMACTIC.

201
00:11:31,024 --> 00:11:32,526
(DOOR SLIDES SHUT)

202
00:11:34,778 --> 00:11:36,113
COME OUT, COME OUT,
WHEREVER YOU ARE!

203
00:11:37,531 --> 00:11:38,782
JAY:
HEY...

204
00:11:44,997 --> 00:11:47,165
IT'S FOR HOOKING UP.

205
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:48,625
WHAT?

206
00:11:50,752 --> 00:11:52,421
YOU KNOW WHAT BLOW JOBS ARE,
DON'T YOU?

207
00:11:55,799 --> 00:11:56,633
HEY...

208
00:11:57,634 --> 00:12:00,304
EVERY PLAYER
GETS A PRIZE.

209
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:17,654
JT:
FORGIVE ME, LIBBY-TIBBY.

210
00:12:17,738 --> 00:12:19,281
MY ICKLE NUBBY-WUBBY
PUNKINHEAD.

211
00:12:19,364 --> 00:12:19,948
PWEASE?

212
00:12:20,616 --> 00:12:23,368
LIBERTY:
DO I HONESTLY STRIKE YOU
AS A BABY-TALK SORT OF WOMAN?

213
00:12:23,452 --> 00:12:24,828
YOU FIRED DARCY
AND NOW WE HAVE

214
00:12:24,912 --> 00:12:26,288
ZIP, ZERO, ZILCH.

215
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:33,545
LET ME BE AS
YOUR LIGHTHOUSE,

216
00:12:33,629 --> 00:12:35,672
A CANARY FOR
YOUR COALMINE.

217
00:12:35,756 --> 00:12:37,049
LET DRACULA COME
TO MY BREAST

218
00:12:37,132 --> 00:12:40,302
AND I WILL ALLOW HIM
SUSTENANCE.

219
00:12:41,803 --> 00:12:42,596
HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT?

220
00:12:43,055 --> 00:12:43,555
OH NO.

221
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,977
WE NEED RELIABLE,
ROCK SOLID.

222
00:12:49,061 --> 00:12:51,104
I DO ROCK SOLID PRETTY WELL.

223
00:12:51,188 --> 00:12:54,024
DAY BEFORE YESTERDAY
YOU MISSED YOUR CUE.

224
00:12:54,107 --> 00:12:56,985
LAST NIGHT YOU DIDN'T EVEN
SHOW UP TO MANNY'S.

225
00:12:57,069 --> 00:12:58,779
EVERYONE KNOWS YOU'RE OFF
OR WHATEVER.

226
00:12:59,363 --> 00:13:00,364
I'M NOT OFF.

227
00:13:02,074 --> 00:13:03,909
I'M YOUR MINA!

228
00:13:03,992 --> 00:13:06,411
I KNOW THE BLOCKING.

229
00:13:06,495 --> 00:13:09,164
SO CORSETS,
EVER WORN ONE?

230
00:13:17,464 --> 00:13:18,090
SO MY DAD AND CHRIS
GOT BACK

231
00:13:18,173 --> 00:13:20,217
FROM PUERTO VALLARTA
LAST NIGHT.

232
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:23,762
APPARENTLY IT'S GAY
HONEYMOONER PARADISE.

233
00:13:23,846 --> 00:13:24,888
THEY ASKED ABOUT YOU.

234
00:13:24,972 --> 00:13:26,640
"CRAZY CRAIG"?

235
00:13:27,349 --> 00:13:30,435
WHAT DID YOU TELL THEM?
OH I BET EVERYTHING.

236
00:13:30,519 --> 00:13:31,478
OKAY.

237
00:13:31,562 --> 00:13:33,188
IT'S GOOD THING I KNEW
MOOD SWINGS ARE COMMON

238
00:13:33,272 --> 00:13:34,565
WHEN YOU FIRST START MEDS.

239
00:13:34,648 --> 00:13:37,693
YOU SENT ME
TO ELLIE'S GROUP.

240
00:13:37,776 --> 00:13:40,529
WHICH SHE LOVES.
I DIDN'T THINK YOU'D MIND.

241
00:13:41,154 --> 00:13:43,115
WELL THEN YOU DIDN'T THINK
AT ALL.

242
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:49,788
JT:
ALL RIGHT, EVERYONE.

243
00:13:49,872 --> 00:13:51,957
PUT YOUR FANGS TOGETHER
FOR EMMA.

244
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:53,250
(MILD CLAP) YAY.

245
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:54,459
ALL RIGHT, LET'S JUMP
RIGHT INTO THE DEEP END

246
00:13:54,543 --> 00:13:56,712
WITH ACT TWO,
SCENE SEVEN.

247
00:14:11,810 --> 00:14:12,394
AND GO.

248
00:14:14,354 --> 00:14:16,481
NATE:
WHEN MY BRAIN SAYS COME TO YOU

249
00:14:16,565 --> 00:14:18,984
YOU SHALL CROSS LAND OR SEA
TO DO MY BIDDING

250
00:14:19,067 --> 00:14:21,153
AND TO THAT END...

251
00:14:21,236 --> 00:14:22,154
THIS.

252
00:14:23,822 --> 00:14:24,907
BUT NO...

253
00:14:26,241 --> 00:14:27,492
I CANNOT.

254
00:14:32,581 --> 00:14:33,832
(GIGGLES)

255
00:14:34,625 --> 00:14:35,709
JT:
EMMA.

256
00:14:35,792 --> 00:14:37,878
THE SCRIPT SAYS
YOU KISS HIM.

257
00:14:37,961 --> 00:14:38,837
SO KISS HIM!

258
00:14:39,838 --> 00:14:41,507
OKAY, I'M SORRY.

259
00:14:41,590 --> 00:14:44,009
IT'S JUST WEIRD DOING THIS
IN FRONT OF EVERYBODY.

260
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:46,720
JT:
IT'S NOT REAL.

261
00:14:46,803 --> 00:14:49,348
THERE'S NO FOURTH WALL.

262
00:14:49,431 --> 00:14:52,142
NEXT PLAY, LIBERTY?
UNIONIZED ACTORS.

263
00:14:53,185 --> 00:14:54,645
SORRY, I'LL GET IT
BY TOMORROW, OKAY?

264
00:14:54,728 --> 00:14:55,229
I PROMISE.

265
00:14:56,230 --> 00:14:58,357
FINE, TOMORROW.
DON'T LET ME DOWN.

266
00:15:01,068 --> 00:15:02,361
OKAY, SET CHANGE
FOR SCENE ONE.

267
00:15:02,444 --> 00:15:02,861
GO.

268
00:15:19,044 --> 00:15:21,046
ALEX:
GIVE YOU ONE MINUTE WITH NATE
YOU'D DO BETTER THAN THAT.

269
00:15:21,129 --> 00:15:22,256
AMY:
I'D EAT HIM ALL UP.

270
00:15:22,339 --> 00:15:26,343
YOU'D JUST SEE HIS BIG MANLY
SHOES STICKING OUT.

271
00:15:27,803 --> 00:15:29,304
FOR THE SAKE OF GUYS
EVERYWHERE

272
00:15:29,388 --> 00:15:31,098
I HOPE SHE BECOMES A NUN.

273
00:15:31,181 --> 00:15:33,725
ONE OF THEM BIG ONES
THAT SING ALL THE TIME.

274
00:15:33,809 --> 00:15:34,726
ALEX:
OH AMY, THAT'S MEAN.

275
00:15:34,810 --> 00:15:37,563
THE POOR GIRL SUFFERS FROM
PENIS-A-PHOBIA.

276
00:15:37,646 --> 00:15:39,565
HER MOM CAN'T EVEN BUY BANANAS.

277
00:15:39,648 --> 00:15:41,608
AMY:
ONE TIME THEY GAVE HER
A HOT DOG?

278
00:15:41,692 --> 00:15:42,985
SHE THREW UP FOR A WEEK.

279
00:15:43,068 --> 00:15:44,069
(LAUGHS)

280
00:15:44,152 --> 00:15:45,863
ALEX:
SIMPSON HAS TO KEEP
HIS JOCKEY SHORTS

281
00:15:45,946 --> 00:15:48,532
LOCKED IN A SHED OUT BACK
OR SHE WON'T GO INTO THE HOUSE.

282
00:15:53,495 --> 00:15:55,330
AMY:
IS THAT MINE?

283
00:15:55,414 --> 00:15:57,082
NO. IT'S MINE.

284
00:15:58,125 --> 00:15:58,917
WHAT WAS THAT ABOUT?

285
00:16:08,844 --> 00:16:10,095
EMMA:
JAY! HEY.

286
00:16:10,679 --> 00:16:11,930
DID YOU KNOW I'VE ONLY BEEN
IN A CAR

287
00:16:12,014 --> 00:16:13,932
WITH 16 SPEAKERS TWICE?

288
00:16:14,474 --> 00:16:15,184
POOR YOU.

289
00:16:16,018 --> 00:16:17,311
AMY WAS BEING REALLY
MEAN ABOUT REHEARSAL

290
00:16:17,394 --> 00:16:17,895
AND WHAT HAPPENED,

291
00:16:17,978 --> 00:16:19,104
SO I SHOWED HER
THE BRACELET

292
00:16:19,188 --> 00:16:21,190
AND SHE SHUT RIGHT UP.
IT'S AMY KRYPTONITE.

293
00:16:23,192 --> 00:16:26,195
THIS ISN'T SOME
BROWNIE BADGE COMPETITION.

294
00:16:26,278 --> 00:16:28,280
MAYBE YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO NEEDS TO SHUT UP.

295
00:16:28,363 --> 00:16:30,324
YOU DIDN'T EARN ANYTHING.
AMY DID.

296
00:16:32,534 --> 00:16:33,744
SHE EARNED THEM
FROM YOU?

297
00:16:35,037 --> 00:16:37,122
THERE ARE A LOT OF GIRLS
DOWN THAT RAVINE, EMMA.

298
00:16:38,832 --> 00:16:39,958
I PICKED YOU.

299
00:16:54,389 --> 00:16:56,058
(KNOCKING ON A DOOR)

300
00:16:59,102 --> 00:17:02,397
YOU KNOW HOW TO RE-STRING
A GUITAR?

301
00:17:02,481 --> 00:17:05,776
GET ASH TO.
SHE'S GOOD AT FORCING THINGS.

302
00:17:05,859 --> 00:17:07,236
LIKE FORCING ME TO COME HERE

303
00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:10,239
WITH THIS PAPER-THIN
GUITAR EXCUSE?

304
00:17:15,911 --> 00:17:16,912
CRAIG...

305
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:20,165
I USED TO CUT MYSELF.

306
00:17:20,249 --> 00:17:20,874
I KNOW.

307
00:17:21,583 --> 00:17:25,504
ELLIE:
WHAT'S BIZARRE IS THAT
I'M ALWAYS GONNA BE A CUTTER.

308
00:17:25,587 --> 00:17:28,006
EVEN IF I DON'T DO IT FOR YEARS,
IT'S STILL ME.

309
00:17:28,757 --> 00:17:30,175
WELL, THAT SUCKS.

310
00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:33,178
IT JUST- IT JUST IS.

311
00:17:35,013 --> 00:17:38,350
IT DOESN'T MATTER HOW I FEEL
OR HOW ANYONE ELSE FEELS.

312
00:17:42,271 --> 00:17:43,313
I'M BI-POLAR.

313
00:17:44,898 --> 00:17:47,109
AND APPARENTLY
IT DOESN'T MATTER

314
00:17:47,192 --> 00:17:49,611
IF I THINK THAT SUCKS EITHER.

315
00:17:52,906 --> 00:17:54,867
THEY THINK KURT COBAIN
WAS BI-POLAR.

316
00:17:55,951 --> 00:17:56,326
YEAH?

317
00:17:57,452 --> 00:17:58,412
ELLIE:
IF HE'D JUST ACCEPTED IT

318
00:17:58,495 --> 00:18:00,747
MAYBE IT ALL
WOULD'VE BEEN DIFFERENT.

319
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:02,416
NIGEL FROM GROUP
MANAGES OKAY.

320
00:18:04,126 --> 00:18:04,793
HE SEEMED COOL.

321
00:18:04,877 --> 00:18:06,545
ELLIE:
HE IS.

322
00:18:06,628 --> 00:18:08,547
YOU SHOULD COME BACK.

323
00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:11,008
AND YOU SHOULD PROBABLY
CALL ASH.

324
00:18:13,010 --> 00:18:13,343
WHY?

325
00:18:14,553 --> 00:18:17,222
WHY? 'CAUSE I BIT HER HEAD OFF
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SCHOOL?

326
00:18:17,306 --> 00:18:20,058
YEAH, MAYBE 'CAUSE
OF THAT.

327
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:25,898
ALL SHE TALKS ABOUT LATELY
IS MEDICATION,

328
00:18:25,981 --> 00:18:27,274
MY SHRINK AND MY MOODS.

329
00:18:27,357 --> 00:18:29,651
SHE CARES ABOUT YOU.
A LOT.

330
00:18:31,486 --> 00:18:32,529
I KNOW.

331
00:18:47,503 --> 00:18:50,088
YOU ALREADY HAD
THE TOUR.

332
00:18:50,172 --> 00:18:51,840
SHOW ME AGAIN.

333
00:18:55,344 --> 00:18:56,678
SHOW ME AGAIN FOR REAL.

334
00:18:59,556 --> 00:19:00,891
AFTER YOU.

335
00:19:19,535 --> 00:19:21,870
ASHLEY:
I SHOULD'VE TOLD YOU SOONER
THAT IT WAS ELLIE'S GROUP.

336
00:19:23,497 --> 00:19:25,249
BUT I STILL LIKED IT.

337
00:19:26,792 --> 00:19:28,252
I'M GONNA GO AGAIN
NEXT WEEK.

338
00:19:29,837 --> 00:19:31,672
ASHLEY:
YOU ARE?

339
00:19:34,967 --> 00:19:35,801
ASH...

340
00:19:37,094 --> 00:19:39,847
I WANT BE YOUR BOYFRIEND.

341
00:19:39,930 --> 00:19:41,223
OF COURSE.

342
00:19:41,306 --> 00:19:42,891
WE WENT THROUGH THIS
A COUPLE MONTHS AGO, REMEMBER?

343
00:19:42,975 --> 00:19:44,226
I WANT BE THAT BOYFRIEND

344
00:19:44,309 --> 00:19:48,730
NOT THE CRAZY GUY
YOU GOT TO SAVE ALL THE TIME.

345
00:19:50,816 --> 00:19:52,860
I WANT TO TALK ABOUT MUSIC
AND MOVIES

346
00:19:52,943 --> 00:19:54,945
AND, YES, GOULASH.

347
00:19:56,446 --> 00:19:58,031
OKAY. GOT IT.

348
00:19:59,074 --> 00:19:59,992
GOOD.

349
00:20:02,452 --> 00:20:03,161
SO...

350
00:20:19,553 --> 00:20:20,554
WELL?!

351
00:20:23,015 --> 00:20:24,016
EMMA:
I WENT FOR A WALK.

352
00:20:24,975 --> 00:20:26,143
SIMPSON:
IT'S 2:00 IN THE MORNING.

353
00:20:26,518 --> 00:20:27,936
SPIKE:
WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU?

354
00:20:33,483 --> 00:20:35,986
(CHOKING UP)
I CAN'T SLEEP.

355
00:20:36,069 --> 00:20:37,362
I HAVEN'T BEEN...

356
00:20:40,616 --> 00:20:41,867
EVER SINCE THE SHOOTING.

357
00:20:43,827 --> 00:20:46,872
I DIDN'T WANT
TO UPSET YOU GUYS BUT...

358
00:20:46,955 --> 00:20:49,499
SINCE THEN
I WAS SO SCARED.

359
00:20:49,583 --> 00:20:50,918
OH, HONEY.

360
00:20:54,463 --> 00:20:56,256
DO YOU WANT TO GO
TO BED, EM?

361
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:57,549
THERE'S ALWAYS TOMORROW
TO TALK.

362
00:20:58,967 --> 00:21:00,385
OKAY. YEAH.

363
00:21:01,136 --> 00:21:02,387
YOU'LL BE ABLE
TO SLEEP?

364
00:21:03,931 --> 00:21:05,891
DON'T WORRY, MOM.

365
00:21:11,897 --> 00:21:13,565
NIGHTY-NIGHT.
