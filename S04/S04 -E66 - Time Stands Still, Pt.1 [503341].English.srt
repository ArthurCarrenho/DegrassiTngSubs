356
00:15:14,957 --> 00:15:16,959
AND ANYWAYS,
GOLF IS NOT A SPORT.

357
00:15:22,047 --> 00:15:25,092
SPINNER:
HEY MAN, THAT WAS SO SWEET.

358
00:15:25,175 --> 00:15:26,677
I MEAN, YOU'RE A KNOW-IT-ALL
TRIVIA MACHINE.

00:15:33,183 --> 00:15:33,809
AFFIRMATIVE.

363
00:15:34,518 --> 00:15:35,936
IT'S PROBABLY BETTER
HIM THAN ME, RIGHT?

364
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:44,611
WE'RE COOL,
MAN.

365
00:15:51,952 --> 00:15:52,786
BETTER HIM THAN ME?

366
00:15:53,912 --> 00:15:54,788
SPINNER:
YEAH.

367
00:15:54,872 --> 00:15:58,500
ALL RIGHT, YOU ARE SURE
ALEX CAN SET THIS UP?

368
00:15:58,584 --> 00:16:02,171
JAY:
DUDE, THE BEST PART ABOUT
DATING THE STUDENT COUNCIL VP?

369
00:16:02,254 --> 00:16:04,590
NOBODY ASKS QUESTIONS.

370
00:16:08,343 --> 00:16:09,636
SYDNEY:
I'M SORRY I'M LATE.

371
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:10,804
NO PROBLEM.

372
00:16:10,888 --> 00:16:11,889
YOU'RE HERE.

373
00:16:12,890 --> 00:16:14,099
I... I REALLY
APPRECIATE THAT.

374
00:16:16,852 --> 00:16:19,771
SAY SOMETHING ELSE
TO MAKE ME STAY.

375
00:16:21,732 --> 00:16:23,817
I NEED HELP.
BADLY.

376
00:16:25,319 --> 00:16:26,528
CRAIG WAS RIGHT,
YOU WERE RIGHT.

377
00:16:26,612 --> 00:16:28,113
I SHOULD'VE COME TO YOU
WEEKS AGO.

378
00:16:30,699 --> 00:16:31,491
I COULD SIT HERE ALL DAY

379
00:16:31,575 --> 00:16:32,993
AND COME UP WITH WAYS
TO HATE YOU.

380
00:16:33,076 --> 00:16:35,454
BUT YOUR FAMILY'S
IN TROUBLE.

381
00:16:36,496 --> 00:16:38,457
BEING HERE ISN'T EASY FOR ME,
EITHER, JOEY.

382
00:16:39,499 --> 00:16:40,584
I KNOW.

383
00:16:46,173 --> 00:16:46,590
LOOK,

384
00:16:47,674 --> 00:16:49,343
THE WAY WE FINISHED...

385
00:16:49,927 --> 00:16:50,928
I'M NOT PROUD OF THAT.

386
00:16:54,598 --> 00:16:56,016
MY ASSISTANT WILL BE HERE
WITHIN THE HOUR

387
00:16:56,099 --> 00:16:58,560
AND PUT A SIGN UP
ON YOUR LAWN.

388
00:16:58,644 --> 00:16:59,853
I'LL POP BY AFTER WORK,

389
00:16:59,937 --> 00:17:01,271
SAY 5:30 P.M.?

390
00:17:02,439 --> 00:17:04,900
SO, WE'RE GOING
WITH THE OPEN HOUSE?

391
00:17:04,983 --> 00:17:06,902
THINK ABOUT CREATING
AN ATMOSPHERE.

392
00:17:06,985 --> 00:17:09,363
START WITH SOME
MUSIC PLAYING.

393
00:17:09,446 --> 00:17:10,405
JOEY:
MUSIC?

394
00:17:10,489 --> 00:17:12,366
BUT NOT THAT DEMO TAPE

395
00:17:12,449 --> 00:17:13,700

FROM YOUR BAND.

396
00:17:13,784 --> 00:17:14,201
YOUR BAND-

397
00:17:14,993 --> 00:17:15,744
ZIT REMEDY.

398
00:17:15,827 --> 00:17:17,829
SYDNEY:
NO "ZITS".
NO "REMEDIES".

399
00:17:17,913 --> 00:17:20,040
BUT A PIE - SOMETHING
BAKING IN THE OVEN?

400
00:17:20,123 --> 00:17:21,750
THAT WOULD BE NICE.

401
00:17:22,793 --> 00:17:23,210
