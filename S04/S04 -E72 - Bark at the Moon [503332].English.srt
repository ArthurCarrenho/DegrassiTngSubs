RIGHT AFTER I GET THIS.

4
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:21,480
THE NEW MANAGER
IS A BATTLE AXE.

5
00:00:21,563 --> 00:00:24,191
I NEED TO BOOST
TURNOVER OR ELSE...

6
00:00:24,274 --> 00:00:26,443
SWEAT ON YOU,
KIND OF CUTE.

7
00:00:26,527 --> 00:00:28,570
YOU SWEATING
ON FOOD SERVICE ITEMS?

8
00:00:28,654 --> 00:00:29,821
A LITTLE LESS CUTE.

9
00:00:30,197 --> 00:00:31,615
ALL BETTER.

10
00:00:34,326 --> 00:00:35,536
OH MY GOD,

11
00:00:35,619 --> 00:00:38,205
THIS IS MY FAVOURITE
SONG EVER.

12
00:00:38,288 --> 00:00:40,332
OH MY GOD,
MY EARS ARE BLEEDING.

13
00:00:40,999 --> 00:00:42,960
WHY AM I YOUR FRIEND?

14
00:00:43,043 --> 00:00:43,627
FRIEND?

15
00:00:44,294 --> 00:00:44,545

YOU MAKE ME BATHE DAILY,

18
00:00:48,924 --> 00:00:50,843
ME MAKE YOU GO CAMPING.

19
00:00:53,262 --> 00:00:55,222
NOW I KNOW WE'RE NOT
"OFFICIAL"

20
00:00:55,305 --> 00:00:56,682
BUT WE SHOULD BE.

21
00:00:57,474 --> 00:00:59,059
SO WHAT DO YOU SAY?

22
00:01:00,143 --> 00:01:01,228

MANNY:
FOR SCIENCE YOU'RE GONNA
HAVE MS. HATZILAKOS.

35
00:01:51,028 --> 00:01:52,446
AND FOR MATH,
MR. ARMSTRONG.

36
00:01:52,529 --> 00:01:54,781
MATH IS CHAFE.
I HATE IT.

37
00:01:54,865 --> 00:01:55,616
SO IS THE ROYAL TOUR

38
00:01:55,699 --> 00:01:56,950
STANDARD DEGRASSI
PROCEDURE?

39
00:01:57,034 --> 00:01:58,702
OR IS IT JUST 'CAUSE
OF THE SHOOTING?

40
00:01:58,785 --> 00:02:00,537
THE SHOOTING IS NOT WHAT
OUR SCHOOL'S ABOUT.

41
00:02:00,621 --> 00:02:02,414
SO I GUESS THE WELCOMING
COMMITTEE

42
00:02:02,497 --> 00:02:03,749
IS JUST ME TRYING
TO SHOW PEOPLE

43
00:02:03,832 --> 00:02:05,334
THAT THERE'S OTHER
STUFF.

44
00:02:05,417 --> 00:02:06,793
THE CAFETERIA'S NEXT.

45
00:02:06,877 --> 00:02:08,462
TASTY BURRITOS.

46
00:02:08,545 --> 00:02:09,713
SIMPSON:
PLEASE EXCUSE THE INTERRUPTION.

47
00:02:09,796 --> 00:02:11,548
WOULD PAIGE MICHALCHUK
AND MARCO DEL ROSSI

48
00:02:11,632 --> 00:02:12,966
PLEASE REPORT
TO THE PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE?

49
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:15,969
THIS IS CRAIG MANNING,
FROM GRADE ELEVEN.

50
00:02:16,053 --> 00:02:17,221
THIS IS CHESTER'S FIRST DAY.

51
00:02:17,304 --> 00:02:19,056
OH. COOL.
WELCOME.

52
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:20,057
CAN I TALK TO YOU
FOR A SECOND?

53
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:21,391
UM ACTUALLY,
I'M JUST-

54
00:02:21,475 --> 00:02:22,976
THIS WAY
TO LOS BURRITOS?

55
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:24,561
YEAH.

56
00:02:25,062 --> 00:02:28,440
CRAIG:
SO A LOT HAS BEEN GOING ON
IN MY HEAD LATELY.

57
00:02:28,524 --> 00:02:30,442
INCLUDING THINKING
ABOUT LAST YEAR.

58
00:02:30,526 --> 00:02:32,444
CRAIG, IT'S OKAY.

59
00:02:32,945 --> 00:02:34,947
NO, IT'S NOT OKAY.

60
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:38,200
I'VE MADE A LOT OF MISTAKES
SINCE COMING HERE,

61
00:02:38,283 --> 00:02:40,244
BUT YOU WERE PROBABLY
THE BIGGEST.

62
00:02:42,788 --> 00:02:43,872
I MEAN...

63
00:02:45,707 --> 00:02:48,502
IF I COULD GO
BACK IN TIME,

64
00:02:48,585 --> 00:02:51,630
I WOULD HAVE STOPPED
THAT NIGHT,

65
00:02:51,713 --> 00:02:54,716
SAVED US BOTH
A LOT OF PAIN.

66
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,135
THAT'S ALL YOU
THINK IT WAS?

67
00:02:57,427 --> 00:02:59,429
A LOT OF PAIN?

68
00:03:00,973 --> 00:03:03,308
GEE, THANKS FOR YOUR
APOLOGY,

69
00:03:04,101 --> 00:03:05,143
BUT I'M FINE.

70
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:14,027
PAIGE:
MADEMOISELLE SPIRIT SQUAD,
MR. PREZ.

71
00:03:14,111 --> 00:03:15,195
THAT'S WHY WE WERE
CALLED DOWN.

72
00:03:15,279 --> 00:03:16,363
MARCO:
YEAH, BUT WHAT IF IT'S NOT?

73
00:03:16,446 --> 00:03:17,614
WHAT IF WE'VE DONE
SOMETHING BAD?

74
00:03:17,698 --> 00:03:18,699
WILL IT GO ON MY RECORD?

75
00:03:18,782 --> 00:03:20,367
PAIGE, WILL IT COST ME GETTING
INTO THE MY SCHOOL OF CHOICE?

76
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:21,535
IT'S GONNA COST YOU
A HANDSHAPED WELT

77
00:03:21,618 --> 00:03:22,828
IF YOU DON'T CALM DOWN.

78
00:03:25,789 --> 00:03:27,624
MANNY, HON,
WHAT'RE YOU UP TO?

79
00:03:27,708 --> 00:03:29,459
I'M JUST GOING TO MATH
UNFORTUNATELY.

80
00:03:29,543 --> 00:03:30,752
WELL,
BECAUSE I AM SO NICE?

81
00:03:30,836 --> 00:03:32,671
YOU CAN TAKE MY RADITCH
MEETING INSTEAD, OKAY?

82
00:03:32,754 --> 00:03:33,881
MANNY:
RADITCH?

83
00:03:33,964 --> 00:03:36,466
BUT I'M ACTUALLY REALLY-

84
00:03:37,718 --> 00:03:40,721
SOMETIMES
I SO HATE THAT GIRL.

85
00:03:42,306 --> 00:03:44,975
UH... LEFT SIDE,
SMIDGE LOW.

86
00:03:45,684 --> 00:03:46,768
DON'T THEY TEACH
"DISPLAYS"

87
00:03:46,852 --> 00:03:48,562
IN TEACHER SCHOOL?

88
00:03:48,645 --> 00:03:50,814
YEAH.
IT'S MY MINOR.

89
00:03:52,316 --> 00:03:54,151
SOCIAL FAUX PAS?

90
00:03:54,735 --> 00:03:56,820
IT'S NOT REALLY ME.

91
00:03:57,362 --> 00:04:01,575
WHICH IS WHY SHOWING UP
AT THE BAR THAT NIGHT?

92
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:04,870
IT MAKES ME
A COMPLETE DORK.

93
00:04:04,953 --> 00:04:06,705
YEAH WELL,
YOU KNOW,

94
00:04:06,788 --> 00:04:09,082
A DORK
WITH A LOT OF GUTS.

95
00:04:09,166 --> 00:04:11,877
AND SOME PRETTY GOOD
FAKE I.D.

96
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:14,963
YEAH, I KNOW
THE RIGHT PEOPLE.

97
00:04:16,006 --> 00:04:17,424
SO, CHARLIE...

98
00:04:18,383 --> 00:04:19,760
SHE'S PRETTY.

99
00:04:19,843 --> 00:04:22,221
GREAT SENSE
OF HUMOUR.

100
00:04:22,304 --> 00:04:23,764
TOTAL PACKAGE.

101
00:04:23,847 --> 00:04:24,598
YEAH...

102
00:04:24,681 --> 00:04:27,768
AND NOW SHE'S TOTALLY
IN MY PAST.

103
00:04:27,851 --> 00:04:28,894
WE BROKE UP.

104
00:04:28,977 --> 00:04:30,771
NOT BECAUSE OF US.

105
00:04:30,854 --> 00:04:32,773
NOT THAT THERE
IS AN US,

106
00:04:32,856 --> 00:04:34,858
BUT CHARLIE AND I,

107
00:04:35,484 --> 00:04:38,320
WE JUST WEREN'T
WORKING OUT.

108
00:04:39,821 --> 00:04:42,866
YOU'RE, WHAT,
MY BROTHER'S AGE?

109
00:04:43,534 --> 00:04:45,702
A YEAR OLDER THAN THAT?

110
00:04:45,786 --> 00:04:47,788
HE'S DATING MARCO.

111
00:04:48,539 --> 00:04:51,458
YEAH, BUT HE'S NOT
MARCO'S TEACHER.

112
00:04:51,542 --> 00:04:54,086
WELL,
YOU'RE NOT MINE.

113
00:04:54,169 --> 00:04:55,337
NOT REALLY.

114
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:56,964
SIMPSON:
PAIGE.

115
00:04:57,047 --> 00:04:57,840
CLASS ISN'T QUITE THE SAME

116
00:04:57,923 --> 00:05:00,884
WITHOUT YOU TALKING
TO HAZEL SO...

117
00:05:05,055 --> 00:05:06,890
(BELL RINGS)

118
00:05:10,018 --> 00:05:11,645
RADITCH:
IF YOU'RE WAITING
FOR THE PRINCIPAL,

119
00:05:11,728 --> 00:05:13,438
AND I ASSUME YOU ARE,

120
00:05:14,106 --> 00:05:15,649
I'M NOT THE PRINCIPAL
YOU'RE WAITING FOR.

121
00:05:15,732 --> 00:05:17,150
SHE'S INSIDE.

122
00:05:17,693 --> 00:05:19,152
IS THAT, LIKE,
A RIDDLE, SIR?

123
00:05:19,236 --> 00:05:19,778
NO.

124
00:05:19,862 --> 00:05:22,114
IT'S LIKE, THE BOARD HAS
ASSIGNED ME TO ANOTHER SCHOOL.

125
00:05:31,248 --> 00:05:32,916
SURPRISE, SURPRISE.

126
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:33,876
WHOA.

127
00:05:33,959 --> 00:05:35,169
YOU'RE OUR NEW PRINCIPAL?

128
00:05:35,252 --> 00:05:36,211
YES, I AM.

129
00:05:36,295 --> 00:05:37,838
FOR THE TIME BEING.

130
00:05:37,921 --> 00:05:38,881
SO WHERE'S PAIGE?

131
00:05:39,923 --> 00:05:41,008
I'M PAIGE.

132
00:05:41,091 --> 00:05:41,758
FOR THE TIME BEING.

133
00:05:42,593 --> 00:05:43,427
ALL RIGHT.

134
00:05:44,928 --> 00:05:47,598
SO THE BOARD HAS DONE
THEIR PART

135
00:05:48,599 --> 00:05:50,767
IN HELPING EVERYONE DEAL
WITH THE SHOOTING.

136
00:05:50,851 --> 00:05:52,686
AND NOW IT'S OUR TURN.

137
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,856
WE NEED TO BRING
SCHOOL SPIRIT BACK.

138
00:05:55,939 --> 00:05:57,649
WELL, WHAT ABOUT
THE SCHOOL PLAY?

139
00:05:59,193 --> 00:06:00,861
AH, THAT'S MY
NEXT MEETING

140
00:06:00,944 --> 00:06:02,529
WITH JT AND LIBERTY.

141
00:06:02,613 --> 00:06:03,906
I'M GONNA GREEN-LIGHT
THEIR PROJECT.

142
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:07,492
THIS IS GREAT
FOR SO MANY REASONS.

143
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:09,536
MARCO THOUGHT WE WERE
IN TROUBLE.

144
00:06:10,078 --> 00:06:10,537
SHUT UP, MANNY.

145
00:06:11,622 --> 00:06:11,872
NO.

146
00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:13,457
YOU'RE NOT IN TROUBLE,
AT ALL.

147
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:14,208
IN FACT...

148
00:06:15,459 --> 00:06:17,211
WE NEED SOME
MORE GREAT IDEAS.

149
00:06:17,294 --> 00:06:18,712
AND WHEN I SAY WE,

150
00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:20,088
I MEAN YOU TWO.

151
00:06:28,138 --> 00:06:29,848
SO SHE WANTS US
TO ORGANIZE

152
00:06:29,932 --> 00:06:31,808
THIS HUGE EVENT
TO RAISE SCHOOL SPIRIT.

153
00:06:31,892 --> 00:06:33,185
ISN'T THAT AMAZING?

154
00:06:33,268 --> 00:06:35,229
YEAH. THAT'S COOL.

155
00:06:35,312 --> 00:06:36,146
I NEED IDEAS.

156
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:37,481
EMMA, PLEASE HELP ME?

157
00:06:37,564 --> 00:06:39,066
NOW, PLEASE?

158
00:06:39,733 --> 00:06:43,153
I'M SURE YOU'LL
THINK OF SOMETHING.

159
00:06:46,865 --> 00:06:48,534
BAAA, BAAAA...

160
00:06:49,785 --> 00:06:50,285
WELL, HI.

161
00:06:50,369 --> 00:06:51,328
I'M LA-LA-LLAMA,

SO, ABOUT WHAT
I ASKED YOU YESTERDAY...

00:07:01,964 --> 00:07:04,633
WE'RE HAVING FUN,
RIGHT?

167
00:07:04,716 --> 00:07:08,762
SO WHY DO WE HAVE TO GO
AND MAKE IT ALL OFFICIAL?

168
00:07:08,846 --> 00:07:11,849
'CAUSE THAT'S WHAT
COUPLES DO.

169
00:07:13,851 --> 00:07:16,103
OOH YIKES,

00:07:31,034 --> 00:07:32,035
MANNY:
YOU JUST WANT TO DANCE.

00:07:32,119 --> 00:07:32,744
ADMIT IT.

00:07:33,871 --> 00:07:36,081
EVERYBODY LIKES

180
00:07:36,164 --> 00:07:37,040
THE YOUNG, THE OLD...

181
00:07:38,417 --> 00:07:41,003
MY EX-SCHOOL HAD THIS GREAT
DANCE THIS ONE TIME.

182
00:07:41,086 --> 00:07:42,337
IT WAS A CUPID THEME.

183
00:07:42,421 --> 00:07:43,255
EVERYBODY PAIRED OFF
BY COMPUTER.

184
00:07:44,715 --> 00:07:45,883
ELECTRONIC ICE-BREAKING.
NICE.

185
00:07:46,592 --> 00:07:48,552
THE IDEA'S YOURS
IF YOU WANT IT.

186
00:07:48,635 --> 00:07:51,680
OF COURSE, IT'LL COST YOU
A FREE TICKET

187
00:07:51,763 --> 00:07:52,764
AND A DANCE.

188
00:07:57,603 --> 00:07:59,980
AND YOU KNOW, I THINK
HE WAS TALKING TO YOU.

189
00:08:02,774 --> 00:08:04,234
(BELL RINGS)

190
00:08:08,363 --> 00:08:10,866
AND THIS FRIDAY
WE'RE HAVING A MAJOR DANCE.

191
00:08:10,949 --> 00:08:13,368
HOLD ON TO YOUR HEARTS
AS CUPID HAS HIS WAY.

192
00:08:13,452 --> 00:08:15,162
COMPUTERS WILL BE SET UP
AROUND THE SCHOOL.

193
00:08:15,245 --> 00:08:16,538
ANSWER A FEW QUESTIONS

194
00:08:16,622 --> 00:08:17,831
AND WHEN YOU ARRIVE
AT THE DANCE,

195
00:08:17,915 --> 00:08:19,833
YOUR LOVE MATCH
WILL BE WAITING.

196
00:08:22,002 --> 00:08:24,129
MR. OLEANDER
IS A TEACHER, PAIGE.

197
00:08:24,213 --> 00:08:26,089
THANKS MARCO,
I DIDN'T REALIZE THAT.

198
00:08:26,173 --> 00:08:27,090
WELL, YOU KEEP
TALKING ABOUT HIM

199
00:08:27,174 --> 00:08:29,009
LIKE HE'S SOME HOT
12TH GRADER OR SOMETHING.

200
00:08:29,092 --> 00:08:30,594
NO, HE'S A BIG BABY

201
00:08:30,677 --> 00:08:32,179
WHO WON'T TAKE
THE NEXT STEP.

202
00:08:32,262 --> 00:08:33,931
HE WON'T EVEN CRAWL
TOWARDS IT.

203
00:08:34,014 --> 00:08:35,390
OW, LEG CRAMP.

204
00:08:35,474 --> 00:08:36,350
OW, UNWISE DECISION.

205
00:08:37,601 --> 00:08:38,936
IT'S NOT A DECISION.

206
00:08:39,019 --> 00:08:41,355
I CAN'T TURN OFF HOW I FEEL.

207
00:08:42,356 --> 00:08:44,024
FINE,
IT'S NOT CONVENTIONAL,

208
00:08:44,107 --> 00:08:46,485
BUT I THOUGHT YOU
OF ALL PEOPLE WOULD UNDERSTAND.

209
00:08:49,071 --> 00:08:49,696
WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO?

210
00:08:50,614 --> 00:08:52,074
BE ON MY SIDE,
FOR STARTERS.

211
00:08:53,784 --> 00:08:55,077
KWAN:
NAMASTE,

212
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:56,662
YOGIS AND YOGINIS.

213
00:08:58,330 --> 00:08:59,289
UM, MS KWAN?

214
00:08:59,373 --> 00:09:02,084
THIS IS MR. OLEANDER'S
ASHTANGA CLASS.

215
00:09:02,167 --> 00:09:03,335
KWAN:
NOT ANY MORE.

216
00:09:03,418 --> 00:09:04,586
WITH HIS WORKLOAD,

217
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:07,506
YOGA WAS TOO MUCH
OF A COMMITMENT.

218
00:09:14,346 --> 00:09:16,056
SO, YOU AND MARCO
HAVE PASSWORDS.

219
00:09:16,139 --> 00:09:17,933
YOU CAN ACCESS THE PROGRAM
BEFORE THE DANCE

220
00:09:18,016 --> 00:09:19,101
AND GENERATE YOUR RESULTS.

221
00:09:20,143 --> 00:09:21,270
WOW.
YOU MAKE IT SOUND COOL.

222
00:09:22,563 --> 00:09:25,899
WELL, BASICALLY
YOU PLUG IN A NAME...

223
00:09:25,983 --> 00:09:28,527
THEN YOU ANSWER FIELDS LIKE
FAVORITE SUPERHERO?

224
00:09:29,486 --> 00:09:31,738
DOES BUBBLES FROM
THE POWER PUFF GIRLS COUNT?

225
00:09:32,865 --> 00:09:35,075
NO.
HOW ABOUT FAVOURITE MOVIE?

226
00:09:35,659 --> 00:09:36,410
OOOH.
DEFINITELY "HONEY!"

227
00:09:38,996 --> 00:09:39,663
BOYFRIEND'S NAME?

228
00:09:42,082 --> 00:09:43,417
I DON'T HAVE ONE.

229
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,627
NOTHING SERIOUS ANYWAY.

230
00:09:45,711 --> 00:09:48,797
SO WHY DON'T YOU
PUT IN YOUR NAME?

231
00:09:48,881 --> 00:09:50,507
JUST FOR FUN.

232
00:09:51,341 --> 00:09:51,717
OKAY.

233
00:09:56,597 --> 00:09:58,015
COMPATIBLE.

234
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:03,312
EVEN IF WE ARE THE ONLY
TWO PEOPLE IN THE PROGRAM.

235
00:10:05,856 --> 00:10:06,690
(KNOCKING)

236
00:10:09,026 --> 00:10:10,611
THANKS, CHESTER.

237
00:10:10,694 --> 00:10:12,321
IT'S GOING TO BE
AMAZING.

238
00:10:12,404 --> 00:10:13,739
I'LL MAKE SURE THAT MARCO
GETS HIS PASSWORD.

239
00:10:23,248 --> 00:10:26,835
BANANA SANDWICH
FOR YOUR THOUGHTS?

240
00:10:26,919 --> 00:10:28,253
NOT ABOUT THAT KID,
ARE THEY?

241
00:10:28,337 --> 00:10:29,296
WHO, CHESTER?

242
00:10:29,379 --> 00:10:30,506
NO. NO.

243
00:10:30,589 --> 00:10:31,924
I'M JUST DISTRACTED
LATELY

244
00:10:32,007 --> 00:10:34,843
'CAUSE I'M ORGANIZING
THIS ENTIRE DANCE.

245
00:10:34,927 --> 00:10:36,512
WITH MARCO.

246
00:10:36,595 --> 00:10:37,930
WHO I'VE SPOKEN TO,
OH I DON'T KNOW,

247
00:10:38,013 --> 00:10:39,640
8 TIMES TODAY.

248
00:10:39,723 --> 00:10:40,891
LOOK, I'M SORRY.

249
00:10:40,974 --> 00:10:43,352
TOMORROW, EVERY SINGLE
DANCE IS YOURS.

250
00:10:43,435 --> 00:10:46,772
YOU'LL GET SICK
OF ALL THE ATTENTION.

251
00:10:46,855 --> 00:10:48,524
I WORK TOMORROW NIGHT.

252
00:10:48,607 --> 00:10:50,359
SO?
ASK FOR IT OFF.

253
00:10:50,442 --> 00:10:52,152
SAY YOUR SICK
OR SOMETHING.

254
00:10:52,236 --> 00:10:52,945
I CAN'T.

255
00:10:53,028 --> 00:10:55,614
GRIM REAPER
WILL FIRE ME.

256
00:10:56,406 --> 00:10:59,326
MY OWN BOYFRIEND
CAN'T MAKE IT TO MY DANCE?

257
00:10:59,409 --> 00:11:00,744
BOYFRIEND?

258
00:11:00,827 --> 00:11:03,539
FUNNY, I THOUGHT
WE WERE JUST DATING.

259
00:11:03,622 --> 00:11:05,249
YOU DON'T WANT ME
TO BE YOUR GIRLFRIEND.

260
00:11:05,332 --> 00:11:07,125
YOU JUST THINK
IT'S WHAT COUPLES DO.

261
00:11:07,209 --> 00:11:08,168
AND YOU'RE NOT GONNA
CONVINCE ME

262
00:11:08,252 --> 00:11:10,128
WITH A STUPID STUFFED LLAMA
FOR 10-YEAR-OLDS.

263
00:11:10,212 --> 00:11:12,422
CRAIG GAVE ME ONE
TWO YEARS AGO.

264
00:11:12,506 --> 00:11:13,757
WHAT? WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

265
00:11:15,676 --> 00:11:17,094
IF YOU CAN'T COMMIT
TO A SIMPLE DANCE,

266
00:11:17,177 --> 00:11:19,263
HOW CAN YOU COMMIT TO ME?

267
00:11:19,972 --> 00:11:22,266
SPINNER:
MANNY? WHAT-

268
00:11:25,811 --> 00:11:27,563
RADITCH:
I LOVE DEGRASSI.

269
00:11:27,646 --> 00:11:30,941
IT'S BEEN SUCH AN IMPORTANT
PART OF MY LIFE.

270
00:11:31,024 --> 00:11:33,735
BUT ALL GOOD THINGS
MUST COME TO AN END.

271
00:11:33,819 --> 00:11:36,321
I LOOK FORWARD TO THE
CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES

272
00:11:36,405 --> 00:11:38,490
THAT ARE SET OUT BEFORE ME.

273
00:11:38,574 --> 00:11:41,994
AS DOES YOUR NEW ACTING
PRINCIPAL, MS. HATZILAKOS.

274
00:11:42,077 --> 00:11:42,911
(APPLAUSE)

275
00:11:44,121 --> 00:11:45,247
HATZILAKOS:
THANK YOU, MR. RADITCH.

276
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:48,250
AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR MANY
YEARS OF DEDICATED SERVICE

277
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:50,669
TO THIS SCHOOL AND STUDENTS.

278
00:11:51,545 --> 00:11:53,964
YOU DUMPED SPIN
BECAUSE OF A DANCE?

279
00:11:54,047 --> 00:11:54,965
I DIDN'T DUMP SPIN

280
00:11:55,048 --> 00:11:57,050
BECAUSE WE WERE
NEVER GOING OUT.

281
00:11:57,134 --> 00:11:59,094
HE'S HEARTBROKEN.
YOU KNOW THAT, RIGHT?

282
00:11:59,178 --> 00:12:00,345
SO AM I,
BUT...

283
00:12:01,013 --> 00:12:02,055
IT WASN'T WORKING OUT.

284
00:12:02,139 --> 00:12:03,098
AND WE NEED TO MOVE ON.

285
00:12:03,182 --> 00:12:04,016
WHY?

286
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:08,562
(AHEM) MARCO?

287
00:12:10,647 --> 00:12:11,982
THE UH, PRESENT?

288
00:12:12,733 --> 00:12:13,734
MARCO:
YEAH...

289
00:12:17,404 --> 00:12:19,615
THANK YOU. THANKS.

290
00:12:19,698 --> 00:12:21,241
THIS IS ON BEHALF
OF ALL THE STUDENTS

291
00:12:21,325 --> 00:12:22,659
HERE AT DEGRASSI,
MR. RADITCH.

292
00:12:22,743 --> 00:12:23,952
WE'RE GONNA MISS YOU.

293
00:12:24,036 --> 00:12:25,495
THANK YOU. THANKS.

294
00:12:26,538 --> 00:12:27,372
(APPLAUSE)

295
00:12:29,666 --> 00:12:30,709
THANKS.

296
00:12:31,335 --> 00:12:32,211
PLEASE. THANK YOU.

297
00:13:05,911 --> 00:13:07,621
SIMPSON:
STUDENTS ARE REMINDED
THAT TONIGHT'S CUPID DANCE

298
00:13:07,704 --> 00:13:09,081
STARTS AT 7:00 P.M.

299
00:13:09,164 --> 00:13:10,582
BE THERE.

300
00:13:16,296 --> 00:13:17,506
I HAD TO GO HOME
AND CHANGE.

301
00:13:17,589 --> 00:13:20,676
SO WHERE'S MY
TRUE LOVE-O-GRAM?

302
00:13:21,301 --> 00:13:22,511
DANNY?

303
00:13:22,594 --> 00:13:23,762
OH, MANUELLA?

304
00:13:23,846 --> 00:13:25,097
I USED TO
BABYSIT YOU.

305
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:28,475
SO LET'S TAKE IT
TO THE NEXT LEVEL.

306
00:13:28,559 --> 00:13:29,893
I WAS SUPPOSED
TO GET CHESTER.

307
00:13:29,977 --> 00:13:31,520
MARCO:
FIRST OF ALL - OW!

308
00:13:31,603 --> 00:13:32,187
AND SECOND?

309
00:13:32,271 --> 00:13:34,481
THE COMPUTER DECIDES,
MANNY, NOT YOU.

310
00:13:37,776 --> 00:13:39,111
MANNY:
WHY WOULD YOU DO THIS TO ME?

311
00:13:39,778 --> 00:13:41,154
WHY WOULD YOU
DO THIS TO SPIN?

312
00:13:41,238 --> 00:13:42,239
EXCUSE ME?

313
00:13:42,531 --> 00:13:44,658
MARCO:
HE LOVES YOU, OKAY?

314
00:13:44,741 --> 00:13:46,285
AND I KNOW YOU CARE ABOUT HIM.

315
00:13:47,119 --> 00:13:49,788
SO STOP BEING AFRAID OF WHAT
HAPPENED LAST YEAR WITH CRAIG

316
00:13:49,872 --> 00:13:50,998
AND JUST TAKE A CHANCE.

317
00:13:52,749 --> 00:13:54,126
YOU NEEDED TO HEAR IT
FROM SOMEONE.

318
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:58,297
AND YOU NEED TO GET
OVER YOURSELF.

319
00:14:05,554 --> 00:14:07,472
HEY,
CONGRATS ON THE KISMET.

320
00:14:08,473 --> 00:14:09,641
UM, HEY, MANNY.

321
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:10,684
HEY.

322
00:14:11,977 --> 00:14:13,812
SO, CHESTER
I OWE YOU.

323
00:14:14,646 --> 00:14:17,149
YOUR THEME.
YOUR ONE DANCE.

324
00:14:17,232 --> 00:14:19,318
CHESTER:
YOU'RE RIGHT.

325
00:14:19,401 --> 00:14:21,278
I'M JUST GOING TO GO
GET A BAG OF CHIPS.

326
00:14:21,361 --> 00:14:23,280
DO WANT ANYTHING,
CHESTER?

327
00:14:23,363 --> 00:14:25,032
NAH.
I'M FINE AS IS.

328
00:14:40,756 --> 00:14:41,715
PARTNER ME, DEL ROSSI.

329
00:14:46,512 --> 00:14:47,471
SO WHO'S
THE LUCKY GUY?

330
00:14:48,347 --> 00:14:50,098
HUH, ISN'T THAT ODD?

331
00:14:50,182 --> 00:14:51,433
IT'S YOU.

332
00:14:52,309 --> 00:14:54,061
AND UH,
WHO DID YOU GET, MR. O?

333
00:14:54,144 --> 00:14:54,520
I'M NOT A STUDENT.

334
00:14:54,603 --> 00:14:56,230
I DIDN'T PARTICIPATE,
PAIGE.

335
00:15:05,531 --> 00:15:06,490
WHAT DO I DO?

336
00:15:06,573 --> 00:15:07,658
DON'T ASK ME.

337
00:15:08,367 --> 00:15:09,368
AS OF NOW, PAIGE,

338
00:15:09,451 --> 00:15:11,245
YOU'RE FRESH OUT
OF MARCO'S FAVOURS, OKAY?

339
00:15:22,548 --> 00:15:23,674
I WAS AT THE DOT

340
00:15:23,757 --> 00:15:25,968
AND I THOUGHT,
I CAN CLEAR PLATES ANYWHERE,

341
00:15:26,051 --> 00:15:29,721
BUT WHERE DO I ORDER ME
ANOTHER MANNY?

342
00:15:31,723 --> 00:15:32,683
I TOLD YOU-

343
00:15:32,766 --> 00:15:33,851
I KNOW, I KNOW.

344
00:15:33,934 --> 00:15:35,811
I SHOULD'VE TAKEN
THE NIGHT OFF.

345
00:15:35,894 --> 00:15:37,646
PLUS GIVEN YOU
A REAL REASON

346
00:15:37,729 --> 00:15:40,691
WHY I WANT US
TO BE OFFICIAL.

347
00:15:42,484 --> 00:15:45,696
I WANT YOU TO BE MY GIRLFRIEND
BECAUSE WE HAVE FUN.

348
00:15:45,779 --> 00:15:47,948
BECAUSE YOU MAKE ME HAPPY.

349
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:51,994
AND I WANT YOU TO BE
MY GIRLFRIEND BECAUSE...

350
00:15:52,077 --> 00:15:54,746
I CAN'T IMAGINE IT
ANY OTHER WAY.

351
00:15:56,915 --> 00:15:58,750
YOU'RE ON
THE REBOUND.

352
00:15:58,834 --> 00:16:00,002
THAT DOESN'T
MEAN ANYTHING.

353
00:16:00,085 --> 00:16:01,211
IT MEANS EVERYTHING.

354
00:16:01,295 --> 00:16:02,462
REBOUNDS NEVER
WORK OUT.

355
00:16:02,546 --> 00:16:03,380
SO WE END IT NOW

356
00:16:03,463 --> 00:16:06,466
BEFORE EITHER OF US
