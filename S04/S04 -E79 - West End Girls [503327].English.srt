00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:19,902
RIGHT.
WELL, EMMA...

355
00:14:19,985 --> 00:14:21,320
EMMA... SAID,

356
00:14:22,196 --> 00:14:25,324
SHE WOULD DIE IF SHE DIDN'T
GET HER HANDS ON YOU.

357
00:14:25,407 --> 00:14:26,742
EMMA:
NO, I-

358
00:14:30,412 --> 00:14:31,205
KEVIN:
OH MY GOD,
MS. RYAN.

359
00:14:31,288 --> 00:14:32,539
IF I KNEW YOU WERE TAKING ME
TO THE PROM,

360
00:14:32,623 --> 00:14:35,250
I WOULD'VE TOTALLY
GOTTEN YOU A CORSAGE.

361
00:14:35,334 --> 00:14:37,169
NO, I'M HERE TO HELP YOU
CHECK THE PLACE OUT.

362
00:14:37,252 --> 00:14:39,671
IT DOESN'T QUALIFY
AS A DATE.

363
00:14:39,755 --> 00:14:40,339
THAT'S SO WEIRD.

364
00:14:40,422 --> 00:14:42,466
MY PROM DATE SAID
THE EXACT SAME THING.

365
00:14:48,889 --> 00:14:51,099
MANNY:
OH MY GOD!

366
00:14:51,183 --> 00:14:52,434
YOU'RE INDESTRUCTIBLE!

367
00:14:52,518 --> 00:14:54,019
I'M GLAD YOU'RE HERE,

368
00:14:54,102 --> 00:14:54,436
BECAUSE-

369
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:56,855
WHAT ARE YOU
WEARING?

370
00:14:58,607 --> 00:15:00,108
LIBERTY:
ONCE THE BALLOT'S FILLED OUT,

371
00:15:00,192 --> 00:15:01,443
IT NEEDS TO BE
HANDED IT IN.

372
00:15:01,527 --> 00:15:03,445
I CANNOT BELIEVE.

373
00:15:04,905 --> 00:15:06,448
JT:
MAYBE YOU TWO CAN BE
THE WORLD'S FIRST

374
00:15:06,532 --> 00:15:08,825
MATCHING PROM QUEEN SET,
HUH?

375
00:15:08,909 --> 00:15:11,662
LIKE SOCKS OR MITTENS
OR BOOKENDS.

376
00:15:11,745 --> 00:15:13,664
WE'RE NOT BOOKENDS.

377
00:15:13,747 --> 00:15:16,792
PAIGE:
WHAT I WAS GOING
TO SAY WAS...

378
00:15:16,875 --> 00:15:18,460
GOOD LUCK.

MANNY SANTOS.

400
00:16:28,739 --> 00:16:30,449
OH, WE ROCKED
THE PLACE OUT!

401
00:16:30,532 --> 00:16:32,659
DID YOU JUST SAY
ROCKED OUT?

402
00:16:32,743 --> 00:16:33,702
HEY, NO LIP

403
00:16:33,785 --> 00:16:36,705
OR I'LL SMOTHER YOU
IN SWEAT.

404
00:16:40,042 --> 00:16:43,420
I'M GOING TO MISS YOU
SO MUCH.

405
00:16:43,504 --> 00:16:46,590
BUT THE SHOW
WENT REALLY GREAT.

406
00:16:49,009 --> 00:16:50,552
THERE WAS
A MOMENT UP THERE?

407
00:16:50,636 --> 00:16:52,888
WHEN I THOUGHT
TO MYSELF

408
00:16:52,971 --> 00:16:55,224
I HAVE NOTHING LEFT
TO PROVE.

409
00:16:55,307 --> 00:16:56,266
NOW I'M READY
TO GO TO ENGLAND

410
00:16:56,350 --> 00:16:58,352
AND TRY SOME
NEW THINGS.

411
00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:01,438
RIGHT.

412
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:10,822
YOU KNOW I'VE WANTED TO GO
SINCE I WAS A KID.

413
00:17:10,906 --> 00:17:12,282
SINCE YOU SAW
MARY POPPINS.

414
00:17:12,366 --> 00:17:13,450
I KNOW.

415
00:17:15,702 --> 00:17:16,703
IT'S GREAT.

416
00:17:16,787 --> 00:17:18,789
IT'S REALLY GREAT.

417
00:17:20,541 --> 00:17:21,291
COME ON, YOU.

418
00:17:21,375 --> 00:17:22,167
LET'S GET

419
00:17:22,251 --> 00:17:24,711

420
00:17:24,795 --> 00:17:27,297

YOU ALL RIGHT?

437
00:18:24,229 --> 00:18:26,982
WE'RE GONNA DEFINITELY BE
SHOOTING HERE, MS. RYAN.

438
00:18:27,065 --> 00:18:29,735
YOU SHOULD GO
AND PUT ON A NEW GOWN.

439
00:18:35,073 --> 00:18:35,908
(LAUGHING)

440
00:18:46,919 --> 00:18:47,669
KEVIN:
HEY, I KNOW THAT KID.

441
00:18:47,753 --> 00:18:49,379
HEY KID! GET OFF MY SET!

442
00:18:49,463 --> 00:18:50,964
SORRY.
ARE YOU WORKING HERE?

443
00:18:51,048 --> 00:18:54,092
KEVIN:
NO, WE'RE NOT.
THAT'S OKAY.

444
00:18:54,176 --> 00:18:55,177
DUDE, I NEVER WORK.

445
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:55,719
AND THAT THING,

446
00:18:55,802 --> 00:18:57,471
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
HOW THAT OPERATES.

447
00:18:57,554 --> 00:18:58,597
YOU EVER SEEN ONE
OF MY FLICKS?

448
00:18:58,680 --> 00:18:59,681
KINDA SHOWS.

449
00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:00,766
CRAIG:
I LIKE THE ONE

450
00:19:00,849 --> 00:19:02,684
WHERE THE GUYS HANG
OUTSIDE THE 7-ELEVEN.

451
00:19:02,768 --> 00:19:05,437
YEAH, THAT KINDA
NARROWS IT DOWN A BIT.

452
00:19:05,521 --> 00:19:06,980
WHY AREN'T YOU INSIDE
PROMING IT UP?

453
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:10,275
YOUR MUSIC GUY
HATED US

454
00:19:10,359 --> 00:19:13,487
AND NOW ASHLEY'S
GOING TO ENGLAND.

455
00:19:13,570 --> 00:19:14,821
UH, WHAT I'M HEARING
IS GIRL TROUBLE, DUDE.

456
00:19:14,905 --> 00:19:16,573
IT ALWAYS COMES DOWN
TO GIRL TROUBLE.

457
00:19:16,657 --> 00:19:18,075
I CAN FEEL YOUR PAIN, SIR.

458
00:19:18,158 --> 00:19:19,326
YOU'VE BEEN THROUGH THIS?

459
00:19:19,409 --> 00:19:20,202
KEVIN:
GIRL TROUBLE?

460
00:19:20,285 --> 00:19:21,703
DUDE, I'M A FAT GUY
FROM NEW JERSEY.

461
00:19:21,787 --> 00:19:23,330
YEAH,
I'VE HAD GIRL TROUBLE.

462
00:19:23,413 --> 00:19:25,415
EVEN WHEN I WRITE
AND DIRECT THE MOVIES,

463
00:19:25,499 --> 00:19:26,625
I NEVER GET THE GIRL.

464
00:19:26,708 --> 00:19:28,627
I ALWAYS WIND UP WITH JAY.

465
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:30,587
IN SOME CASES,
A MONKEY.

466
00:19:30,671 --> 00:19:32,297
WELL, YOU KNOW
WHAT I'VE FOUND...

467
00:19:32,381 --> 00:19:34,758
WHEN MY HEART GETS BROKEN,

468
00:19:34,842 --> 00:19:36,343
JUST THROW YOURSELF
INTO WORK, MAN.

469
00:19:36,426 --> 00:19:38,387
GO HOME
START WRITING A SONG.

470
00:19:38,470 --> 00:19:40,472
GO WRITE A SONG
FOR A MOVIE.

471
00:19:40,556 --> 00:19:43,892
A MOVIE DIRECTED BY
FAT STAR WARS NERD

472
00:19:43,976 --> 00:19:46,687
WHO HANGS AROUND HIGH SCHOOLS
DURING PROM,

473
00:19:46,770 --> 00:19:48,188
TALKS TO BROKEN-HEARTED
MUSICIAN TYPES...

474
00:19:48,272 --> 00:19:50,607
DUDE, WHAT PART OF THIS
DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND?

475
00:19:50,691 --> 00:19:52,234
YOUR MUSIC GUY SAID
I SUCK.

476
00:19:52,317 --> 00:19:53,110
UH, DUDE.

477
00:19:53,193 --> 00:19:54,695
HE'S PERSONA NON-GRADA.

478
00:19:54,778 --> 00:19:56,196
THAT DUDE'S GOT NO CREDIBILITY
WHATSOEVER.

479
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:57,698
THE DAY CREED BROKE UP,

480
00:19:57,781 --> 00:19:58,866
I FOUND HIM
IN A BATHROOM STALL

481
00:19:58,949 --> 00:19:59,867
AND HE WAS CRYING.

482
00:19:59,950 --> 00:20:00,993
CRYING, DUDE!

483
00:20:01,577 --> 00:20:04,454
BESIDES, IT'S MY MOVIE.
IT'S NOT HIS MOVIE.

484
00:20:04,538 --> 00:20:06,290
YOU'RE LOOKING AT ME
ALL INCREDULOUS LIKE.

485
00:20:06,373 --> 00:20:07,875
DUDE, DID NOT SEE ME
TEN MINUTES AGO?

486
00:20:07,958 --> 00:20:10,419
I FLAT OUT CAUGHT
THE PROM QUEEN.

487
00:20:10,502 --> 00:20:12,379
YOU KNOW WHAT KIND OF A HUGE
KARMIC DEBT THAT IS

488
00:20:12,462 --> 00:20:13,755
TO PAY BACK?

489
00:20:13,839 --> 00:20:15,215
I GOT TO PAY IF FORWARD,
MAN.

490
00:20:15,299 --> 00:20:16,800
I'M GONNA PAY YOU.

491
00:20:28,270 --> 00:20:30,105
I BROUGHT PINS.

492
00:20:30,856 --> 00:20:31,523
IF IT WERE LEGAL

493
00:20:31,607 --> 00:20:34,151
I'D OFFER YOU
PAINKILLERS TOO.

494
00:20:34,234 --> 00:20:36,320
MANNY:
WHERE DO YOU GET OFF
COMING IN HERE?!

495
00:20:36,403 --> 00:20:38,697
HOW CAN YOU
EVEN TALK TO ME?!

496
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:40,240
HI,
YOU BROKE MY LEG!

497
00:20:40,324 --> 00:20:41,783
YOU MADE ME

I DON'T REMEMBER,

502
00:20:48,957 --> 00:20:50,083
BUT YOU STARTED IT!

503
00:20:50,167 --> 00:20:51,084
I'LL KEEP GOING!

504
00:20:51,168 --> 00:20:52,920
YOU STRESS ME
AT SPIRIT SQUAD,

505
00:20:53,003 --> 00:20:55,589
YOU MAKE ME LOOK
LIKE A FULL-FAT SPAZ!

506
00:20:55,672 --> 00:20:57,090
SHUT UP!

507
00:20:57,174 --> 00:20:59,343
YOU'RE JUST JEALOUS!

508
00:21:00,886 --> 00:21:02,387
YEAH, RIGHT.

509
00:21:13,190 --> 00:21:15,108
DON'T DRINK ANYTHING
ELSE TONIGHT.

510
00:21:15,192 --> 00:21:17,945
THE GIRLS WENT OUT
FOR LAXATIVES.

511
00:21:20,948 --> 00:21:22,533
THANKS FOR THE TIP.

512
00:21:25,869 --> 00:21:27,663
WELL, AT LEAST IT'S SUMMER NOW.

513
00:21:29,206 --> 00:21:30,165
YEAH.

SUMMER'S GOOD.
