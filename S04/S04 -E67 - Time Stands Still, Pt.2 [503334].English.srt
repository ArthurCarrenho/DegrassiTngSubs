1
00:00:07,591 --> 00:00:08,258
(CRYING)

2
00:00:11,595 --> 00:00:13,138
EMMA:
THEY CAN'T AIR THE QUIZ SHOW,
TOBY.

3
00:00:13,222 --> 00:00:13,597
TOBY:
YES THEY CAN.

4
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:15,974
THEY JUST CUT BEFORE
THE PAINT POURS ON RICK.

5
00:00:16,058 --> 00:00:19,853
JT:
WHICH IS OFFICIALLY MY NEW
FAVOURITE MENTAL IMAGE.

6
00:00:19,937 --> 00:00:20,646
TOBY:
YOU KNOW WHAT?

7
00:00:20,729 --> 00:00:21,355
YOU WOULDN'T THINK
IT WAS SO FUNNY

8
00:00:21,438 --> 00:00:22,397
IF IT HAPPENED TO YOU.

9
00:00:22,481 --> 00:00:25,025
DANNY:
(CHUCKLES) I WOULD.

10
00:00:25,108 --> 00:00:27,945
AND SPEAKING
OF HYSTERICAL IMAGES...

11
00:00:30,489 --> 00:00:32,658
TOBY:
WHAT'S RICK DOING BACK
AT SCHOOL?

12
00:00:32,741 --> 00:00:34,785
WE SHOULD GO TALK TO HIM.

13
00:00:35,452 --> 00:00:37,204
EMMA:
GO RIGHT AHEAD.

14
00:00:39,665 --> 00:00:40,624
TOBY:
RICK.

15
00:00:41,792 --> 00:00:42,709
RICK!

16
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:45,629
LOOK, RADITCH
IS GOING SUPERNOVA.

17
00:00:45,712 --> 00:00:47,214
HE'S GONNA FIND OUT
WHO DID IT.

18
00:00:47,297 --> 00:00:48,549
AND WHAT?

19
00:00:48,632 --> 00:00:50,926
GIVE THEM DETENTION?

20
00:00:51,009 --> 00:00:52,594
I'M JUST SAYING,

21
00:00:52,678 --> 00:00:53,053
I'M SURE
HE'D BE COOL

22
00:00:53,136 --> 00:00:56,056
IF YOU SKIPPED
THE REST OF THE DAY.

23
00:00:56,139 --> 00:00:58,642
TOBY,
THIS IS THE ONE TIME

24
00:00:58,725 --> 00:01:00,185
I ACTUALLY WANT
TO BE AT SCHOOL.

00:01:15,576 --> 00:01:18,412

IN TWENTY-FIVE YEARS
AS AN EDUCATOR,

37
00:01:53,488 --> 00:01:55,449
I HAVE NEVER,
NEVER BEEN SO EMBARRASSED

38
00:01:55,532 --> 00:01:57,284
TO BE ASSOCIATED
WITH THIS SCHOOL.

39
00:01:57,367 --> 00:01:59,203
WHOMEVER WAS RESPONSIBLE
FOR THE INCIDENT THIS MORNING,

40
00:01:59,286 --> 00:02:02,289
SHOULD BE ASHAMED
OF THEMSELVES.

41
00:02:02,372 --> 00:02:03,457
AND LET ME ASSURE YOU

42
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:05,417
THAT THE PERPETRATOR
OR PERPETRATORS

43
00:02:05,501 --> 00:02:07,085
RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS
WILL BE FOUND OUT

44
00:02:07,169 --> 00:02:08,837
AND PUNISHED SEVERELY.

45
00:02:08,921 --> 00:02:10,339
IF ANYONE HAS ANY INFORMATION,

46
00:02:10,422 --> 00:02:12,341
PLEASE SPEAK TO ME IMMEDIATELY.

47
00:02:12,424 --> 00:02:14,426
I ASSURE YOUR CONFIDENTIALITY.

48
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:15,844
THANK YOU.

49
00:02:18,388 --> 00:02:20,516
SO, BACK TO 1984.

50
00:02:20,599 --> 00:02:21,266
LET'S DISCUSS BIG BROTHER...

51
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:23,977
SO, HOW'S BIG
YELLOW LOSER?

52
00:02:24,061 --> 00:02:25,896
THAT'S REALLY NICE,
JT.

53
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:29,274
I HOPE HE JUST GETS
THE HINT AND LEAVES.

54
00:02:29,358 --> 00:02:33,862
AND YOU'LL HAVE TO FIND
A NEW GAMER-GEEK FRIEND.

55
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:39,034
AND THEN WHEN THE FEATHERS
CAME DOWN...

56
00:02:39,117 --> 00:02:39,868
OH... (KISS)

57
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:41,787
LOOK, CUT THE GUY
SOME SLACK, SPIN.

58
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:43,080
HE'S NOT THAT BAD.

59
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:44,957
YEAH, OKAY.

60
00:02:45,499 --> 00:02:46,708
OH, CHICKEN BOY.

61
00:02:46,792 --> 00:02:48,460
OH, CHICKEN BOY.

62
00:02:48,544 --> 00:02:50,671
I LOVE YOUR
WEALTH OF KNOWLEDGE

63
00:02:50,754 --> 00:02:52,714
AND I, I LOVE YOU.

64
00:02:52,798 --> 00:02:54,258
I'M GLAD YOU THINK
THIS IS FUNNY.

65
00:02:55,217 --> 00:02:56,718
DID YOU SEE THE GUYS FACE?

66
00:02:56,802 --> 00:02:58,303
DEFINITION OF FUNNY.

67
00:03:00,305 --> 00:03:01,348
WHAT KIND OF PERSON
DOES THAT?

68
00:03:01,932 --> 00:03:03,600
ONE: A GENIUS.

69
00:03:04,393 --> 00:03:06,353
AND TWO:
IF YOU RAT ON ME-

70
00:03:06,436 --> 00:03:07,437
WHAT?

71
00:03:08,313 --> 00:03:11,108
NO, REALLY?
WHAT'RE YOU GONNA DO?

72
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:12,526
YEAH, THAT'S
WHAT I THOUGHT.

73
00:03:12,609 --> 00:03:13,527
LOOK,
SAVE THE BULLY CRAP

74
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:16,405
FOR SOMEONE WHO
WON'T FIGHT BACK.

75
00:03:16,488 --> 00:03:18,657
AND YOU BETTER DO SOMETHING
ABOUT IT NOW!

76
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:19,741
BEFORE I DO.

77
00:03:24,162 --> 00:03:25,455
SPINNER:
WHAT?!

78
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:28,917
(PAINED GROANS)

79
00:03:29,001 --> 00:03:31,420
MR. ARMSTRONG:
HEY! HEY! HEY!

80
00:03:33,088 --> 00:03:35,340
SAVE IT FOR THE GAME,
GUYS.

81
00:03:44,766 --> 00:03:46,059
CAITLIN:
BUT THIS IS YOUR HOME.

82
00:03:46,143 --> 00:03:48,187
I MEAN, WHAT ABOUT CRAIG
AND ANGELA?

83
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:51,148
CRAIG, AND ANGELA AND I
CAN LIVE IN A SMALLER PLACE.

84
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:52,608
IT'S EITHER THAT
OR THE DEALERSHIP.

85
00:03:53,192 --> 00:03:53,817
YEAH, BUT-

86
00:03:53,901 --> 00:03:55,068
JOEY:
YEAH, BUT...
YOU KNOW,

87
00:03:55,152 --> 00:03:56,862
IF THERE WAS A WAY
THAT I COULD KEEP BOTH,

88
00:03:56,945 --> 00:03:58,322
BELIEVE ME,
I'D BE ALL FOR IT.

89
00:04:02,826 --> 00:04:06,413
I GOT TO HEAD BACK
TO THE DEALERSHIP.

90
00:04:08,165 --> 00:04:09,333
BUT WE'RE ON FOR COFFEE
LATER, RIGHT?

91
00:04:10,334 --> 00:04:11,293
YEAH.

92
00:04:15,047 --> 00:04:16,715
JOEY:
MAKE YOURSELF AT HOME.

93
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:17,799
WHILE I STILL HAVE ONE.

94
00:04:25,682 --> 00:04:26,517
(LAUGHTER)

95
00:04:41,406 --> 00:04:45,577
LOOK, I KNOW WE'RE
NOT EXACTLY BEST FRIENDS.

96
00:04:48,789 --> 00:04:52,000
BUT I WANTED TO SAY THAT

97
00:04:52,084 --> 00:04:56,380
I THOUGHT THE WHOLE PAINT
AND FEATHERS JOB WAS SICKENING.

98
00:04:57,172 --> 00:04:58,173
IT WAS REALLY CHILDISH.

99
00:05:05,722 --> 00:05:06,557
I'M SORRY...

100
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:10,644
FOR HURTING TERRI.

101
00:05:28,203 --> 00:05:28,787
(SIGHS)

102
00:05:45,095 --> 00:05:46,805
CAITLIN:
KNOCK KNOCK.

103
00:05:48,432 --> 00:05:49,099
CAITLIN.

104
00:05:50,225 --> 00:05:51,476
YOU'RE... HERE.

105
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:54,396
I GOT JUST BACK
THIS MORNING...

106
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:56,315
TO FIND JOEY'S HOUSE
FOR SALE

107
00:05:56,398 --> 00:05:57,649
AND YOUR NAME ON THE SIGN.

108
00:05:58,567 --> 00:05:59,568
LOOK, BEFORE YOU
SAY ANYTHING,

109
00:05:59,651 --> 00:06:01,195
I'M JUST HELPING JOE
OUT AS A FAVOR.

110
00:06:01,278 --> 00:06:02,196
NO STRINGS ATTACHED.

111
00:06:02,279 --> 00:06:04,198
SO YOU DON'T NEED
TO WORRY ABOUT US.

112
00:06:04,489 --> 00:06:05,365
HOW MUCH IS HE ASKING?

113
00:06:06,575 --> 00:06:08,076
FOUR HUNDRED.
WHY?

114
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:10,662
HOW DOES
THREE FIFTY SOUND?

115
00:06:11,246 --> 00:06:13,874
SOUNDS LIKE FIFTY THOUSAND
LESS THAN THE HOUSE IS WORTH.

116
00:06:15,417 --> 00:06:16,793
ALL RIGHT,
THREE SEVENTY-FIVE.

117
00:06:19,046 --> 00:06:20,297
DOES JOE KNOW ABOUT THIS?

118
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:21,548
CAITLIN:
NOT YET.

119
00:06:21,632 --> 00:06:23,467
AND UNTIL IT'S A DONE DEAL,
I PREFER HE NOT.

120
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:24,801
SO... IF HE ASKS,

121
00:06:25,427 --> 00:06:26,720
JUST TELL HIM ITS
AN ANONYMOUS OFFER.

122
00:06:37,814 --> 00:06:39,483
SYDNEY, IT'S BEEN AN UNEXPECTED
PLEASURE.

123
00:07:14,351 --> 00:07:17,145
SPINNER:
HEY, JAY, LISTEN.

124
00:07:17,229 --> 00:07:18,689
RADITCH KNOWS,
MAN.

125
00:07:24,194 --> 00:07:25,529
ABOUT JIMMY?

126
00:07:25,612 --> 00:07:28,282
YEAH. I'M SURPRISED NOBODY'S
FIGURED IT OUT YET.

127
00:07:28,365 --> 00:07:29,283
DUDE!

128
00:07:33,203 --> 00:07:35,581
JIMMY SET THE WHOLE
THING UP PERFECTLY.

129
00:07:35,664 --> 00:07:39,042
THE WAY HE GOT THOSE EASY
SPORTS QUESTIONS WRONG?

130
00:07:39,126 --> 00:07:41,003
YEAH, AND MADE SURE
PSYCHO-BOY

131
00:07:41,086 --> 00:07:43,964
WAS ALONE
IN THE FINAL ROUND.

132
00:07:44,047 --> 00:07:44,631
NEVER WOULD
HAVE HAPPENED

133
00:07:44,715 --> 00:07:47,551
WITHOUT A MAN
ON THE INSIDE?

134
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:14,661
HOW ARE YOU
HOLDING UP?

135
00:08:14,745 --> 00:08:15,662
GOOD.

136
00:08:16,914 --> 00:08:18,165
THAT'S GOOD.

137
00:08:18,248 --> 00:08:20,792
KIND OF SURPRISED TO SEE YOU
HERE THIS AFTERNOON.

138
00:08:20,876 --> 00:08:23,128
YEAH.
I BET YOU ARE.

139
00:08:23,212 --> 00:08:27,007
JIMMY:
LOOK, I'M REALLY SORRY ABOUT
EVERYTHING, OKAY?

140
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:28,967
AND IF THOSE GUYS
GIVE YOU ANY MORE PROBLEMS,

141
00:08:29,051 --> 00:08:30,093
I GOT YOUR BACK.

142
00:08:30,177 --> 00:08:31,512
LIKE YOU STABBED ME
IN THE BACK.

143
00:08:31,595 --> 00:08:32,513
WHAT?

144
00:08:33,263 --> 00:08:34,681
YOU SET
THE WHOLE THING UP.

145
00:08:34,765 --> 00:08:36,808
JIMMY:
RICK, COME ON.
I DEFENDED YOU!

146
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:41,772
IS THAT REAL?

147
00:08:41,855 --> 00:08:42,356
THE WHOLE TIME

148
00:08:42,439 --> 00:08:45,442
YOU PRETENDED TO BE
MY FRIEND.

149
00:08:47,611 --> 00:08:49,780
YOU MADE ME DO THIS!

150
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:55,827
(GUNSHOT)

151
00:08:55,911 --> 00:08:56,286
AHHH!

152
00:09:12,177 --> 00:09:14,304
J-J-JIMMY!

153
00:09:34,408 --> 00:09:35,158
HI EMMA.

154
00:09:37,035 --> 00:09:38,662
SORRY I KISSED YOU.

155
00:09:40,831 --> 00:09:41,290
SEAN:
HE GOT A GUN.

156
00:09:41,373 --> 00:09:42,082
OKAY. LET'S GO.

157
00:09:42,499 --> 00:09:43,417
DON'T TURN AWAY FROM ME!

158
00:09:50,007 --> 00:09:51,133
I'M GLAD I FOUND YOU,
EMMA.

159
00:09:53,093 --> 00:09:54,761
YOU MADE MY LIST.

160
00:09:54,845 --> 00:09:57,431
TOBY:
RICK, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

161
00:09:59,391 --> 00:10:01,059
YOU FLIRTED WITH ME.

162
00:10:01,852 --> 00:10:02,811
I THOUGHT YOU LIKED ME,

163
00:10:02,895 --> 00:10:05,480
BUT THAT WAS SOMETHING ELSE.

164
00:10:09,151 --> 00:10:11,695
SEAN:
JUST PUT THE GUN DOWN, OKAY.

165
00:10:11,778 --> 00:10:13,322
ANYTHING ELSE IS JUST GOING
TO MAKE YOUR LIFE WORSE.

166
00:10:14,364 --> 00:10:15,866
IT CAN'T GET ANY WORSE.

167
00:10:18,076 --> 00:10:20,162
SEAN:
BELIEVE ME, IT CAN.

168
00:10:21,747 --> 00:10:22,372
I KNOW.

169
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:29,213
WE'LL FIGURE IT ALL OUT, OKAY?

170
00:10:33,926 --> 00:10:34,927
WE'LL FIGURE THIS ALL OUT.

171
00:10:37,513 --> 00:10:38,514
IT'S TOO LATE.

172
00:10:38,597 --> 00:10:39,348
NO.

173
00:10:43,101 --> 00:10:44,144
I ALREADY SHOT SOMEONE.

174
00:10:46,438 --> 00:10:48,232
(STRUGGLING GRUNTS)

175
00:10:48,315 --> 00:10:48,732
STOP!

176
00:10:49,608 --> 00:10:50,359
(GUNSHOT)

177
00:10:54,321 --> 00:10:55,447
(FRIGHTENED SOB)

178
00:11:02,204 --> 00:11:02,871
(SIRENS)

179
00:11:08,085 --> 00:11:09,670
MR. RADITCH:
AGAIN, REMAIN IN YOUR
CLASSROOMS

180
00:11:09,753 --> 00:11:11,213
UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE.

181
00:11:11,296 --> 00:11:12,965
ABSOLUTELY NO ONE IS TO LEAVE,

182
00:11:13,048 --> 00:11:14,883
ACCORDING TO LOCK-DOWN
PROTOCOL.

183
00:11:14,967 --> 00:11:16,426
AND PLEASE REMAIN CALM.

184
00:11:17,469 --> 00:11:19,179
I GOT A PHONE CALL
FROM THE POLICE.

185
00:11:19,263 --> 00:11:20,013
KATE KERWIN.

186
00:11:20,097 --> 00:11:21,056
I HAVE
A KATE KERWIN HERE.

187
00:11:21,139 --> 00:11:22,099
MY STEPSON
TOBY IS-

188
00:11:22,182 --> 00:11:23,058
OVER RADIO:
SHE'S CLEAR.

189
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:34,611
JIMMY?

190
00:11:39,783 --> 00:11:42,452
JOEY:
YOU ARE NOT GOING
TO BELIEVE THIS.

191
00:11:42,536 --> 00:11:45,038
BUT THERE'S ALREADY
AN OFFER ON THE HOUSE.

192
00:11:45,122 --> 00:11:46,707
ALREADY?
THAT'S GREAT!

193
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:48,333
SYDNEY HAS
REALLY COME THROUGH.

194
00:11:48,417 --> 00:11:51,211
AND IT'S TEN PERCENT
ABOVE MARKET VALUE.

195
00:11:51,295 --> 00:11:52,963
TEN PERCENT?
WELL, GO SYDNEY.

196
00:11:53,714 --> 00:11:54,715
I AM BACK IN BUSINESS

197
00:11:54,798 --> 00:11:56,133

198
00:11:56,216 --> 00:11:56,884
NAME A PART OF TORONTO

199
00:11:56,967 --> 00:11:57,634
YOU'VE ALWAYS
WANTED TO LIVE IN.

200
00:11:58,552 --> 00:11:59,720
JOEY.

201
00:11:59,803 --> 00:12:02,181
JOEY:
DANFORTH? BEACHES?

202
00:12:02,264 --> 00:12:03,432
OH WAIT.

203
00:12:04,391 --> 00:12:06,643
YOU JUST BOUGHT A HOUSE
IN RIVERDALE.

204
00:12:08,353 --> 00:12:10,939
I'M MAY NOT BE THE CRAFTIEST
GUY ON THE CORNER,

205
00:12:11,023 --> 00:12:11,690
BUT WHEN MY HOUSE SELLS

206
00:12:11,773 --> 00:12:13,108
IN LESS THEN A DAY
ON THE MARKET?

207
00:12:13,192 --> 00:12:14,484
HOW CAN I LET YOU
LOSE IT?

208
00:12:14,568 --> 00:12:15,402
YOU LOVE THAT HOUSE.

209
00:12:15,944 --> 00:12:17,154
YEAH, I DO.

210
00:12:17,237 --> 00:12:18,363
IT'S GREAT.

211
00:12:18,447 --> 00:12:19,698
ENJOY IT.

212
00:12:20,574 --> 00:12:21,909
CAITLIN:
JOEY... (CELL PHONE RINGS)

213
00:12:21,992 --> 00:12:24,411
CAN'T YOU PUT YOUR MALE PRIDE
ASIDE FOR ONE SECOND?

214
00:12:24,494 --> 00:12:26,705
THIS IS ABOUT ME
RAISING MY OWN FAMILY

215
00:12:26,788 --> 00:12:27,873
AND RUNNING MY OWN BUSINESS.

216
00:12:28,874 --> 00:12:30,083
CAITLIN RYAN.

217
00:12:33,295 --> 00:12:35,005
OH MY GOD.

218
00:12:35,088 --> 00:12:36,590
I'M ON MY WAY.

219
00:12:36,673 --> 00:12:38,383
WE HAVE TO GET
TO DEGRASSI, NOW!

220
00:13:05,577 --> 00:13:07,788
DETECTIVE:
TOBY, WHY DO YOU THINK
HE DID THIS?

221
00:13:07,871 --> 00:13:09,331
TOBY:
I'M SUPPOSED TO KNOW?

222
00:13:09,414 --> 00:13:10,541
LOOK, THE GUY IS A PSYCHO,
OKAY?

223
00:13:10,624 --> 00:13:11,792
HE'S A TOTAL PSYCHO.

224
00:13:11,875 --> 00:13:13,210
WAS HE BULLIED
OR TEASED?

225
00:13:13,293 --> 00:13:14,169
TOBY:
ALWAYS.

226
00:13:14,253 --> 00:13:16,213
EVERY DAY.
CONSTANTLY.

227
00:13:16,713 --> 00:13:18,382
AND WHAT DID YOUR FRIEND DO
WHEN SOMEONE-

228
00:13:18,465 --> 00:13:20,968
TOBY:
LOOK, HE'S NOT MY FRIEND!

229
00:13:21,051 --> 00:13:22,970
HE'S A PSYCHO.
AND HE'S NOT MY FRIEND.

230
00:13:23,053 --> 00:13:24,012
TOBY.

231
00:13:24,346 --> 00:13:25,222
DETECTIVE:
I'LL GIVE YOU SOME TIME.

232
00:13:25,305 --> 00:13:26,473
I'LL BE BACK
IN A FEW MINUTES.

233
00:13:30,727 --> 00:13:33,564
MR. SIMPSON:
HE NEEDED HELP, EMMA.

234
00:13:35,023 --> 00:13:36,567
HE POINTED THE GUN
RIGHT AT ME.

235
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:37,359
OH, HONEY.

236
00:13:39,194 --> 00:13:39,903
MR. RADITCH:
ARCHIE?

237
00:13:41,530 --> 00:13:43,657
NO. I AM BUSY HERE,
IF YOU HADN'T NOTICED.

238
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:44,992
MR. RADITCH:
I'M SORRY.

239
00:13:45,075 --> 00:13:46,410
THEY WANT TO KNOW IF YOU CAN
GET INTO RICK'S EMAIL

240
00:13:46,493 --> 00:13:48,412
TO LOOK FOR SIGNS...
WARNING SIGNS.

241
00:13:51,498 --> 00:13:53,500
OF COURSE.

242
00:13:54,126 --> 00:13:56,336
NOW THE GROUNDBREAKING
20/20 HINDSIGHT POLICY

243
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:57,754
KICKS INTO GEAR.

244
00:14:05,554 --> 00:14:07,556
I HAVE 700 STUDENTS
AND A TEACHING STAFF

245
00:14:07,639 --> 00:14:09,516
THAT I AM RESPONSIBLE
FOR EVERY DAY.

246
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:10,517
DON'T GET ON MY CASE

247
00:14:10,601 --> 00:14:13,645
BECAUSE ONE KID OVERREACTED
TO SOME SPILLED PAINT.

248
00:14:13,729 --> 00:14:15,272
YEAH. ONE KID WHO YOU'VE
PERSONALLY SPOKEN TO TWICE

249
00:14:15,355 --> 00:14:16,023
IN THE LAST TWO DAYS.

250
00:14:16,106 --> 00:14:16,398
BUT DID YOU LISTEN?

251
00:14:16,481 --> 00:14:17,441
OF COURSE I DID.

252
00:14:17,524 --> 00:14:19,359
I BET YOU CAN'T REMEMBER
A WORD HE SAID.

253
00:14:19,443 --> 00:14:20,110
THIS TRAGEDY, DAN,

254
00:14:20,194 --> 00:14:21,195
IT COULD'VE BEEN PREVENTED
IF YOU HADN'T-

255
00:14:21,278 --> 00:14:22,779
ARCHIE!

256
00:14:22,863 --> 00:14:24,489
CAN YOU TWO
DO THIS LATER?

257
00:14:30,829 --> 00:14:33,123
EMMA, THEY'RE GONNA WANT
TO SPEAK TO ALL THE WITNESSES.

258
00:14:34,625 --> 00:14:36,043
I'M SORRY.

259
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:48,222
CAITLIN:
CAITLIN RYAN, CQJH.

260
00:14:48,305 --> 00:14:49,181
CAN YOU TELL US ANYTHING?

261
00:14:49,264 --> 00:14:50,974
WE HAD A FIREARM
SITUATION.

262
00:14:51,058 --> 00:14:52,142
AT LEAST TWO SHOTS
HAVE BEEN FIRED.

263
00:14:52,851 --> 00:14:55,062
THERE IS GUNSHOTS
IN THERE?

264
00:14:55,145 --> 00:14:55,729
MY KID'S IN THERE!

265
00:14:55,812 --> 00:14:57,189
CAN I PLEASE JUST
MAKE SURE HE'S OKAY.

266
00:14:57,272 --> 00:14:59,316
SORRY, SIR.
SCHOOL'S IN LOCK-DOWN.

267
00:15:02,986 --> 00:15:05,239
PAIGE:
OKAY, I HATE NOT KNOWING
WHAT'S GOING ON.

268
00:15:05,322 --> 00:15:06,657
HAZEL:
I KNOW, IT'S BEEN,
LIKE, FOREVER.

269
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:07,699
I NEED TO GO PEE.

270
00:15:07,783 --> 00:15:08,909
ASHLEY:
MAYBE IT'S AN ALARM?

271
00:15:08,992 --> 00:15:10,494
HAZEL:
BOMB SCARE?

272
00:15:11,078 --> 00:15:12,955
NINER MIDTERM PHOBIA
STRIKES AGAIN.

273
00:15:15,666 --> 00:15:16,667
GUYS...

274
00:15:18,502 --> 00:15:19,628
MY MOM HEARD
THERE WAS A SHOOTING.

275
00:15:25,342 --> 00:15:26,176
(KNOCKING)

276
00:15:33,642 --> 00:15:34,685
HAZEL, COULD I SEE YOU
IN THE HALL?

277
00:15:46,196 --> 00:15:48,699
HAZEL,
IT'S ABOUT JIMMY.

278
00:15:50,033 --> 00:15:50,742
NO...

279
00:15:51,785 --> 00:15:52,870
HE WAS SHOT.

280
00:15:52,953 --> 00:15:53,662
NO...

281
00:15:53,745 --> 00:15:54,913
HE'S ON HIS WAY
TO THE HOSPITAL.

282
00:15:54,997 --> 00:15:55,706
NO.

283
00:15:57,499 --> 00:15:59,042
NO.
I NEED TO GO...

284
00:15:59,126 --> 00:15:59,751
NO YOU CAN'T GO.

285
00:15:59,835 --> 00:16:02,462
I NEED TO GO!
I NEED TO GO!

286
00:16:02,546 --> 00:16:05,132
THE LOCK-DOWN WILL BE
OVER SOON, OKAY?

287
00:16:05,215 --> 00:16:05,799
WE'LL GET YOU THERE.

288
00:16:06,592 --> 00:16:07,259
(CRYING)

289
00:16:12,556 --> 00:16:13,974
MR. RADITCH:
PLEASE HEAD STRAIGHT HOME.

290
00:16:14,057 --> 00:16:16,727
DO NOT STOP AT YOUR LOCKERS.
DO NOT LOITER AROUND.

291
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:18,896
WE RECOMMEND YOU NOT SPEAK
TO REPORTERS.

292
00:16:22,441 --> 00:16:23,025
JAY:
JUST RELAX.

293
00:16:23,108 --> 00:16:23,984
EVERYTHING IS GONNA
BE FINE.

294
00:16:24,067 --> 00:16:24,985
WHY DID I GO ALONG
WITH ALL THIS?

295
00:16:25,068 --> 00:16:26,737
I SAID RELAX.

296
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:27,988
YOU'RE ALIVE,
AREN'T YOU?

297
00:16:28,906 --> 00:16:29,573
YO, SPIN!

298
00:16:30,532 --> 00:16:32,492
I THOUGHT THAT
MIGHT HAVE BEEN YOU.

299
00:16:32,576 --> 00:16:35,162
IT WAS JIMMY, MAN.
JIMMY!

300
00:16:35,245 --> 00:16:36,455
THEY'RE GOING TO FIND OUT.
I HAVE TO-

301
00:16:36,538 --> 00:16:37,206
NO!

302
00:16:40,709 --> 00:16:43,504
LOOK, YOU HAVE
TO SHUT UP, OKAY?

303
00:16:43,587 --> 00:16:45,130
HE'S MY BEST FRIEND.

304
00:16:45,214 --> 00:16:46,089
EITHER OUTCOME,

305
00:16:46,173 --> 00:16:49,343
I WOULD SAY HE WAS
YOUR BEST FRIEND.

306
00:16:49,426 --> 00:16:51,803
WE MIGHT'VE
KILLED HIM.

307
00:16:52,930 --> 00:16:55,224
WE DIDN'T
DO ANYTHING.

308
00:16:56,558 --> 00:16:57,601
WE DID.

309
00:17:08,862 --> 00:17:10,364
JOEY:
CRAIG!

310
00:17:12,699 --> 00:17:13,992
CRAIG,
ARE YOU OKAY?

311
00:17:14,076 --> 00:17:14,826
JIMMY GOT SHOT.

312
00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:15,452
WHAT?

313
00:17:17,162 --> 00:17:18,747
RACHEL:
DID YOU KNOW THE VICTIM?

314
00:17:18,830 --> 00:17:19,873
CAITLIN:
RACHEL RHODES?

315
00:17:19,957 --> 00:17:21,291
CRAIG:
DON'T CALL HIM "VICTIM".

316
00:17:21,375 --> 00:17:22,042
HE HAS A NAME.

317
00:17:22,125 --> 00:17:23,544
RACHEL:
WAS HE A TARGET, THOUGH?
WERE YOU?

318
00:17:23,627 --> 00:17:25,379
DID YOU SEE THE SHOOTINGS?

319
00:17:25,462 --> 00:17:26,672
THIS HAS TO STOP
RIGHT NOW.

320
00:17:26,755 --> 00:17:27,756
SHARE, CAITLIN.

321
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:29,341
NO, I'M NOT
COVERING THIS.

322
00:17:29,424 --> 00:17:30,342
WELL, THEN STEP ASIDE

323
00:17:30,425 --> 00:17:32,094
AND LET ME.

324
00:17:32,177 --> 00:17:33,220
CAITLIN:
HERE'S YOUR STORY FOR YOU:

325
00:17:33,303 --> 00:17:34,888
LOCAL INSENSITIVE
REPORTER

326
00:17:34,972 --> 00:17:37,933
PUMMELED BY
FAMOUS COLLEAGUE.

327
00:17:43,605 --> 00:17:44,565
I'M SO GLAD
YOU'RE OKAY.

328
00:17:49,069 --> 00:17:50,195
RACHEL:
YOU WERE THE GUNMAN'S FRIEND?

329
00:17:50,279 --> 00:17:51,989
DO YOU KNOW WHO HE WAS AFTER?
WHY HE DID IT?

330
00:17:52,072 --> 00:17:52,906
TOBY:
I DON'T KNOW.

331
00:17:52,990 --> 00:17:53,991
RACHEL:
DID YOU TRY TO STOP HIM?

332
00:17:54,074 --> 00:17:55,158
TOBY:
WHAT WAS I SUPPOSED TO DO?!

333
00:17:55,242 --> 00:17:56,493
KATE:
LET'S GO.

334
00:17:56,577 --> 00:17:58,161
RACHEL:
DID THE GUNMAN SAY ANYTHING
BEFORE HE DIED?

335
00:18:03,667 --> 00:18:04,334
HE DIED?

336
00:18:07,838 --> 00:18:09,381
SIMPSON:
COME ON, LET'S GO.

337
00:18:24,021 --> 00:18:24,688
(CRYING)

338
00:18:33,030 --> 00:18:34,865
RACHEL:
FOLLOWING THIS AFTERNOON'S
DOUBLE SHOOTING,

339
00:18:34,948 --> 00:18:36,116
ONE STUDENT IS DEAD

340
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:38,452
AND ANOTHER REMAINS
IN SERIOUS CONDITION.

341
00:18:38,535 --> 00:18:40,078
THE SUSPECT,
A 16-YEAR-OLD BOY

342
00:18:40,162 --> 00:18:41,705
WHOSE NAME CANNOT
BE RELEASED,

343
00:18:41,788 --> 00:18:43,498
WAS THE STUDENT FOUND DEAD
AT THE SCENE.

344
00:18:44,333 --> 00:18:46,043
TOBY, MAYBE YOU SHOULD
TURN THAT OFF NOW.

345
00:18:50,214 --> 00:18:52,049
SPIKE:
PEOPLE DO NOT GET SHOT
AT DEGRASSI.

346
00:18:52,132 --> 00:18:53,300
THEY JUST DON'T.

347
00:18:54,301 --> 00:18:57,095
YOU TALK ABOUT DEGRASSI
LIKE IT'S ACHIEVED SAINTHOOD.

348
00:18:57,179 --> 00:18:58,013
IT'S A SCHOOL.

349
00:18:58,096 --> 00:18:59,515
THAT'S MY POINT.

350
00:18:59,598 --> 00:19:02,184
MR. SIMPSON:
LOOK, WE JUST DIDN'T...

351
00:19:02,267 --> 00:19:05,687
NONE OF US TOOK RICK'S BULLYING
SERIOUSLY ENOUGH.

352
00:19:05,771 --> 00:19:07,272
IT'D BE AN UNDERSTATEMENT TO SAY
THAT HE WAS UNPOPULAR.

353
00:19:09,024 --> 00:19:09,858
UNPOPULAR?

354
00:19:10,984 --> 00:19:12,945
