1
00:00:01,710 --> 00:00:04,505
SO YOUR BIG SCREEN
DEBUT, HUH?

2
00:00:04,588 --> 00:00:05,839
ARE YOU NERVOUS?

3
00:00:05,923 --> 00:00:06,965
YOU SEEM A LITTLE
NERVOUS.

4
00:00:08,091 --> 00:00:09,051
IT'S NORMAL

5
00:00:09,134 --> 00:00:11,678
WHEN YOU'RE PLANNING
A WEDDING, RIGHT?

6
00:00:11,762 --> 00:00:12,763
WHAT?!

7
00:00:15,265 --> 00:00:17,267
I ASKED JOEY
TO MARRY ME

8
00:00:17,351 --> 00:00:18,519
AND HE SAID YES.

9
00:00:18,602 --> 00:00:19,770
CONGRATULATIONS!

10
00:00:19,853 --> 00:00:21,939
THAT IS
SO AMAZING!

11
00:00:23,607 --> 00:00:25,108
KEVIN:
ALL RIGHT, FOLKS,
TIME TO SHOOT.

12
00:00:25,192 --> 00:00:26,527
SHOOT- WHOA!

13
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:27,861
THIS IS WHY I CAME UP HERE
TO SHOOT,

14
00:00:27,945 --> 00:00:28,695
SPEAKING OF WHICH,

15
00:00:28,779 --> 00:00:31,198
A CHANCE TO CATCH
CANADIAN CHICKS

16
00:00:31,281 --> 00:00:32,866
EMBRACING LIKE THAT.

17
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:35,035
EVEN IF THE "CHICKS"
ARE ALREADY SPOKEN FOR?

18
00:00:35,118 --> 00:00:36,537
CHRISTINE,
YOU MAY BE SPOKEN FOR,

19
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:37,371
THIS ONE THOUGH...

20
00:00:37,454 --> 00:00:39,164
ASKED JOEY
TO MARRY HER.

21
00:00:39,248 --> 00:00:39,957
I'VE GOTTA CALL EMMA!

22
00:00:39,957 --> 00:00:40,916
EXCUSE ME.

23
00:00:44,503 --> 00:00:45,337
SERIOUSLY?

24
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:47,506
YEAH.

25
00:00:50,175 --> 00:00:51,009
UM... WOW.

26
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:55,430
I MUST BE THE WORST KISSER
IN THE WORLD

27
00:00:55,514 --> 00:00:56,807

00:02:12,466 --> 00:02:15,052
I'M GONNA EAT

00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:15,969

00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:20,474

00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:28,065
DUDE, WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

53
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:29,274
I THOUGHT YOU WERE
GOING TO ENGLAND?

54
00:02:29,358 --> 00:02:32,402
AFTER THE SONG'S DONE
FOR KEVIN SMITH'S MOVIE.

55
00:02:32,486 --> 00:02:33,779
HE'S KINDA BENDING
THE RULES A LITTLE BIT.

56
00:02:33,862 --> 00:02:35,656
HE'S LETTING ME
HANG HERE.

57
00:02:35,739 --> 00:02:37,157
OH, MY EGGS
ARE DONE.

58
00:02:37,241 --> 00:02:39,618
OH, NOBODY KNOWS,
OKAY?

59
00:02:40,244 --> 00:02:42,204
LIPS ARE STEELED.

60
00:02:45,749 --> 00:02:47,251
UM... DUDE, I JUST WANT
TO SAY ABOUT ASH

61
00:02:47,334 --> 00:02:48,836
AND THE WHOLE
BAND THING...

62
00:02:48,919 --> 00:02:50,504
OH, SPIN,
IT'S IN THE PAST.

63
00:02:50,587 --> 00:02:51,880
IT'S LIKE...

64
00:02:51,964 --> 00:02:54,633
IT'S WATER UNDER
THE BRIDGE.

65
00:02:54,716 --> 00:02:55,676
OKAY.

66
00:02:55,759 --> 00:02:57,803
UM... SHE WAS A GOOD
CONTRIBUTION, THOUGH.

67
00:02:57,886 --> 00:02:58,929
I MEAN,
SHE KNEW HER STUFF.

68
00:02:59,012 --> 00:03:00,472
NO.

69
00:03:00,556 --> 00:03:02,307
SHE WAS A VIRUS.

70
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:07,187
SHE GETS HER
WAY INSIDE.

71
00:03:07,271 --> 00:03:08,647
EVERYTHING'S OKAY
FOR A BIT,

72
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:09,940
THEN - BAM! -

73
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:12,442
SHE RIPS IT
ALL APART.

74
00:03:12,526 --> 00:03:14,069
WELL, I'M GONNA BE
IN THE BOILER ROOM.

75
00:03:14,152 --> 00:03:16,113
I GOT WORK TO DO.

76
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:19,533
BUT UH... LIPS SEALED,
MY FRIEND.

77
00:03:19,616 --> 00:03:20,617

78
00:03:23,161 --> 00:03:24,162

KEVIN:
UH... MRS. JOEY?

87
00:03:53,275 --> 00:03:54,651

00:04:00,324 --> 00:04:03,410

YOUR HAND OFF MY KNEE?

91
00:04:03,493 --> 00:04:03,994

00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:05,037

KEVIN:
OKAY, CUT!

110
00:04:51,208 --> 00:04:52,125
IT'S NOT JASON.

111
00:04:52,209 --> 00:04:53,001
THAT'S HIS NAME
IN REAL LIFE.

112
00:04:53,085 --> 00:04:54,461
IT'S JAY IN THE MOVIE.

113
00:04:54,545 --> 00:04:55,629
(FRUSTRATED) GOOD-
IT'S THREE LINES!

114
00:04:55,712 --> 00:04:56,922
CAN'T YOU GET THROUGH
THREE LINES?

115
00:04:57,005 --> 00:04:59,299
I KNOW MY LINES, KEVIN,
I'M JUST-

116
00:04:59,383 --> 00:05:01,593
AFTER 36 TAKES,
I'M LITTLE FLUSTERED.

117
00:05:01,677 --> 00:05:01,969
KEVIN:
YOU KNOW WHAT?

118
00:05:02,052 --> 00:05:03,303
I'M A LITTLE BIT
FLUSTERED.

119
00:05:03,387 --> 00:05:05,138
AND I WOULD ALMOST RATHER
HAVE ANYONE ELSE IN THIS ROOM

120
00:05:05,222 --> 00:05:06,390
DO THE PART EXCEPT YOU.

121
00:05:06,473 --> 00:05:06,932
AS A MATTER OF FACT,

122
00:05:07,015 --> 00:05:08,892
HEY, UH, SLATE GIRL.

123
00:05:08,976 --> 00:05:10,602
WHY DON'T YOU JUMP IN THERE
AND DO THE PART?

124
00:05:11,186 --> 00:05:12,104
DO I GET PAID?

125
00:05:12,187 --> 00:05:13,063
EVEN BETTER THAN THAT,

126
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:14,898
YOU SWING BY MY TRAILER,

127
00:05:14,982 --> 00:05:16,483
WE'LL DO A LITTLE
OPEN MOUTH KISSING.

128
00:05:16,567 --> 00:05:17,317
UH... NO.

129
00:05:17,901 --> 00:05:19,194
KEVIN:
DON'T LISTEN TO THIS FOOL.

130
00:05:19,278 --> 00:05:21,530
IT'S REAL EASY.
JUST JUMP BEHIND THERE,

131
00:05:21,613 --> 00:05:24,199
AND START ACTING LIKE
YOU'RE NOT UP IN YOUR HEAD,

132
00:05:24,283 --> 00:05:25,659
THINKING ABOUT
WEDDING GOWNS.

133
00:05:27,828 --> 00:05:28,912
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

134
00:05:28,996 --> 00:05:30,831
CAITLIN:
MAYBE YOU SHOULD START
ACTING LIKE A DIRECTOR

135
00:05:30,914 --> 00:05:32,583
AND NOT SOME JEALOUS
BOYFRIEND.

136
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:34,668
KEVIN:
YEAH? WELL, MAYBE YOU SHOULD
TRY ACTING LIKE AN ACTRESS

137
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:37,588
INSTEAD OF-
WHATEVER IT IS THE TV-

138
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:39,089
SHE'S GONE.

139
00:05:39,715 --> 00:05:40,299
WELL, JAY,

140
00:05:40,382 --> 00:05:41,508
THAT DOESN'T CUT IT FOR ME

141
00:05:41,592 --> 00:05:43,886
OR FOR ANY OTHER WOMAN
AT THIS SCHOOL.

142
00:05:43,969 --> 00:05:44,469
SO FROM THIS POINT ON-

143
00:05:44,553 --> 00:05:45,679
CRAIG:
KEVIN?

144
00:05:45,762 --> 00:05:46,513
IS KEVIN HERE?

145
00:05:46,597 --> 00:05:47,890
KEVIN:
OH, MY GOD. CUT!

146
00:05:47,973 --> 00:05:48,599
OKAY,
PROBLEM I WAS HAVING

147
00:05:48,682 --> 00:05:50,100
WAS I WAS WRITING
A LOVE SONG.

148
00:05:50,184 --> 00:05:52,519
IT SHOULD BE LIKE A,
LIKE A BREAK-UP.

149
00:05:52,603 --> 00:05:53,604
LIKE LEAVING
HIGH SCHOOL

150
00:05:53,687 --> 00:05:55,189
IS BREAKING UP
WITH YOUR TEEN YEARS.

151
00:05:55,272 --> 00:05:56,148
WHAT DO YOU
THINK?

152
00:05:56,231 --> 00:05:58,400
I THINK YOU GOTTA DO
WHAT YOU GOTTA DO.

153
00:05:58,483 --> 00:06:01,486
CRAIG, WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

154
00:06:04,281 --> 00:06:05,991
SPINNER:
UH, MISTER SMITH?

155
00:06:06,074 --> 00:06:08,285
YEAH? OH MY GOD.
WHO ARE YOU NOW?

156
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:09,036
I'M, I'M SPINNER.

157
00:06:09,119 --> 00:06:10,287
I'M A FRIEND
OF CRAIG'S.

158
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:12,372
WELL, SPINNER,
FRIEND OF CRAIG'S,

159
00:06:12,456 --> 00:06:14,041
WHAT IS CRAIG
DOING HERE

160
00:06:14,124 --> 00:06:15,000
INSTEAD OF BEING
IN ENGLAND

161
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:17,461
WHERE HE'S SUPPOSED
TO BE?

162
00:06:17,544 --> 00:06:18,712
HE'S STAYING HERE
ON SET.

163
00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:19,463
HE'S SLEEPING HERE.

164
00:06:19,546 --> 00:06:21,673
HE TOLD ME
YOU KNEW THAT.

165
00:06:21,757 --> 00:06:23,300
I KNEW THAT.

166
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:25,052
SPINNER,
THE ONLY THING I KNOW,

167
00:06:25,135 --> 00:06:26,053
IS THAT MAKING
A MOVIE

168
00:06:26,136 --> 00:06:27,387
WITH A BUNCH
OF HIGH SCHOOL KIDS -

169
00:06:27,471 --> 00:06:29,890
WAY WORSE THAN MAKING
A MOVIE WITH BEN AFFLECK.

170
00:06:29,973 --> 00:06:30,849
WAY WORSE.

171
00:06:30,933 --> 00:06:32,100
I'LL HAVE
ONE OF THESE.

172
00:06:32,935 --> 00:06:33,977
(DIALS PHONE)

173
00:06:35,479 --> 00:06:36,855
(DOOR CLICKS OPEN)

174
00:06:36,939 --> 00:06:37,731
OH, KEVIN.

175
00:06:37,814 --> 00:06:38,732
GREAT, GREAT, GREAT!
COME IN.

176
00:06:38,815 --> 00:06:39,900
I'M STILL WORKING
ON THE LYRICS,

177
00:06:39,983 --> 00:06:42,319
BUT LET ME
JUST PLAY WHAT I-

178
00:06:48,116 --> 00:06:49,368
I THINK YOU KNOW
WHAT YOU CAN DO

DID I OR DID I NOT
TELL YOU

185
00:07:03,674 --> 00:07:04,591
THAT SENDING CRAIG
OFF TO ENGLAND

186
00:07:04,675 --> 00:07:06,260
WAS A BAD IDEA,
CAITLIN?

187
00:07:06,343 --> 00:07:08,720
WHOA.
DON'T MAKE IT MY FAULT.

188
00:07:09,638 --> 00:07:10,639
OH NO?

189
00:07:11,223 --> 00:07:13,058
IT WAS YOUR IDEA.

190
00:07:13,141 --> 00:07:14,977
YOU SUPPORTED IT.

191
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:16,395
NOW HE AND ASHLEY
BROKE UP

192
00:07:16,478 --> 00:07:17,187
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?

193
00:07:17,271 --> 00:07:18,981
HE'S BEEN LIVING
IN THE DEGRASSI BOILER ROOM.

194
00:07:20,482 --> 00:07:21,233
ANGELA:
OKAY.

195
00:07:21,316 --> 00:07:23,026
WE'RE GOING UPSTAIRS.

196
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:29,074
CAITLIN:
AREN'T YOU AT ALL CURIOUS
AS TO WHY HE LIED;

197
00:07:29,157 --> 00:07:30,284
FELT LIKE HE COULDN'T
TRUST YOU?

198
00:07:30,367 --> 00:07:31,368
JOEY:
TRUST ME?

199
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:32,953
I'M THE ONLY ONE
HE CAN TRUST.

200
00:07:33,036 --> 00:07:34,788
JOEY, YOU FLY OFF
THE HANDLE!

201
00:07:34,872 --> 00:07:36,373
AND YOU DON'T THINK!

202
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:37,833
YOU NEVER HAVE!

203
00:07:37,916 --> 00:07:39,793
LIKE UP AND QUITTING
YOUR JOB -

204
00:07:39,877 --> 00:07:40,252
WHY?

205
00:07:40,335 --> 00:07:41,295
OH, OKAY,

206
00:07:41,378 --> 00:07:43,463
THANKS FOR MIXING UP
THE FIGHT, JOEY.

207
00:07:43,547 --> 00:07:44,631
AND AS FOR CRAIG,

208
00:07:44,715 --> 00:07:46,633
KEVIN AND I SAW
WHAT YOU COULDN'T.

209
00:07:46,717 --> 00:07:47,926
HIS HEART
WAS BREAKING.

210
00:07:48,010 --> 00:07:48,969
JOEY:
WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT?

211
00:07:49,052 --> 00:07:50,762
I AM MORE CONCERNED
ABOUT HIS MIND, RIGHT NOW.

212
00:07:50,846 --> 00:07:53,098
BECAUSE IT IS A HELL
OF A LOT MORE FRAGILE.

213
00:07:53,182 --> 00:07:54,308
AND LOOK, IF YOU WANT
TO CONSIDER YOURSELF

214
00:07:54,391 --> 00:07:55,309
A PART OF THIS FAMILY-

215
00:07:55,392 --> 00:07:57,144
DO NOT PULL
THE FAMILY CARD.

216
00:07:57,227 --> 00:07:58,353
BECAUSE IF IT
WASN'T FOR ME,

217
00:07:58,437 --> 00:08:00,814
YOU WOULDN'T EVEN HAVE A ROOF
OVER YOUR HEAD, REMEMBER?

218
00:08:18,207 --> 00:08:19,458
YOU WERE RIGHT.

219
00:08:19,958 --> 00:08:21,793
YOU'RE THE ONLY PERSON
I WANT TO TALK TO.

220
00:08:24,755 --> 00:08:25,422

I MEANT THAT
AS A DONATION,

225
00:09:03,335 --> 00:09:04,628
NOT A DUET.

226
00:09:04,711 --> 00:09:06,046
ALL RIGHT.

227
00:09:06,755 --> 00:09:07,965

(PLAYING TOGETHER)

239
00:09:47,796 --> 00:09:50,299
IS IT KEVIN NOW
OR SILENT BOB?

240
00:09:50,382 --> 00:09:53,343
WHAT BRINGS YOU BACK

YOU KNOW HOW MUCH
HIS CAR IS WORTH?

307
00:12:28,582 --> 00:12:31,376

357
00:14:33,916 --> 00:14:35,334
HERE, LISTEN.

358
00:14:35,417 --> 00:14:38,212
♪ THERE'LL NEVER BE
A SINGLE PLACE ♪

359
00:14:38,295 --> 00:14:39,588
♪ WHERE I FEEL SAFE ♪

360
00:14:39,671 --> 00:14:41,924
♪ WHERE I CAN ESCAPE
FROM YOU ♪

361
00:14:42,883 --> 00:14:44,218
JOEY:
IF ANYONE KNOWS HIM,

362
00:14:44,301 --> 00:14:46,970
PLEASE CALL
1-555-MISSING.

363
00:14:47,679 --> 00:14:48,597
KEVIN:
SO, THANKS FOR
DROPPING ME OFF.

364
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:50,098
THAT WAS REALLY COOL
OF YOU.

365
00:14:50,182 --> 00:14:51,183
SURE YOU DON'T WANT
TO HANG OUT TONIGHT?

366
00:14:51,266 --> 00:14:53,560
WE'RE SHOOTING
THE BIG FOOTBALL GAME SCENE

367
00:14:53,644 --> 00:14:55,103
WHERE JAY SAVES
APOLLONIA

368
00:14:55,187 --> 00:14:58,023
FROM THE SOUL-SUCKING
CHEERLEADERS OF KINGSBERG.

369
00:14:58,106 --> 00:14:58,982
I SHOULD REALLY
BE THERE

370
00:14:59,066 --> 00:15:02,152
FOR WHEN JOEY
BRINGS CRAIG BACK.

371
00:15:02,236 --> 00:15:03,612
YEAH.
JOEY.

372
00:15:08,325 --> 00:15:09,660
THANK YOU.

373
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:12,037
FOR WHAT?

374
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,539
EVERYTHING.

375
00:15:17,584 --> 00:15:17,793
I'M SORRY,

376
00:15:17,876 --> 00:15:19,002
I HAVE TO TRY
THIS AGAIN.

377
00:15:19,086 --> 00:15:19,920
JT:
MR. SMITH?

378
00:15:20,003 --> 00:15:21,505
JAMES TIBERIUS.

379
00:15:21,588 --> 00:15:23,715
THE TESTY FIRST A.D.
WANTS YOU ON SET.

380
00:15:23,799 --> 00:15:25,300
AS IN IMMEDIATELY.

381
00:15:25,384 --> 00:15:27,135
TELL HIM I'LL BE THERE
IN A COUPLE.

382
00:15:27,219 --> 00:15:27,719
GO.

383
00:15:27,803 --> 00:15:30,806
THE ADULTS
ARE TALKING NOW.

384
00:15:30,889 --> 00:15:32,766
THAT A.D.'S KIND
OF A MANEATER

385
00:15:32,850 --> 00:15:35,185
SO I'M GONNA HEAD OFF.

386
00:15:39,439 --> 00:15:42,651
HEY, JUST DON'T SETTLE,
ALL RIGHT?

387
00:15:42,734 --> 00:15:43,694
YOU KNOW,

388
00:15:43,777 --> 00:15:47,489
FOR SOMEBODY ELSE'S IDEA
OF WHAT THE "REAL WORLD" IS.

389
00:15:47,573 --> 00:15:49,616
YOU'RE JUST FAR TOO COOL
A CHICK FOR THAT.

390
00:15:51,285 --> 00:15:52,661
PICK YOUR OWN
REAL WORLD.

391
00:15:53,954 --> 00:15:56,290
YOU DESERVE THAT MUCH.

392
00:15:58,792 --> 00:15:59,626
THANK YOU.

393
00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:12,890
GUITAR.
MY GUITAR.

394
00:16:12,973 --> 00:16:14,183
HE TOOK MY GUITAR.

395
00:16:14,266 --> 00:16:15,225
WHEN I SAID-

396
00:16:15,309 --> 00:16:16,602
WHEN HE KNEW
THAT IT WAS MINE.

397
00:16:16,685 --> 00:16:17,728
JOEY. JOEY.

398
00:16:17,811 --> 00:16:18,937
JOEY CAN HELP ME
GET MY GUITAR BACK.

399
00:16:19,021 --> 00:16:20,272
CAN'T YOU, JOEY?

400
00:16:20,355 --> 00:16:21,064
LISTEN,
HE STOLE IT.

401
00:16:21,148 --> 00:16:21,982
MY FRIEND.

402
00:16:22,065 --> 00:16:23,525
NOT MY FRIEND!

403
00:16:23,609 --> 00:16:25,152
DOES CAITLIN
HATE ME?

404
00:16:25,235 --> 00:16:26,570
WHY WOULD CAITLIN
HATE YOU?

405
00:16:26,653 --> 00:16:28,488
BECAUSE I MAKE YOU FIGHT,

406
00:16:28,572 --> 00:16:29,865
AND I RUN AWAY.

407
00:16:29,948 --> 00:16:31,950
AND I,
I ALWAYS HURT YOU

408
00:16:32,034 --> 00:16:32,993
LIKE MY DAD HURT ME.

409
00:16:33,076 --> 00:16:34,494
YOU KNOW MY DAD
USED TO HIT ME?

410
00:16:34,578 --> 00:16:35,621
OH, BUT YOU JUST THINK
I'M CRAZY.

411
00:16:35,704 --> 00:16:37,080
EVERYONE JUST THINKS
I'M CRAZY.

412
00:16:37,164 --> 00:16:38,040
I DON'T THINK
YOU'RE CRAZY,

413
00:16:38,123 --> 00:16:38,957
YOU'RE ILL.
OKAY, CRAIG?

414
00:16:39,041 --> 00:16:40,501
IT'S THE BI-POLAR
ACTING UP.

415
00:16:40,584 --> 00:16:42,836
YOU BLAME EVERYTHING
ON ME BEING CRAZY.

416
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:45,088
I WON'T.
I WON'T.

417
00:16:45,172 --> 00:16:47,174
I PROMISE YOU
NEVER AGAIN, OKAY?

418
00:16:47,257 --> 00:16:48,300
I JUST-
CAN WE GET YOU HOME?

419
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:50,052
CRAIG, PLEASE.

420
00:16:50,844 --> 00:16:52,679
JOEY, MY GUITAR.

421
00:16:56,225 --> 00:16:59,186
WHAT DID I DO
WITH MY GUITAR?

422
00:17:00,521 --> 00:17:03,440
JUST HELP ME FIND IT,
PLEASE?

423
00:17:13,492 --> 00:17:14,993
JOEY:
HE'S ASLEEP.

424
00:17:16,954 --> 00:17:18,580
I GOT HIM TO AGREE TO GO
TO THE POLICE FIRST THING,

425
00:17:18,664 --> 00:17:20,791
AND GIVE A DESCRIPTION
OF THIS "SKINNY".

426
00:17:20,874 --> 00:17:22,292
WHO CALLS THEMSELVES
THAT ANYWAYS?

427
00:17:23,043 --> 00:17:25,170
WHO CALLS THEMSELVES
SNAKE OR WHEELS?

428
00:17:26,255 --> 00:17:26,922
I JUST HOPE
THIS GUY'S NECK

429
00:17:27,005 --> 00:17:28,298
IS SKINNY ENOUGH
FOR ME TO BREAK.

430
00:17:28,882 --> 00:17:30,008
HE MIGHT BE MENTALLY ILL TOO,
JOEY.

431
00:17:30,092 --> 00:17:31,260
REMEMBER THAT.

432
00:17:31,844 --> 00:17:33,303
MAYBE HE'S ANOTHER
LOST CRAIG.

433
00:17:33,887 --> 00:17:34,888
OH, COME ON.

434
00:17:35,681 --> 00:17:36,807
YOU DON'T SEE CRAIG
BEATING UP STRANGERS

435
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:38,100
IN THE STREET,
DO YOU?

436
00:17:38,183 --> 00:17:40,060
NO, HE JUST BEATS YOU UP
AT HOME.

437
00:17:41,228 --> 00:17:42,729
JUST... FORGET IT.

438
00:17:49,403 --> 00:17:51,488
WHAT ARE WE DOING,
JOEY?

439
00:17:52,447 --> 00:17:54,992
FIGHTING.
LIKE USUAL.

440
00:17:55,075 --> 00:17:57,578
ALL WE EVER DO
IS FIGHT.

441
00:17:58,453 --> 00:18:02,291
I MEAN, CRAIG'S UPSTAIRS
SAFE AND SOUND.

442
00:18:04,001 --> 00:18:06,420
HOW CAN WE GET
MARRIED?

443
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:07,963
REALLY.

444
00:18:10,591 --> 00:18:12,885
I MEAN,
I LOVE YOU...

445
00:18:12,968 --> 00:18:15,637
AND CRAIG,
AND ANGELA, SO MUCH.

446
00:18:15,721 --> 00:18:18,056
BUT THIS,
IT'S JUST...

447
00:18:19,766 --> 00:18:21,018
IT'S NOT
WHAT IT SHOULD BE.

448
00:18:28,734 --> 00:18:32,112
SO ARE YOU GONNA TAKE
THAT JOB OFFER...

449
00:18:32,196 --> 00:18:33,363
IN L.A.?

450
00:18:33,864 --> 00:18:36,200
I'M THINKING ABOUT IT.
YEAH.

451
00:18:44,041 --> 00:18:45,501
JAY:
YO, EDMUND FITZGERALD
SECONDARY,

452
00:18:45,584 --> 00:18:47,794

00:19:06,522 --> 00:19:07,481
THAT IS JUST-
OOF!

462
00:19:08,690 --> 00:19:11,068
KEVIN:
YOU MADE ME AND MY FALLEN
HETERO LIFEMATE

463
00:19:11,151 --> 00:19:12,819
FEEL LIKE A BIG PART

464
00:19:13,362 --> 00:19:15,447
OF YOUR HOME
AND NATIVE LAND.

465
00:19:15,531 --> 00:19:16,782
AND, SERIOUSLY,

466
00:19:18,575 --> 00:19:22,412
MADE THIS THE BEST BLEEPING
YEAR OF OUR LIVES!

467
00:19:23,497 --> 00:19:23,830
WOO!

468
00:19:25,541 --> 00:19:27,543
("POMP AND CIRCUMSTANCE" PLAYS)

469
00:19:32,631 --> 00:19:32,965
CUT!

470
00:19:34,299 --> 00:19:35,551
DEGRASSI,
THAT'S A WRAP!

471
00:19:35,884 --> 00:19:37,386
(CHEERING)

472
00:19:45,394 --> 00:19:46,228
KEVIN:
THANK YOU FOR ALL YOUR HELP.

473
00:19:46,311 --> 00:19:46,645
YOU?

474
00:19:47,688 --> 00:19:49,857
YOU WERE HEAVEN
ON EARTH, LOVE.

475
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:51,358
NOW GET OUT OF MY WAY.

476
00:19:51,441 --> 00:19:54,027
SIR, WHY DO YOU ALWAYS HAVE
TO GET THE LAST LINE IN?

477
00:19:54,111 --> 00:19:55,237
WHY DOES IT BOTHER
YOU SO MUCH

478
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:56,154
IS MY QUESTION?

479
00:19:56,238 --> 00:19:57,322
'CAUSE YOU'RE ALWAYS
TRYING TO UPSTAGE ME.

480
00:19:57,406 --> 00:19:58,949
"OH, LOOK AT ME,
I'M SILENT BOB!"

481
00:19:59,032 --> 00:19:59,825
OH, LOOK AT THIS.

482
00:19:59,908 --> 00:20:02,619
DUDE!
I TOOK THE CUP OFF.

483
00:20:02,703 --> 00:20:04,538
AND I KNEW THAT.

484
00:20:05,622 --> 00:20:06,456
MR. MANNING!

485
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:07,583
KEVIN.

486
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:09,126
(WHISTLING)

487
00:20:09,209 --> 00:20:11,211
KEVIN:
WELL REMEMBERED, SIR.

488
00:20:11,295 --> 00:20:12,337
OH, HELLO.

489
00:20:12,421 --> 00:20:13,505
CONGRATULATIONS.

490
00:20:13,589 --> 00:20:15,132
THANK YOU,
MS. RYAN.

491
00:20:15,215 --> 00:20:16,758
AND NOW
CONGRATULATE ME.

492
00:20:16,842 --> 00:20:18,677
WHY WOULD I BE
DOING THAT EXACTLY?

493
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:20,596
CAUSE I SAID YES
TO THE L.A. OFFER.

494
00:20:20,679 --> 00:20:21,430
NO.

495
00:20:22,472 --> 00:20:24,766
RYAN'S PLANET
WILL SPIN ONCE AGAIN

496
00:20:24,850 --> 00:20:25,976
BECAUSE OF YOU.

497
00:20:26,059 --> 00:20:27,394
COME HERE.

498
00:20:39,364 --> 00:20:41,116
JOEY.
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

499
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:42,534
THE PARTY'S JUST
GETTING STARTED.

500
00:20:42,618 --> 00:20:43,035
HOME.

501
00:20:44,203 --> 00:20:45,829
SORRY,
CAITLIN'S HOME.

502
00:20:45,913 --> 00:20:46,622
CRAIG:
WE'RE SUPPOSED TO TALK,
REMEMBER?

503
00:20:46,705 --> 00:20:48,624
IT GOES BOTH WAYS.

504
00:20:52,961 --> 00:20:54,338
(SOBS)

505
00:20:57,216 --> 00:20:59,635
I DON'T WANT HER
TO GO.

506
00:21:00,552 --> 00:21:02,304
I KNOW.
I KNOW.

507
00:21:03,764 --> 00:21:05,265
BUT I'M HERE

508
00:21:05,891 --> 00:21:06,808
AND ANGIE'S HERE.

509
00:21:07,684 --> 00:21:08,977
AND WE'RE NOT
GOING ANYWHERE.

510
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:13,899
I'M NOT GOING
ANYWHERE.

511
00:21:19,404 --> 00:21:20,322
OKAY.

512
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:26,078
KEVIN:
FOLKS, I WOULD LIKE TO RAISE
A VERY SIMPLE TOAST...

513
00:21:26,161 --> 00:21:27,162
TO DEGRASSI!
