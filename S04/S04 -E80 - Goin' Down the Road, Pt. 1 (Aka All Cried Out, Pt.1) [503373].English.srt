ONLY TRYING TO GET
MORRISSEY HERE

178
00:05:52,936 --> 00:05:54,188

180
00:05:55,606 --> 00:05:57,274
ASH'S LEAVING

WHERE SHE'S GONNA FIND
SOME WAY COOLER GUY

182

00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,612
FALL MADLY IN LOVE.

AND NEVER,
EVER COME BACK.

185
00:06:03,864 --> 00:06:04,948
UGH! THE ANGST.

186
00:06:04,948 --> 00:06:07,284
THANK GOD I'M NOT
A TEENAGER ANYMORE.

187
00:06:07,284 --> 00:06:08,118
IT'S NOT FUNNY.

188
00:06:08,118 --> 00:06:08,493
JASON:
IT'S RIGHT.

189
00:06:08,493 --> 00:06:10,329
IT'S "PATHETIC."

190
00:06:13,999 --> 00:06:14,833
SIR...

THE TEENAGE GIRL

ME GOING TO ENGLAND'S
THE WORST IDEA SINCE...

219

220
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:13,809
I THINK A SUMMER AWAY

221
00:07:13,809 --> 00:07:15,394
WOULD BE GREAT
FOR YOU, ACTUALLY.

222

YOU'VE GOT SOMETHING
MORE HOLLYWOOD, RIGHT?

MORE, MORE DISHY?

230
00:07:41,879 --> 00:07:44,548
KEVIN IS NOT
EXACTLY "DISHY."

231
00:07:44,548 --> 00:07:47,885
I MEAN, HE'S MORE
"SELF-DEPRECATING,"

232
00:07:47,885 --> 00:07:48,468
"FUNNY".

233
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:50,387
FUNNY'S GOOD.

234
00:07:50,387 --> 00:07:51,138
ESPECIALLY WHEN
IT'S COMING

235
00:07:51,138 --> 00:07:53,307

OPPORTUNITY, OKAY?

A LOWER LEVEL...

239
00:07:57,853 --> 00:07:58,729
THAT'S RIGHT.

240
00:07:58,729 --> 00:08:01,857

IT'S AROUND THE
THREE MINUTE MARK.

243
00:08:08,864 --> 00:08:09,907
IF YOU LOOK AT IT,

244
00:08:09,907 --> 00:08:12,868
MORE DEMOCRATS WENT
TO SEE SHREK 2 LAST YEAR,

245
00:08:12,868 --> 00:08:14,369
THAN VOTED
IN THE ELECTION

246
00:08:14,369 --> 00:08:16,663
SO, WHAT'S THERE
TO GET EXCITED ABOUT?

247
00:08:16,663 --> 00:08:17,664

284
00:10:04,354 --> 00:10:07,357
OKAY, THERE'S THIS
A GREAT MUSIC SCHOOL...

I'D BE EARNING
A CREDIT FOR NEXT YEAR.

288

YOU WANT TO GO
TO ENGLAND?

289
00:10:11,737 --> 00:10:13,238
IT'S JUST FOR
THE SUMMER.

EVEN I WON'T
PUT MY MOUTH.

321
00:11:16,468 --> 00:11:18,554

00:12:15,652 --> 00:12:17,571
NO NEED TO THANK ME.

354
00:12:17,571 --> 00:12:19,948
WELL, I DO.
BECAUSE UM...

355
00:12:19,948 --> 00:12:21,283
I SAID NO.

356
00:12:22,451 --> 00:12:24,870
UM, NO? WAIT. NO.

357
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:25,621
YOU DIDN'T.

358
00:12:25,621 --> 00:12:27,122
YOU CAN'T SAY NO.

359
00:12:27,122 --> 00:12:29,291
I HAVE MY FAMILY,
I HAVE MY OWN SHOW.

360
00:12:29,291 --> 00:12:32,252
I MEAN I CAN'T
JUST TAKE OFF TO LA?

361
00:12:32,252 --> 00:12:33,295
NOT FOR NOTHING,

362
00:12:33,295 --> 00:12:36,131
BUT YOU GOT TO GO BACK
TO ACTING GLOBALLY,

363
00:12:36,131 --> 00:12:37,257
NEVER MIND ALL THIS
LOCAL STUFF.

364
00:12:37,257 --> 00:12:38,133
AND IT'S JUST
HEARTBREAKING

365
00:12:38,133 --> 00:12:39,426
TO SEE YOU
SITTING AROUND

366
00:12:39,426 --> 00:12:41,136
COBBLING TOGETHER
PUFF PIECES

367
00:12:41,136 --> 00:12:42,971
ABOUT VISITING
D-GRADE CELEBRITIES.

368
00:12:42,971 --> 00:12:44,890
IT'S BENEATH YOU.

369
00:12:45,724 --> 00:12:47,309
D-GRADE CELEBRITIES?

370
00:12:47,309 --> 00:12:47,935
YEAH.

371
00:12:47,935 --> 00:12:49,186
LIKE YOU?

372
00:12:51,939 --> 00:12:52,856
WAIT...

373
00:12:54,274 --> 00:12:57,402
I'M AT LEAST A C-GRADE
CELEBRITY, THOUGH.

374
00:12:57,402 --> 00:12:58,862
I, I HAVE
NO PROCESS.

375
00:12:58,862 --> 00:13:00,489
I DON'T CONSIDER
MYSELF A,

376
00:13:00,489 --> 00:13:02,115
A FILM MAKER,
REALLY.

377
00:13:02,115 --> 00:13:03,534
I'M JUST A GUY WHO GETS
TO DIRECT THE STUFF

378
00:13:03,534 --> 00:13:04,701
THAT HE WRITES. AND -

379
00:13:04,701 --> 00:13:05,536
SORRY, CAITLIN,

380
00:13:05,536 --> 00:13:06,036
BUT I'M LOCKING
YOU OUT

381
00:13:06,036 --> 00:13:07,287
OF THE EDIT SUITE
ON THIS ONE.

382
00:13:07,287 --> 00:13:08,330
WHAT?!

383
00:13:08,330 --> 00:13:09,998
WHAT, YOU'RE TAKING
THE KEVIN SMITH SPOT

384
00:13:09,998 --> 00:13:10,874
AWAY FROM ME?

385
00:13:10,874 --> 00:13:13,377
YEAH. I WANT CELEBRITY
GOSSIP, ALL RIGHT?

386
00:13:13,377 --> 00:13:14,878
EVEN NON-CELEBRITY
GOSSIP.

387
00:13:14,878 --> 00:13:17,214
HELL, IF THIS GUY
SPENT THE WHOLE SEGMENT

388
00:13:17,214 --> 00:13:18,549
TALKING ABOUT
HIS GAY DOG,

389
00:13:18,549 --> 00:13:22,135
IT'D BE MORE
ENJOYABLE THAN THIS.

390
00:13:22,135 --> 00:13:23,971
I, I TRY NOT
TO OVER THINK IT.

391
00:13:23,971 --> 00:13:24,346
IT'S JUST A
COMMUNICATION-

392
00:13:24,346 --> 00:13:26,515
WELL, IT'S HIS PROCESS
AS A FILM-MAKER.

393
00:13:26,515 --> 00:13:28,433
YEAH, AND I'M NOT
LAUGHING, ALL RIGHT?

394
00:13:28,433 --> 00:13:31,186
I'M NOT HEARING
ANYTHING ABOUT BENNIFER.

395
00:13:31,186 --> 00:13:33,021
EVERY TIME I HAND
SOMETHING IN TO YOU,

396
00:13:33,021 --> 00:13:34,606
YOU RIP IT APART
OR YOU CHANGE IT.

397
00:13:34,606 --> 00:13:35,858
WHY?

398
00:13:35,858 --> 00:13:37,943
WHY? YOU TELL
ME, CAITLIN.

399
00:13:37,943 --> 00:13:39,611
THIS ISN'T
"RYAN'S WORLD".

400
00:13:39,611 --> 00:13:40,904
"RYAN'S PLANET."

401
00:13:40,904 --> 00:13:42,197
OR THAT.

402
00:13:42,197 --> 00:13:44,366
IT'S "LOCAL HEROES".

403
00:13:46,201 --> 00:13:47,244
I QUIT.

404
00:13:49,705 --> 00:13:51,039
(PLAYING GUITAR)

405
00:13:54,126 --> 00:13:55,502
YEAH, SO,
IT STILL NEEDS LYRICS.

406
00:13:55,502 --> 00:13:56,670
BUT WHAT
DO YOU THINK?

407
00:13:56,670 --> 00:13:58,255
IT'S GOOD.
IT'S GOOD.

408
00:13:58,255 --> 00:13:59,882
I GOT SOMETHING FOR YOU:

409
00:13:59,882 --> 00:14:03,635
ASHLEY PLEASE DON'T GO,
PLEASE DON'T LEAVE ME,

410
00:14:03,635 --> 00:14:05,053
DON'T FALL IN LOVE

411
00:14:05,053 --> 00:14:06,513
WITH AN UGLY LIMEY...

412
00:14:06,513 --> 00:14:08,098
SHUT UP.

413
00:14:08,098 --> 00:14:09,933
OKAY, YOU CAN'T -

414
00:14:09,933 --> 00:14:10,684
YOU CAN'T
THROW FRIES

415
00:14:10,684 --> 00:14:13,353
AT A KID IN
A WHEEL CHAIR.

416
00:14:15,105 --> 00:14:16,106
CRAIG.

417
00:14:17,357 --> 00:14:18,567
LET'S GO GET
OUR SEATS.

418
00:14:18,567 --> 00:14:20,402
JOEY:
CRAIG, LISTEN.

419
00:14:20,402 --> 00:14:21,612
I KNOW YOU THOUGHT
I WAS BEING OFFENSIVE,

420
00:14:21,612 --> 00:14:22,196
BUT HONESTLY,

421
00:14:22,196 --> 00:14:24,114
I WASN'T TRYING
TO HURT YOU.

422
00:14:24,114 --> 00:14:26,116
YEAH, WELL?
YOU DID.

423
00:14:26,116 --> 00:14:27,451
I MEAN, WHY DO I TAKE
THE STUPID PILLS?

424
00:14:27,451 --> 00:14:30,412
YOU DON'T BELIEVE
I'M BETTER.

425
00:14:33,123 --> 00:14:36,126
THERE ARE
CONDITIONS, THOUGH.

426
00:14:36,126 --> 00:14:36,251
I'M GOING TO BE CALLING
THE SCHOOL

427
00:14:36,251 --> 00:14:38,295
TO DISCLOSE YOUR ILLNESS.

428
00:14:38,295 --> 00:14:39,671
I WANT YOU TO CALL ME,
EVERY DAY -

429
00:14:39,671 --> 00:14:41,590
ESPECIALLY IF SOMETHING
DOESN'T FEEL RIGHT.

430
00:14:41,590 --> 00:14:44,051
AND I WANT MR. KERWIN
TO KEEP AN EYE ON YOU TOO.

431
00:14:44,051 --> 00:14:46,595
YEAH. EVERYTHING.
ANYTHING.

432
00:14:46,595 --> 00:14:49,681
I CAN HANDLE IT.
I CAN. REALLY.

433
00:14:55,604 --> 00:14:57,022
CRAIG:
HEY!

434
00:14:58,524 --> 00:14:59,191
(GRUNTS)

435
00:14:59,191 --> 00:15:00,484
WHAT D'YOU
GOT IN HERE?

436
00:15:00,484 --> 00:15:02,819
EVERY SHOE I OWN.
HEY.

437
00:15:07,282 --> 00:15:08,283
YOU KNOW, I THOUGHT
THIS WHOLE GOODBYE THING

438
00:15:08,283 --> 00:15:09,326
WAS GOING TO BE
SO HARD.

439
00:15:09,326 --> 00:15:11,954
BUT I'M, I'M
SO GLAD YOU'RE HERE,

440
00:15:11,954 --> 00:15:13,247
THAT YOU SURPRISED ME.

441
00:15:13,247 --> 00:15:16,291
PARTING IS SO NOT
SWEET SORROW.

442
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:20,879
I'M AH, I'M COMING.
TOMORROW.

443
00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:22,714
BUT SINCE IT'S
A RED-EYE,

444
00:15:22,714 --> 00:15:25,676
I'LL BE IN LONDON
THE DAY AFTER THAT.

445
00:15:25,676 --> 00:15:27,636
YOU'RE JUST
FLYING TO LONDON?

446
00:15:27,636 --> 00:15:29,388
THAT'S WHAT
PLANES ARE FOR.

447
00:15:29,388 --> 00:15:32,975
YOU - YOU CAN'T FOLLOW
ME TO ENGLAND.

448
00:15:33,892 --> 00:15:35,477
ASH, C'MON.

449
00:15:35,477 --> 00:15:37,396
LOOK...WHY,
WHY ARE YOU HERE?

450
00:15:37,396 --> 00:15:39,231
DOING THIS?

451
00:15:39,231 --> 00:15:40,649
ARE YOU OFF
YOUR MEDS?

452
00:15:40,649 --> 00:15:42,818
NO! I'M NOT
OFF MY MEDS.

453
00:15:42,818 --> 00:15:44,069
I'M HERE 'CAUSE
I LOVE YOU

454
00:15:44,069 --> 00:15:44,945
AND I HAVE PLANS.

455
00:15:44,945 --> 00:15:45,946
YEAH.
SO DO I, CRAIG.

456
00:15:45,946 --> 00:15:47,531
AND YOU SAID YOU WERE
OKAY WITH THEM.

457
00:15:47,531 --> 00:15:49,992
YOU SAID IT REPEATEDLY -
SO WHAT IS THIS?

458
00:15:49,992 --> 00:15:51,118
THIS IS ME TRYING
TO FIGURE OUT

459
00:15:51,118 --> 00:15:52,703
HOW WE'RE GONNA SPEND
THE SUMMER TOGETHER.

460
00:15:52,703 --> 00:15:54,496
YOU THINK I'M HAVING
AN EPISODE!

461
00:15:54,496 --> 00:15:56,999
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO THINK.

462
00:15:56,999 --> 00:15:58,667
LOOK, I NEED SPACE.

463
00:15:58,667 --> 00:16:00,043
I NEED TO GET AWAY.

464
00:16:00,043 --> 00:16:01,336
OH, OKAY.

465
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:04,673
FROM YOU.

466
00:16:05,382 --> 00:16:08,010
LOOK, CRAIG.
I LOVE YOU.

467
00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:09,511
BUT EVER SINCE
MY DAD'S WEDDING

468
00:16:09,511 --> 00:16:11,096
IT'S JUST BEEN ME,
WORRYING.

469
00:16:11,096 --> 00:16:12,556
I MEAN, WATCHING
FOR SIGNS,

470
00:16:12,556 --> 00:16:14,349
WATCHING WHAT I SAY.

471
00:16:14,349 --> 00:16:15,100
WHY WON'T YOU
JUST BELIEVE ME?

472
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:16,810
I'M BETTER NOW.

473
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:18,520
I'M OKAY. I AM.

474
00:16:22,024 --> 00:16:23,734
EMAIL ME, OKAY?

475
00:16:24,651 --> 00:16:27,321
I'LL SEE YOU
IN SEPTEMBER.

476
00:16:29,364 --> 00:16:30,032
(CRYING)

477
00:16:42,544 --> 00:16:44,546
CAITLIN:
HE SAYS,
"IT'S "LOCAL HEROES."

478
00:16:44,546 --> 00:16:47,633
LIKE, LIKE IT'S
ACTUALLY A GOOD TITLE.

479
00:16:47,633 --> 00:16:48,634
IT IS THE SINGLE
WORST TITLE

480
00:16:48,634 --> 00:16:50,385
SINCE "HOPE FLOATS".

481
00:16:50,385 --> 00:16:50,886
THANK YOU.

482
00:16:50,886 --> 00:16:51,220
YES.

483
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:54,890
YEAH. 'CAUSE YOU
THINK HE'D WANT ME

484
00:16:54,890 --> 00:16:56,975
TO ADD SOME SUBSTANCE
TO HIS CRAPPY,

485
00:16:56,975 --> 00:16:59,853
UNORIGINAL IDEA
OF A SHOW.

486
00:16:59,853 --> 00:17:00,938
IF HE WAS HERE,
RIGHT NOW?

487
00:17:00,938 --> 00:17:02,356
I WOULD THROW
THIS DRINK -

488
00:17:02,356 --> 00:17:03,732
WITH THE ICE CUBES
IN HIS FACE.

489
00:17:03,732 --> 00:17:05,359
LISTEN TO YOU, BABE.
RIGHT ON.

490
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:08,028
THIS IS THE CAITLIN RYAN
I REMEMBER.

491
00:17:08,028 --> 00:17:09,821
THE CAITLIN RYAN
FROM THE DVDS,

492
00:17:09,821 --> 00:17:10,739
"RYAN'S PLANET".

493
00:17:10,739 --> 00:17:11,782
ADVOCATE
CAITLIN RYAN.

494
00:17:11,782 --> 00:17:12,908
NO, THIS IS
THE CAITLIN

495
00:17:12,908 --> 00:17:14,993
THAT PRODUCES FLUFF

496
00:17:16,078 --> 00:17:16,995
LIKE CAMPING TRIPS

497
00:17:16,995 --> 00:17:19,998
AND HIGH SCHOOL BLOOD
DRIVES AND -

498
00:17:19,998 --> 00:17:21,333
AND I NEED
ANOTHER DRINK.

499
00:17:21,333 --> 00:17:23,418
NO, HON. YOU DON'T
NEED ANOTHER DRINK.

500
00:17:23,418 --> 00:17:24,837
YOU KNOW, I NEED
ABOUT TEN DRINKS

501
00:17:24,837 --> 00:17:26,255
TO GET TO
WHATEVER PLANE

502
00:17:26,255 --> 00:17:27,422
YOU'RE ON, RIGHT NOW.

503
00:17:27,422 --> 00:17:28,507
UH-HUH.

504
00:17:29,216 --> 00:17:32,719
SO, WHO'S ON KEVIN'S
"PLANE" ANYWAY?

505
00:17:33,929 --> 00:17:36,139
IS THAT YOUR VERY
DRUNK CHARMING WAY

506
00:17:36,139 --> 00:17:38,767
OF ASKING ME IF I'M INVOLVED
WITH ANYONE, MS. RYAN?

507
00:17:38,767 --> 00:17:39,268
'CAUSE -

508
00:17:39,268 --> 00:17:40,143
(GIGGLES) NO.

509
00:17:40,143 --> 00:17:41,353
NO?

510
00:17:41,353 --> 00:17:43,772
I'M JUST, ACTUALLY,
ASKING IF YOU'RE GAY.

511
00:17:43,772 --> 00:17:45,274
GAY?! WHAT?

512
00:17:45,274 --> 00:17:47,150
NO, I'M NOT GAY.

513
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:48,694
IS THAT WHAT
YOU THINK?

514
00:17:48,694 --> 00:17:50,279
HEAVENS, NO.

515
00:17:50,279 --> 00:17:52,155
WHY? DO I COME
OFF AS GAY?

516
00:17:52,155 --> 00:17:53,448
'CAUSE I THOUGHT -

517
00:17:53,448 --> 00:17:54,825
A LITTLE.

518
00:17:54,825 --> 00:17:55,826
DO I REALLY?

519
00:17:56,326 --> 00:17:57,077
RIGHT ON.

520
00:17:57,703 --> 00:17:58,912
GOOD TO KNOW.

521
00:17:58,912 --> 00:18:00,706
NO, NO. I'M VERY
INTO CHICKS, ACTUALLY.

522
00:18:00,706 --> 00:18:02,207
I LIKE CHICKS
QUITE A BIT.

523
00:18:02,207 --> 00:18:03,709
SO WHY AREN'T
YOU MARRIED?

524
00:18:03,709 --> 00:18:05,460
AH, WELL...UM...

525
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:06,503
I THINK I'VE JUST
ALWAYS BEEN

526
00:18:06,503 --> 00:18:08,255
KINDA WAITING FOR
THAT ONE WOMAN

527
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:10,799
WHO I LIKE TO REFER
TO AS "THE IRIS."

528
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:14,178
OH MY GOD, YOU'RE ENGAGED
