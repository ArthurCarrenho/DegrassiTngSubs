LEAVE PAIGE ALONE.

351
00:17:43,939 --> 00:17:46,191
SHE'S SO SUFFERED ENOUGH.

352
00:17:46,275 --> 00:17:49,403
SO HOW'S THE REST OF YOUR SHIFT
GOING, MY BOOTIE-BLOSSOM?

353
00:17:49,486 --> 00:17:50,737
YOU REALLY WANNA HELP?

354
00:17:50,821 --> 00:17:52,865
GIVE THE GIRL WHO LOST
HER LICENSE A RIDE HOME.

355
00:17:55,284 --> 00:17:57,578
YOU DON'T GET OFF WORK
FOR ANOTHER TWO HOURS.

356
00:18:02,583 --> 00:18:05,419
AND THERE'S SO MUCH
TO BE JEALOUS ABOUT, SPIN.

357
00:18:05,502 --> 00:18:07,504
I MEAN YOUR CHARM,

358
00:18:08,005 --> 00:18:09,006
YOUR WAY WITH WOMEN.

359
00:18:11,049 --> 00:18:11,925
YOU'RE CRAZY, MAN.

360
00:18:12,342 --> 00:18:12,676
OOH.

361
00:18:13,594 --> 00:18:15,095
NICE COMEBACK, GENIUS.

362
00:18:17,472 --> 00:18:17,973
(SLAP)

363
00:18:18,891 --> 00:18:19,975
THAT ONE BETTER FOR YOU?

364
00:18:22,352 --> 00:18:23,979
HEY, BAG OF GROSSNESS
COMING THROUGH.

365
00:18:25,939 --> 00:18:27,900
CRAIG:
YOU KNOW, YOU WERE ALWAYS
JEALOUS OF MANNY AND ME.

366
00:18:28,358 --> 00:18:30,360
YEAH? WELL NOW YOU'RE
JEALOUS OF MANNY AND ME.

367
00:18:31,361 --> 00:18:31,486
CROWD:
LET'S GO! LET'S GO!
HERE WE GO!

368
00:18:31,570 --> 00:18:34,072
FIGHT! YEAH, YEAH, YEAH!

369
00:18:37,034 --> 00:18:38,577
PAIGE:
YOU GUYS, STOP IT!

370
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:40,621
GET OFF OF EACH OTHER!
I WORK HERE!

371
00:18:40,704 --> 00:18:40,954
GO!

372
00:18:41,955 --> 00:18:43,040
I'VE CALLED SECURITY!

373
00:18:45,959 --> 00:18:47,920
ARE YOU GONNA WAIT FOR THEM
TO ARRIVE OR...

374
00:18:52,049 --> 00:18:53,008
I TOLD THEM TO LEAVE.

375
00:18:53,091 --> 00:18:54,593
HAND IN YOUR UNIFORM.

376
00:18:54,676 --> 00:18:55,969
NO, MEERI.

377
00:18:56,053 --> 00:18:57,679
YOU'RE FIRED.

378
00:18:58,347 --> 00:18:59,598
(DEJECTED SIGH)

379
00:19:03,769 --> 00:19:07,564
SO THAT'S MY 11 KISSES
TO YOUR ONE?

380
00:19:07,648 --> 00:19:09,066
YOU KNOW,
I ATTRIBUTE MY SUCCESS

381
00:19:09,149 --> 00:19:10,526
TO MY SILKY CHEEK.

382
00:19:10,609 --> 00:19:13,737
YOU ARE THE VICTOR.
I ACCEPT THAT.

383
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:15,113
BUT NONE OF YOUR KISSES
WERE EVEN CLOSE

384
00:19:15,197 --> 00:19:16,573
TO THE ONE I GOT.

385
00:19:16,657 --> 00:19:18,075
AND YOU STILL WON'T
TELL ME WHO.

386
00:19:18,158 --> 00:19:18,909
AH LET'S JUST SAY
IN THIS CASE

387
00:19:18,992 --> 00:19:22,246
IT'S ABOUT QUALITY
AND NOT QUANTITY.

388
00:19:22,329 --> 00:19:24,581
THIS HAS GIVEN ME ALL
THE CONFIDENCE I NEED.

389
00:19:24,665 --> 00:19:25,832
TO WHAT?

390
00:19:28,544 --> 00:19:30,003
OH, SURVIVAL INSTINCT
HAS THE OLDEST

391
00:19:30,087 --> 00:19:31,463
AND STRONGEST MEMBER
OF THE PACK

392
00:19:31,547 --> 00:19:34,091
PROTECTING THE YOUNG
AND THE WEAK.

393
00:19:34,174 --> 00:19:37,094
I'M WEAK.
I'M PRACTICALLY FEEBLE.

394
00:19:37,177 --> 00:19:38,512
YEAH, WELL WORD'S OUT
THAT A NINER'S

395
00:19:38,595 --> 00:19:40,806
GETTING STALKED
BY A CERTAIN...

396
00:19:40,889 --> 00:19:41,765
PSYCHO.

397
00:19:41,849 --> 00:19:44,810
TOBY:
LOOK RICK'S MY FRIEND.
I WAS-

398
00:19:45,644 --> 00:19:47,229
I WAS JUST TRYING TO SAVE HIM
FROM HUMILIATION.

399
00:19:47,312 --> 00:19:48,230
JAY:
YEAH.

400
00:19:48,313 --> 00:19:49,940
TOBY:
JAY! COME ON, MAN!
LET ME OUT!

401
00:19:50,023 --> 00:19:51,608
TOO BAD HE'S NOT HERE
TO SAVE YOU NOW.

402
00:19:51,692 --> 00:19:53,610
TOBY:
COME ON, GET OUT!
COME ON!

403
00:20:01,618 --> 00:20:02,786
AND I WAS JUST THINKING,

404
00:20:02,870 --> 00:20:05,581
"GEE, I HOPE ALEX
COMES BY TO GLOAT."

405
00:20:05,664 --> 00:20:07,249
YOU HAVE A SHIFT TOMORROW.

406
00:20:07,332 --> 00:20:08,333
THE NEW SCAMPI MOVIE'S OUT

407
00:20:08,417 --> 00:20:11,879
SO WE'LL HAVE A TON
OF OVER-SUGARED TODDLERS.

408
00:20:11,962 --> 00:20:14,673
TOU'RE NOT FUNNY
AND I'M FIRED.

409
00:20:14,756 --> 00:20:16,300
IT WASN'T YOUR FAULT.

410
00:20:16,383 --> 00:20:20,053
I TALKED TO MEERI FOR YOU
SO BE THERE.

411
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:29,062
(SIGHS)

412
00:20:29,771 --> 00:20:30,063
UM...

413
00:20:31,481 --> 00:20:32,816
I'M SORRY, OKAY?

414
00:20:34,193 --> 00:20:36,737
FOR GETTING ME CANNED
ON MY VERY FIRST SHIFT?

415
00:20:37,404 --> 00:20:38,739
NO PROBLEM.

416
00:20:38,822 --> 00:20:39,823
SPINNER:
WAIT, YOU GOT FIRED?

417
00:20:40,949 --> 00:20:43,160
PAIGE:
DON'T WORRY,
YOUR PAYCHECK'S SAFE.

418
00:20:43,243 --> 00:20:44,494
SPINNER:
THAT'S NOT ALL I CARE ABOUT.

419
00:20:44,578 --> 00:20:47,372
RIGHT.
THERE'S ALWAYS MANNY.

420
00:20:48,415 --> 00:20:49,374
SO THAT'S IT, HUH?

421
00:20:49,458 --> 00:20:50,792
GOTTA MAKE ME
THE BAD GUY HERE.

422
00:20:50,876 --> 00:20:53,253
PUT ME BACK IN MY PLACE?

423
00:20:53,337 --> 00:20:56,048
IF ANYONE HAS BEEN
PUT IN HER PLACE LATELY,

424
00:20:56,089 --> 00:20:56,757
IT'S ME.

425
00:20:58,634 --> 00:21:01,512
LISTEN, I'M SORRY ABOUT
LAST NIGHT.

426
00:21:01,595 --> 00:21:02,596
SPINNER, DON'T.

427
00:21:02,679 --> 00:21:04,056
WHY ARE YOU SO HUNG UP ON THIS?

428
00:21:05,682 --> 00:21:08,936
BECAUSE LAST NIGHT
YOU WEREN'T FIGHTING OVER ME.

429
00:21:11,188 --> 00:21:12,105
LOOK...

430
00:21:12,689 --> 00:21:15,442
WE'LL FIGURE OUT SOME KIND OF
PAYMENT SCHEDULE OR SOMETHING.

431
00:21:16,318 --> 00:21:17,361
I'VE HAD ENOUGH OF THIS.

432
00:21:18,904 --> 00:21:19,404
PAIGE!

433
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:22,741
SPIN?

434
00:21:23,951 --> 00:21:25,244
I'VE HAD ENOUGH OF YOU.
