00:09:51,425 --> 00:09:52,092
SHUT UP!

188
00:09:52,676 --> 00:09:54,344

I WAS FIFTEEN!

195
00:10:10,861 --> 00:10:12,362
I DON'T RECOMMEND
YOU DO THAT AGAIN.

196
00:10:12,446 --> 00:10:14,615
I AM TRYING TO GET IN
TO THAT FRATERNITY.

197
00:10:14,698 --> 00:10:16,366

203
00:10:27,419 --> 00:10:29,421
I FIGURE I MUST'VE DONE
SOMETHING WRONG

204
00:10:29,505 --> 00:10:31,798
IF YOU KEEP
PUNISHING ME.

205
00:10:31,882 --> 00:10:33,175
YOU DIDN'T SAY
THAT IN COURT.

206
00:10:33,258 --> 00:10:34,384
WELL,

207
00:10:34,468 --> 00:10:35,511
I MUST'VE DONE
SOMETHING RIGHT TOO,

208
00:10:35,594 --> 00:10:38,180
IF YOU KEEP COMING
BACK LIKE THIS.

209
00:10:38,263 --> 00:10:40,724

294
00:16:08,886 --> 00:16:10,637
IF HE HEARD YOU TALK
LIKE THAT.

295
00:16:10,721 --> 00:16:13,056
WELL, THEN HE'D PROBABLY
MAKE ME PAY FOR IT.

296
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:14,391
BECAUSE APPARENTLY,

297
00:16:14,474 --> 00:16:16,310

345
00:18:39,912 --> 00:18:41,955
I MIGHT LOSE MY BUSINESS.

346
00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:47,044
WHAT?

347
00:18:48,086 --> 00:18:49,046
I DIDN'T WANT
TO TELL YOU.

348
00:18:49,129 --> 00:18:50,464
I-I-I DIDN'T WANT YOU
TO WORRY.

349
00:18:51,798 --> 00:18:53,342
WELL, YOU SHOULD
HAVE SAID SOMETHING.

350
00:18:54,384 --> 00:18:56,887
I'M TRYING TO BE
THE DAD HERE.

351
00:18:57,387 --> 00:18:59,097
AND INSTEAD,
LIKE AN IDIOT,

352
00:18:59,181 --> 00:19:00,891
I HIT YOU UP
FOR CASH.

353
00:19:01,892 --> 00:19:03,185
IT WAS WRONG.

354
00:19:03,268 --> 00:19:04,561
SO YOU ASKED ME
THIS STUPID

355
00:19:04,645 --> 00:19:06,271
RENT THING INSTEAD.

356
00:19:06,313 --> 00:19:07,940

I KNOW.

357
00:19:08,857 --> 00:19:11,360
BUT MY LINE OF CREDIT
IS SHOT.

358
00:19:11,443 --> 00:19:13,445
MY BILLS,
THEY'RE HUGE.

359
00:19:16,031 --> 00:19:17,241
LOOK, I'LL GIVE YOU
THE MONEY, JOEY.

360
00:19:20,077 --> 00:19:22,955
I'LL-I'LL TAKE
MY GUITAR BACK

361
00:19:23,038 --> 00:19:24,748
AND YOU CAN
HAVE IT ALL.

362
00:19:24,831 --> 00:19:25,082
NO.

363
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:27,292
I CAN'T DO THAT.

364
00:19:27,376 --> 00:19:30,546
WELL, YOU HAVE TO LET ME
DO SOMETHING.

365
00:19:32,422 --> 00:19:35,968
LOOK, I KNOW YOU WANT TO BE
A BIG ROCK STAR SOMEDAY,

366
00:19:36,051 --> 00:19:37,803
BUT IF YOU NEEDED IT,

367
00:19:38,345 --> 00:19:42,015
I'D LIKE THE DEALERSHIP
TO BE THERE FOR YOU.

368
00:19:53,151 --> 00:19:53,402
HI.

369
00:19:58,282 --> 00:19:58,866
WHAT HAPPENED?

370
00:20:00,367 --> 00:20:02,369
WELL, I LOST MY LICENCE,

371
00:20:02,911 --> 00:20:04,538
WHICH WAS EXCITING.

372
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:06,999
AND I'M PROBABLY STUCK
WITH A YEAR

373
00:20:07,082 --> 00:20:08,834
OF COMMUNITY SERVICE.

374
00:20:09,877 --> 00:20:11,461
TEACHING ANGER MANAGEMENT?

375
00:20:13,422 --> 00:20:15,757
I THINK I'D BE GOOD
AT THAT.

376
00:20:16,717 --> 00:20:18,468
I ALSO THOUGHT
I MIGHT EMBROIDER

377
00:20:18,552 --> 00:20:19,595
"ON PROBATION"

378
00:20:19,678 --> 00:20:21,138
ON ALL MY CLOTHES.

379
00:20:21,221 --> 00:20:24,474
GIVE MYSELF THAT
"BAD GIRL" EDGE.

380
00:20:26,977 --> 00:20:29,897
SO YOU CAME BY
TO MAKE JOKES?

381
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:34,234
I CAME TO SAY THAT...

382
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:40,073
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT ELSE TO SAY.

383
00:20:46,163 --> 00:20:49,374
I WISH I'D NEVER HURT
YOUR CAR...

384
00:20:50,751 --> 00:20:51,793
OR YOU.

385
00:20:55,005 --> 00:20:55,923
OKAY.

386
00:20:57,508 --> 00:21:00,928
AND I MEANT IT
WHEN I SAID I'D PAY.

387
00:21:05,432 --> 00:21:08,685
WOULD YOU LIKE TO GO OUT
WITH ME?

388
00:21:09,728 --> 00:21:10,854
TRIPLE-FEATURE
AT THE DRIVE-IN

389
00:21:10,938 --> 00:21:12,523
THIS WEEKEND.

390
00:21:14,149 --> 00:21:16,235
SOUR CANDY'S ON ME.

391
00:21:19,863 --> 00:21:21,657
IF WE CAN GET THE CAR
IN DECENT SHAPE BY THEN.

392
00:21:32,125 --> 00:21:33,293
WRENCH?
