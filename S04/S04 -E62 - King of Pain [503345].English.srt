00:00:24,983 --> 00:00:26,360
DYLAN:
IT'S NOT LIKE SHE SAW US.

00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:26,860
HEY MA.

I GET TO CHOOSE THE SHOT.

00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:44,795
NO. NO.
THERE'S JUST THREE.

10
00:00:47,547 --> 00:00:49,383
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT,
HORRIBLE?

11
00:00:49,383 --> 00:00:51,718
EVERY ONE OF THESE SAYS
PRESIDENT TO ME.

12
00:00:51,718 --> 00:00:54,012

I'LL SEE YOU AT HOME, MA.

00:00:57,391 --> 00:00:58,725
DYLAN.

15
00:00:58,725 --> 00:01:00,852
DYLAN, WAIT UP.

16
00:01:00,852 --> 00:01:01,770
DYLAN,

17
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:03,647
DYLAN:

18
00:01:03,647 --> 00:01:04,731
OH.

00:01:04,731 --> 00:01:06,692
OKAY THEN, HERE,
TAKE THIS WITH YOU.

20
00:01:06,692 --> 00:01:09,444

21
00:01:09,444 --> 00:01:10,696
THEY'RE STRAIGHT.

22
00:01:10,696 --> 00:01:11,154
OKAY.

23
00:01:11,154 --> 00:01:12,030
SO MAKE THEM
UNCOMFORTABLE.

24
00:01:12,614 --> 00:01:14,992
ACTUALLY, THEY DON'T HAVE
A PROBLEM WITH ME BEING GAY.

25
00:01:16,493 --> 00:01:18,829
I'M YOUR BOYFRIEND, MARCO.

00:02:41,203 --> 00:02:42,662
OR JOINING SECRET
SOCIETIES.

54
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:45,457
WHATEVER THEY DO

55
00:02:45,457 --> 00:02:48,168

DYLAN'S HARD TO READ,

00:02:52,381 --> 00:02:55,008
HE HAS HIS LITTLE TANTRUM,

HATE TO DEFLATE IT

68
00:03:11,858 --> 00:03:13,402

69
00:03:13,402 --> 00:03:15,070

157
00:07:06,134 --> 00:07:07,218
I DID A LOT OF THINKING.

00:07:07,969 --> 00:07:10,472
DYLAN, COME ON,
IT WAS JUST A STUPID PICTURE.

SO IF A IS EQUAL TO 26

165
00:07:28,948 --> 00:07:32,077
WHO CAN TELL ME
WHAT THE VALUE OF B IS?

166
00:07:32,077 --> 00:07:33,119

182
00:08:42,063 --> 00:08:43,314
YOU DON'T WANT TO SEE
YOUR POSTERS?

183
00:08:44,899 --> 00:08:46,568
UH, YEAH! SURE.
MY POSTERS.

184
00:08:48,319 --> 00:08:49,487
JUST A MINUTE.

185
00:08:49,487 --> 00:08:51,072
HEY, YOUR MOM AND I
ARE VERY PROUD OF YOU, HUH?

186
00:08:51,698 --> 00:08:53,366
WE'RE GOING TO COME
TO THE ASSEMBLY...

187
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:54,701
FOR YOUR VICTORY SPEECH.

188
00:08:55,744 --> 00:08:57,370
ACTUALLY, PAPA,
THERE'S COMPETITION NOW.

189
00:08:58,413 --> 00:08:59,831
THAT'S OKAY.

190
00:08:59,831 --> 00:09:02,375
THEN THIS SHOULD
HELP YOU WIN.

191
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:03,626
SEE?

192
00:09:03,626 --> 00:09:07,172
YOUR MAMA, SHE PICKED
THE PERFECT PICTURE.

193
00:09:07,172 --> 00:09:08,506
PRESIDENT.

194
00:09:09,007 --> 00:09:10,550
THAT'S YOU.

195
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:12,719
YEAH, YEAH.
IT'S ME.

196
00:09:32,697 --> 00:09:35,492
I HAVE TO WRITE
A SPEECH.

197
00:09:35,492 --> 00:09:38,495
MARCO, WHAT'S WRONG?

198
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:40,705
THE FACT THAT I'M GOING
TO HAVE TO EVENTUALLY

199
00:09:40,705 --> 00:09:42,582
DELIVER SAID SPEECH.

200
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:45,418
MARCO?

201
00:09:48,004 --> 00:09:49,923
RELATIONSHIP STUFF, MA.

202
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:54,385
I MET THIS PERSON
LAST YEAR AND...

203
00:09:55,303 --> 00:09:56,054
WELL, WE...

204
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:58,765
LOOK, PEOPLE BREAK UP.

205
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:00,975
I'LL BE FINE.
IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL.

206
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:03,770
I DIDN'T KNOW
YOU HAD A GIRLFRIEND.

207
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:04,437
I DON'T.

208
00:10:10,276 --> 00:10:11,611
SO IT WAS DYLAN.

209
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:12,821
WHAT?

210
00:10:15,782 --> 00:10:17,742
DYLAN'S A FRIEND, MA.
I'M NOT GAY.

211
00:10:26,793 --> 00:10:27,460
(CRYING)

212
00:10:30,713 --> 00:10:31,214
I AM.

213
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:35,301
I AM.

214
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:41,641
MA, I'M GAY.

215
00:10:44,894 --> 00:10:45,562
(CRYING)

216
00:11:00,451 --> 00:11:03,079
SO...
LIBERTY AND CHRIS.

217
00:11:03,705 --> 00:11:05,206
IT'S A CRUSH.
BIG DEAL.

218
00:11:05,206 --> 00:11:07,333
MANNY:
FUNNY, I HEARD IT WAS A DATE...

219
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:09,294
TOMORROW,
AFTER SCHOOL.

220
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:14,424
LIBERTY SEES AN OPPORTUNITY,
SHE GOES FOR IT.

221
00:11:14,424 --> 00:11:16,801
SHE'S LIKE A RABID
WOLVERINE.

222
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:25,268
SO I'VE GOT EAR CANCER,
THANKS.

223
00:11:25,268 --> 00:11:25,935
LAST NIGHT,

224
00:11:25,935 --> 00:11:28,021
DYLAN HAD ME ON
THE PHONE FOR 3 HOURS,

225
00:11:28,021 --> 00:11:29,147
ALL WORRIED.

226
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:32,400
AND SINCE SANITY'S
FLED YOU,

227
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,568
I'M WORRIED TOO.

228
00:11:36,613 --> 00:11:38,072
I CAME OUT TO MY MOM
LAST NIGHT.

229
00:11:39,657 --> 00:11:40,825
(HAPPY SQUEAL)

230
00:11:42,327 --> 00:11:44,162
I LOVE YOU,
YOU KNOW THAT, RIGHT?

231
00:11:44,162 --> 00:11:45,079
YEAH.

232
00:11:45,788 --> 00:11:46,497
JUST...

233
00:11:46,497 --> 00:11:48,666
I HOPE SHE STILL DOES,
YOU KNOW?

234
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:50,001
I MEAN,
SHE SEEMED A LITTLE...

235
00:11:50,001 --> 00:11:52,795
ALL RIGHT,
SHE SEEMED A LOT-

236
00:11:52,795 --> 00:11:55,506
YOU'VE HAD A YEAR OF BEING GAY,
MARCO.

237
00:11:55,506 --> 00:11:58,343
SHE'S HAD A NIGHT
OF YOU BEING GAY.

238
00:11:58,343 --> 00:12:01,429
OKAY, I'M SO CALLING
DYLAN RIGHT NOW.

239
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:03,306
MARCO:
WHA-? HEY! HEY!

240
00:12:03,306 --> 00:12:04,140
WHAT'RE YOU DOING?

241
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:06,684
ALEX:
MOST YOU CAN SPEND
ON YOUR CAMPAIGN IS $40.00.

242
00:12:06,684 --> 00:12:08,561
PAIGE:
UM, THEY WERE FOR FREE.
HIS DAD IS-

243
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:09,854
DOESN'T MATTER.
UNFAIR ADVANTAGE.

244
00:12:10,438 --> 00:12:12,523
MARCO:
LOOK, WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS?

245
00:12:12,523 --> 00:12:14,067
BECAUSE YOU'RE RUNNING.

246
00:12:14,067 --> 00:12:15,526
AND BECAUSE I CAN.

247
00:12:15,526 --> 00:12:17,403
NOBODY IS GONNA VOTE
FOR YOU, OKAY?

248
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:17,862
NOBODY.

249
00:12:18,529 --> 00:12:19,614
NOT YET.

250
00:12:19,614 --> 00:12:20,365
NOT EVER.

251
00:12:20,365 --> 00:12:22,951
UNLESS THEY OPEN UP VOTES
TO HIGH SCHOOL DROP-OUTS

252
00:12:22,951 --> 00:12:24,744
OR YOUR PAROLE OFFICER.

253
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:25,578
WE'LL SEE.

254
00:12:26,204 --> 00:12:27,580
WE'LL ASK THE CROWD
TOMORROW AT THE ASSEMBLY,

255
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:29,207
SEE WHAT THEY SAY.

256
00:12:29,207 --> 00:12:31,042
"WHO WOULD YOU
RATHER VOTE FOR?

257
00:12:31,042 --> 00:12:33,211
THE FREAK?

258
00:12:33,211 --> 00:12:34,128
OR THE QUEER?"

259
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,298
BY THE WAY,
I'M THE FREAK.

260
00:12:43,638 --> 00:12:44,973
EMMA:
NICE FORM.

261
00:12:46,391 --> 00:12:48,726
HMPH.
DON'T TEASE ME.

262
00:12:48,726 --> 00:12:49,560
EMMA:
YOU KNOW,
WHAT YOU SAID YESTERDAY

263
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:50,895
ABOUT GETTING BACK TOGETHER?

264
00:12:50,895 --> 00:12:53,898
I'D REALLY, REALLY,
REALLY LIKE THAT.

265
00:12:54,816 --> 00:12:56,234
I SAID
DON'T TEASE ME.

266
00:12:56,234 --> 00:12:57,402
I'M NOT.

267
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:00,154
WHAT ABOUT TOMORROW
AFTER SCHOOL?

268
00:13:01,948 --> 00:13:03,282
TOMORROW?
I GOT-

269
00:13:05,743 --> 00:13:06,703
EMMA:
OKAY...

270
00:13:06,703 --> 00:13:09,163
I JUST THOUGHT WE COULD
START THIS YEAR OFF RIGHT.

271
00:13:10,498 --> 00:13:11,582
ALL RIGHT.

272
00:13:11,582 --> 00:13:13,126
I'LL SEE WHAT I CAN DO.

273
00:13:13,584 --> 00:13:13,960
OKAY.

274
00:13:14,669 --> 00:13:17,422
AND I WAS TEASING
ABOUT YOUR FORM, YOU KNOW.

275
00:13:17,422 --> 00:13:18,798
IT'S AWFUL.

276
00:13:20,258 --> 00:13:26,806
♪♪♪

277
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:28,433
MANNY:
OKAY, TOMORROW AFTER SCHOOL

278
00:13:28,433 --> 00:13:29,267
I'M GONNA COME OVER,

279
00:13:29,267 --> 00:13:31,102
AND I'M GONNA LOAN YOU
THE COOLEST NEW SKIRT.

280
00:13:31,102 --> 00:13:32,562
OKAY,
AND I NEED THIS WHY?

281
00:13:32,562 --> 00:13:34,188
FOR THE WHOLE
GET CHRIS BACK THING.

282
00:13:34,188 --> 00:13:36,190
I MEAN,
THOSE LEGS OF YOURS

283
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:37,775
THEY'RE A KILLER ASSET.

284
00:13:37,775 --> 00:13:40,361
I'M NOT TRYING
TO GET HIM BACK.

285
00:13:40,361 --> 00:13:42,113
BUT YOU LOVE HIM.

286
00:13:42,113 --> 00:13:43,531
I CAN SEE IT
IN YOUR EYES.

287
00:13:43,531 --> 00:13:44,323
I NEVER SAID THAT.

288
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:47,994
OKAY, I'M TOTALLY CONFUSED.

289
00:13:50,038 --> 00:13:51,289
I DIDN'T WANT HIM
TO GO ON A DATE.

290
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:53,124
BECAUSE YOU'RE JEALOUS?

291
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:56,502
OF LIBERTY VAN ZANDT?
YEAH.

292
00:13:57,462 --> 00:13:58,796
YOU'RE EMBARRASSED?

293
00:13:59,130 --> 00:13:59,922
EMMA:
YOU WOULDN'T BE?

294
00:14:02,341 --> 00:14:03,634
WHAT ARE PEOPLE
GONNA THINK OF ME

295
00:14:03,634 --> 00:14:05,470
IF CHRIS GOES OUT
WITH LIBERTY NEXT?

296
00:14:08,931 --> 00:14:11,976
THAT'S THE MEANEST THING
I'VE EVER HEARD YOU SAY.

297
00:14:13,394 --> 00:14:16,814
AND THAT'S REALLY SAYING
SOMETHING.

298
00:14:20,735 --> 00:14:21,986
MARCO:
MAYBE WE CAN TELL PAPA

299
00:14:21,986 --> 00:14:23,780
THAT THE ASSEMBLY'S
STUDENTS ONLY.

300
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:25,239
THAT PARENTS ARE NOT ALLOWED.

301
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:28,159
MRS. DEL ROSSI:
YOU WOULD LIE TO HIM LIKE THAT?

302
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:33,331
WELL, MAYBE...

303
00:14:33,998 --> 00:14:34,874
MAYBE WE DON'T HAVE TO.

304
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:36,584
MAYBE ALEX IS JUST BLUFFING;

305
00:14:36,584 --> 00:14:38,294
TRYING TO FREAK ME OUT
BEFORE MY SPEECH.

306
00:14:38,836 --> 00:14:40,004
AND IF SHE'S NOT?

307
00:14:40,671 --> 00:14:42,465
LOOK, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO DO, MA.

308
00:14:52,558 --> 00:14:54,018
IT BREAKS MY HEART

309
00:14:54,936 --> 00:14:57,021
THAT BECAUSE YOU ARE GAY,

310
00:14:58,648 --> 00:14:59,649
THESE PEOPLE WILL HATE YOU.

311
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:02,235
MA, NOBODY HATES ME.

312
00:15:02,735 --> 00:15:03,569
THIS GIRL?

313
00:15:04,237 --> 00:15:05,363
YEAH,
BUT THAT'S NOT BECAUSE I'M-

314
00:15:05,363 --> 00:15:07,949
MR. DEL ROSSI:
I'M HOME!

315
00:15:10,868 --> 00:15:11,702
HEY!

316
00:15:12,328 --> 00:15:14,705
THE POSTERS,
THEY WORKED GOOD, MARCO?

317
00:15:15,873 --> 00:15:17,041
PA, I'M DROPPING OUT
OF THE ELECTION.

318
00:15:18,334 --> 00:15:20,044
LOOK, I TALKED TO THE PRESIDENT
FROM LAST YEAR,

319
00:15:20,044 --> 00:15:21,504
AND HE SAID
IT'S A LOT OF WORK.

320
00:15:21,504 --> 00:15:22,547
MR. DEL ROSSI:
NO, NO, MARCO.

321
00:15:22,547 --> 00:15:23,840
YOU WILL DO IT.

322
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:24,841
BUT MY STUDIES
ARE GONNA-

323
00:15:24,841 --> 00:15:25,550
NO, MARCO!

324
00:15:26,175 --> 00:15:28,219
FOR RUNNING,
I AM PROUD OF YOU.

325
00:15:28,219 --> 00:15:29,595
BUT NOW QUITTING?

326
00:15:30,304 --> 00:15:32,807
NO. DON'T MAKE ME
LESS PROUD.

327
00:15:52,285 --> 00:15:52,910
HEY LIBERTY!

328
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:55,079
I THINK I'M ACTUALLY
VOTING FOR ALEX TODAY.

329
00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:55,997
ARE YOU?

330
00:15:55,997 --> 00:15:58,040
YOU'RE DEAD TO ME.

331
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:58,958
WHAT?

332
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:00,793
MANNY TOLD ME.

333
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:02,336
JEALOUSY'S REALLY UGLY,
EMMA.

334
00:16:02,336 --> 00:16:04,005
NO. NO. NO.
LIBERTY...

335
00:16:05,214 --> 00:16:06,757
IT'S HARD FOR ME
LETTING CHRIS GO,

336
00:16:06,757 --> 00:16:07,466
THAT'S ALL.

337
00:16:07,842 --> 00:16:09,218
GUESS WHAT?

338
00:16:09,218 --> 00:16:10,386
IT'S EASY FOR ME
LETTING YOU GO...

339
00:16:10,386 --> 00:16:12,096
STRAIGHT TO HELL.

340
00:16:12,096 --> 00:16:14,265
RADITCH:
ALL STUDENTS ARE REMINDED
TO REPORT TO THE GYM

341
00:16:14,265 --> 00:16:17,393
FOR STUDENT COUNCIL ELECTIONS,
NOT HOME ROOM.

342
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:20,938
ALEX:
I FEEL LIKE I'M GONNA BARF.

343
00:16:20,938 --> 00:16:21,772
JAY:
DON'T TELL ME YOU'RE SERIOUS

344
00:16:21,772 --> 00:16:23,107
ABOUT THESE STUPID ELECTIONS.

345
00:16:23,107 --> 00:16:24,108
ALEX.

346
00:16:24,108 --> 00:16:25,151
JUST WHO I WANTED
TO SEE.

347
00:16:25,151 --> 00:16:26,110
WHAT?

348
00:16:26,944 --> 00:16:28,529
YESTERDAY, WHEN YOU SAID
YOU'D CALL ME GAY

349
00:16:28,529 --> 00:16:29,780
IN FRONT
OF THE WHOLE SCHOOL-

350
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:30,615
I WAS GONNA
CALL YOU "QUEER,"

351
00:16:30,615 --> 00:16:31,782
BUT IF YOU
PREFER "GAY"...

352
00:16:31,782 --> 00:16:34,118
MARCO:
I DON'T, THANKS.

353
00:16:34,118 --> 00:16:35,912
LOOK, YOU HAVE AN ACTUAL CHANCE
AT WINNING THIS.

354
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:38,748
YOU THINK?

355
00:16:38,748 --> 00:16:40,499
SO CALL ME "GAY," "QUEER"
WHATEVER.

356
00:16:40,499 --> 00:16:42,460
BUT IS THAT
HOW YOU WANT TO FIGHT?

357
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:43,294
OR DO YOU WANNA TRY

358
00:16:43,294 --> 00:16:44,879
AND WIN THIS ELECTION
FOR REAL.

359
00:16:45,963 --> 00:16:48,257
JAY:
SAVE IT FOR MS. SAUVE.

360
00:16:53,804 --> 00:16:55,723
ALEX:
IT'S ALWAYS THE SAME.

361
00:16:55,723 --> 00:16:57,975
SOME PRETTY BOY OR GIRL
WANTS TO BE PRESIDENT,

362
00:16:57,975 --> 00:16:58,935
AND ME... WE...

363
00:17:00,895 --> 00:17:03,147
SIT OUT WHILE THEY HAVE THEIR
"SPECIAL DANCES"

364
00:17:03,147 --> 00:17:05,399
OR TRIPS NOBODY CAN AFFORD.

365
00:17:06,651 --> 00:17:08,152
SO I SAY SCREW 'EM.

366
00:17:08,152 --> 00:17:09,153
SCREW STUDENT COUNCIL.

367
00:17:09,153 --> 00:17:12,615
I SAY NO DANCES,
NO TRIPS, NOTHING.

368
00:17:12,615 --> 00:17:15,910
NOT IF IT'S GOING TO BE
JUST LIKE LAST YEAR.

369
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:17,870
BUT TAKE A CHANCE,
AND VOTE FOR ME?

370
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:19,830
IT WON'T BE LIKE LAST YEAR.

371
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:22,959
I WILL MAKE CHANGES
WHERE THEY COUNT.

372
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:24,377
SO IT'S UP TO YOU,
DEGRASSI.

373
00:17:24,377 --> 00:17:26,003
WHAT'RE YOU GONNA DO?

374
00:17:26,003 --> 00:17:27,838
ARE YOU GONNA VOTE
FOR THE FREAK?

375
00:17:33,844 --> 00:17:34,845
OR THE PRETTY BOY?

376
00:17:37,557 --> 00:17:38,975
'CAUSE YOU'LL HAVE MORE FUN
WITH THE FREAK.

377
00:17:40,184 --> 00:17:41,018
(APPLAUSE)

378
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:47,358
THANK YOU, ALEX.

379
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:50,861
UP NEXT IS MARCO DEL ROSSI.

380
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:54,240
PAIGE:
MARCO!

381
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,074
(CHEERING)

382
00:18:04,792 --> 00:18:06,419
LOOK, SHE'S RIGHT.

383
00:18:06,419 --> 00:18:07,753
NO, ALEX IS RIGHT.

384
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:08,754
THE SCHOOL'S SPLIT.

385
00:18:10,464 --> 00:18:13,676
BUT... WHERE SHE'S WRONG?

386
00:18:13,676 --> 00:18:16,345
LOOK, COME ON,
IT'S NOT THE PRESIDENT'S JOB

387
00:18:16,345 --> 00:18:18,681
TO REMIND US
THAT WE'RE FREAKS.

388
00:18:18,681 --> 00:18:20,474
I MEAN, I DO THAT FINE
ALL BY MYSELF.

389
00:18:20,474 --> 00:18:21,642
QUEER! (COUGH)

390
00:18:25,605 --> 00:18:26,606
RADITCH:
MISTER HOGHART,

391
00:18:26,606 --> 00:18:28,149
I'LL SEE YOU AFTER
IN MY OFFICE.

392
00:18:29,442 --> 00:18:30,109
PAIGE:
MARCO!

393
00:18:34,071 --> 00:18:35,031
HEY! QUEER?

394
00:18:37,575 --> 00:18:38,242
SURE.

395
00:18:38,701 --> 00:18:39,744
ODD? WHY NOT?

396
00:18:40,578 --> 00:18:41,954
STRANGE? YOU BET.

397
00:18:44,248 --> 00:18:45,833
I LOVE THIS SCHOOL.

398
00:18:46,459 --> 00:18:48,544
AND I PROMISE
IF YOU VOTE FOR ME,

399
00:18:48,544 --> 00:18:51,589
I WILL BRING DEGRASSI
TOGETHER IN...

400
00:18:52,089 --> 00:18:55,051
FREAKISH HARMONY
FOR THE FIRST TIME.

401
00:18:57,219 --> 00:18:57,928
FOR REAL.

402
00:19:01,098 --> 00:19:01,932
THANK YOU.

403
00:19:03,434 --> 00:19:05,353
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

404
00:19:15,196 --> 00:19:17,740
THE FIRST COUNCIL MEETING
WILL BE THURSDAY AT LUNCH.

405
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:18,949
AND LAST BUT NOT LEAST,

406
00:19:18,949 --> 00:19:21,327
YOUR STUDENT COUNCIL
PRESIDENT IS...

407
00:19:21,327 --> 00:19:22,661
MARCO DEL ROSSI!

408
00:19:23,621 --> 00:19:24,455
(APPLAUSE)

409
00:19:28,918 --> 00:19:30,586
OUT OF MY WAY.

410
00:19:30,586 --> 00:19:31,837
I GET TO PICK
MY VICE PRESIDENT.

411
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:33,089
I GET TO PICK MY NOSE.

412
00:19:34,298 --> 00:19:34,715
ALEX.

413
00:19:38,552 --> 00:19:39,804
I DON'T PLAY WELL
WITH OTHERS.

414
00:19:40,971 --> 00:19:43,724
GOOD.
I'M NOT ASKING YOU TO PLAY.

415
00:19:46,102 --> 00:19:48,562
I REALLY LIKED YOUR SPEECH.

416
00:19:48,562 --> 00:19:50,314
BUT, MOST IMPORTANT,

417
00:19:50,314 --> 00:19:51,774
I THINK YOU CAN BRING
A LOT TO THE POSITION.

418
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:57,780
THURSDAY, RIGHT?

419
00:19:57,780 --> 00:19:59,198
BRING YOUR LUNCH.

420
00:20:05,496 --> 00:20:07,456
DYLAN:
CONGRATULATIONS,
MR. PRESIDENT.

421
00:20:07,456 --> 00:20:08,624
SO, WHAT DOES IT FEEL LIKE

422
00:20:08,624 --> 00:20:10,960
TO BE THE MOST POWERFUL MAN
AT DEGRASSI?

423
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,837
MIXING ME UP
WITH MR. RADITCH, EH?

424
00:20:12,837 --> 00:20:14,797
NOT COOL
NOR FLATTERING.

425
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:20,052
I LIKED YOU BEING HERE
TODAY, DYLAN.

426
00:20:20,678 --> 00:20:23,055
PROBABLY BECAUSE I JUST
PLAIN OLD LIKE YOU.

427
00:20:26,016 --> 00:20:27,101
I TOLD MY MOM.

428
00:20:27,101 --> 00:20:29,353
DYLAN:
PAIGE TOLD ME.

429
00:20:29,937 --> 00:20:32,314
BUT I'M NOT READY
TO TELL MY DAD,

430
00:20:32,314 --> 00:20:33,315
NOT YET.

431
00:20:33,315 --> 00:20:35,401
YOU'RE EVENTUALLY GONNA
HAVE TO TELL HIM,

432
00:20:35,401 --> 00:20:37,236
BUT WHEN YOU'RE READY.

433
00:20:37,862 --> 00:20:38,654
AND I'M OKAY
WITH THAT PART.

434
00:20:39,822 --> 00:20:41,198
MR. DEL ROSSI:
HEY MR. PRESIDENTE!

435
00:20:41,198 --> 00:20:43,701
THAT'S OUR NEW PRESIDENT, HUH?

436
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:46,454
I'M SO HAPPY FOR HIM.

437
00:20:46,454 --> 00:20:48,539
SO HOW MUCH DID YOU WIN BY?

438
00:20:48,539 --> 00:20:49,123
MARCO:
I WON.

439
00:20:49,123 --> 00:20:49,999
LET'S LEAVE IT AT THAT.

440
00:20:50,499 --> 00:20:53,169
I STILL THINK YOU COULD HAVE
USED MORE POSTERS.

441
00:20:53,169 --> 00:20:54,920
MARCO, THAT BOY.

442
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,380
WHAT HE CALLED OUT?

443
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:57,756
AND WHAT YOU ANSWERED BACK?

444
00:20:57,756 --> 00:20:58,841
WHAT IS THAT?

445
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:06,515
DIRTY POLITICS.

446
00:21:06,515 --> 00:21:07,850
I MEAN, I GUESS "QUEER"
WAS THE WORST THING

447
00:21:07,850 --> 00:21:09,226
HE THOUGHT HE COULD CALL ME,
YOU KNOW?

448
00:21:10,978 --> 00:21:11,854
STILL,

449
00:21:11,854 --> 00:21:14,398
YOU MAKE ME AND YOUR MAMA
VERY PROUD OF YOU TODAY.

450
00:21:14,398 --> 00:21:16,275
VERY PROUD.

451
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:16,984
DIDN'T HE, DYLAN?

452
00:21:18,444 --> 00:21:20,696
HE WON, MRS. DEL ROSSI
AND...

453
00:21:20,696 --> 00:21:21,739
I THINK THAT'S GREAT.

454
00:21:28,871 --> 00:21:30,956
MRS. DEL ROSSI:
ANDIAMO.
