CRAIG'S DAD,

180
00:09:05,838 --> 00:09:07,798
HE WASN'T THE MOST STABLE GUY,
WAS HE?

181
00:09:07,881 --> 00:09:10,133
CRAIG IS NOTHING
LIKE HIS DAD.

182
00:09:10,217 --> 00:09:12,094
ALL RIGHT? HE'S JUST-
HE'S JUST BEING A TEENAGER.

183
00:09:12,886 --> 00:09:14,221
I SEE A LOT OF TEENAGERS
EVERY DAY

184
00:09:14,304 --> 00:09:15,973
AND I'M AFRAID CRAIG'S GOING
THROUGH SOMETHING MORE.

185
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:18,684
LOOK SNAKE...
(TELEPHONE RINGS)

186
00:09:18,767 --> 00:09:21,019

00:09:21,103 --> 00:09:22,521
BBUT THERE'S NOTHING WRONG
WITH CRAIG

188
00:09:22,604 --> 00:09:24,022
THAT A GOOD GROUNDING
WON'T TAKE CARE OF.

189
00:09:25,023 --> 00:09:26,358
ALL RIGHT?

190
00:09:27,317 --> 00:09:28,360
IT'S FOR YOU.

191
00:09:29,945 --> 00:09:30,988
HELLO?

192
00:09:31,071 --> 00:09:33,323
THIS IS MR. JEREMIAH.

193
00:09:34,283 --> 00:09:35,450
DAMAGES?

194
00:09:36,618 --> 00:09:38,287
MY HOTEL ROOM?

195
00:09:39,872 --> 00:09:41,206

KATE:
(LAUGHING)
NO SERIOUSLY.

198
00:09:48,088 --> 00:09:51,300
AS ROBERT'S EX-WIFE,
IT'S NOT USUAL I'D BE HERE.

199
00:09:51,383 --> 00:09:53,260
ESPECIALLY SINCE HE'S MARRYING

200
00:09:53,343 --> 00:09:55,679
SOMEONE YOUNGER
AND PRETTIER THAN ME.

201
00:09:55,762 --> 00:09:56,597
(LAUGHTER)

202
00:09:57,514 --> 00:09:59,266
OUR FAMILY MAY BE UNUSUAL,

203
00:09:59,349 --> 00:10:01,602
BUT IT'S ONE I'M THANKFUL FOR.

204
00:10:01,685 --> 00:10:04,646

HI. I'M CRAIG MANNING.
I'M ONLY ASHLEY'S BOYFRIEND.

209
00:10:15,157 --> 00:10:17,451
I'M NOT PART
OF THE "UNUSUAL" FAMILY

210
00:10:17,534 --> 00:10:20,996
MS. KERWIN'S TALKED ABOUT,
WELL NOT YET.

211
00:10:21,079 --> 00:10:23,373
KATE:
IS THERE A TOAST IN THIS,
CRAIG?

212
00:10:23,457 --> 00:10:24,833
THERE'S AN ANNOUNCEMENT.

213
00:10:24,917 --> 00:10:26,710
CRAIG, DON'T.

214
00:10:26,793 --> 00:10:28,045
ASH AND I ARE GETTING MARRIED.

215
00:10:28,128 --> 00:10:29,630
ASHLEY:

218
00:10:49,066 --> 00:10:51,068
HEY, WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

219
00:10:51,151 --> 00:10:53,904
ASHLEY:
WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?!

220
00:10:53,987 --> 00:10:55,405
CRAIG:
I SAW YOUR DAD GET MARRIED.

221
00:10:55,489 --> 00:10:56,198
ASHLEY:
OH, OH, OH.

222
00:10:56,281 --> 00:10:56,990
AND YOU THOUGHT
PERFECT TIME

223
00:10:57,074 --> 00:10:58,534
TO ANNOUNCE
OUR FUTURE LIFE.

224
00:10:58,617 --> 00:11:02,204
THIS MORNING YOU SAID
THAT YOU WANTED TO BE TOGETHER.

225
00:11:02,287 --> 00:11:03,747
AND RIGHT NOW
I'M CHANGING MY MIND.

226
00:11:05,374 --> 00:11:06,291
ASHLEY,
ARE YOU OKAY?

227
00:11:07,209 --> 00:11:08,669
I WILL BE.

228
00:11:08,752 --> 00:11:09,670
AS SOON AS CRAIG LEAVES.

229
00:11:10,963 --> 00:11:12,965
YOU ARE EVERYTHING, ASH.

230
00:11:14,424 --> 00:11:16,260
CRAIG, I WANT YOU
TO GO HOME NOW.

231
00:11:18,428 --> 00:11:18,846
OKAY.

232
00:11:19,763 --> 00:11:21,098
OKAY, ALL RIGHT.

233
00:11:22,766 --> 00:11:23,767
BUT I HAVE TO DO
SOMETHING FIRST.

234
00:11:25,102 --> 00:11:26,103
THAT'S NOT HOME, CRAIG!

235
00:11:36,238 --> 00:11:37,239
CRAIG:
I HAVE TO TALK TO YOU.

236
00:11:37,322 --> 00:11:39,157
BOTH OF YOU AND KATE.

237
00:11:39,241 --> 00:11:40,951
CRAIG, PLEASE,
NOT IN FRONT OF THE GUESTS

238
00:11:41,034 --> 00:11:41,618
IT'S URGENT, SIR.

239
00:11:41,702 --> 00:11:44,204
KATE:
ASHLEY, COULD YOU PLEASE
ASK CRAIG TO WAIT OUTSIDE.

240
00:11:44,288 --> 00:11:44,872
I'M TRYING, MOM.

241
00:11:45,956 --> 00:11:47,457
I LOVE ASHLEY.

242
00:11:47,541 --> 00:11:49,501
AND TO HAVE TO KEEP-

243
00:11:49,585 --> 00:11:52,171
TO KEEP PROVING THAT
IS DISRESPECTFUL

244
00:11:52,254 --> 00:11:53,213
AND IT'S OBNOXIOUS!

245
00:11:53,297 --> 00:11:54,423
WE'LL TALK ABOUT
THIS LATER.

246
00:11:54,506 --> 00:11:56,216
CRAIG:
WE CAN BUT WE WON'T.

247
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:57,634
YOU'RE GOING TO TELL ASH
TO STOP SEEING ME AGAIN.

248
00:11:57,718 --> 00:11:59,178
ONLY THIS TIME...

249
00:11:59,261 --> 00:12:01,138

LOOK SIT DOWN!

356
00:17:45,148 --> 00:17:46,817

357
00:17:47,401 --> 00:17:48,569

358
00:17:51,613 --> 00:17:53,740

359
00:17:53,824 --> 00:17:54,783
ANGELA:

360
00:17:55,492 --> 00:17:56,243

361
00:17:57,536 --> 00:17:59,538
CAITLIN:

362
00:18:01,373 --> 00:18:02,416
STOP IT!

363
00:18:02,499 --> 00:18:03,792
CRAIG, STOP IT!

364
00:18:05,502 --> 00:18:06,628

367
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:11,800
CRAIG.

368
00:18:14,094 --> 00:18:15,262
YOU CAME BACK.

369
00:18:17,306 --> 00:18:19,183
ANGELA:
DADDY! DADDY!

370
00:18:19,266 --> 00:18:20,100
YOU-

371
00:18:21,393 --> 00:18:23,353
YEAH, YEAH I DID.

372
00:18:24,188 --> 00:18:25,147
AFTER EVERYTHING
THAT HAPPENED,

373
00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:27,149
AFTER ALL THAT I DID,
YOU CAME BACK.

374
00:18:27,232 --> 00:18:30,068
CRAIG.
CRAIG, YOU NEED HELP.

375
00:18:32,738 --> 00:18:35,574
ANGELA:
DADDY, ARE YOU OKAY?

376
00:18:45,542 --> 00:18:48,128
WE'RE GONNA GET YOU HELP.

377
00:18:56,970 --> 00:18:58,055
JT:
DON'T THINK OF IT AS DETENTION.

378
00:18:58,138 --> 00:19:01,183
THINK OF US
AS EXIT DELAYED.

379
00:19:01,266 --> 00:19:04,061
THANKS,
I'M HERE ALL WEEK.

380
00:19:04,144 --> 00:19:05,354
I DON'T KNOW WHY
YOU'RE HERE.

381
00:19:05,437 --> 00:19:08,357
I MEAN, I'M THE ONE
WHO SANG THE STUPID SONG.

382
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:10,025
YEAH, BUT IT WAS
TOTALLY WORTH IT.

383
00:19:10,108 --> 00:19:14,279
THE LOOK ON RADITCH'S FACE
WHEN HE FIRED US.

384
00:19:15,239 --> 00:19:16,823
NOT HELPING, JT.

385
00:19:16,907 --> 00:19:18,242
I'M SORRY.

386
00:19:19,076 --> 00:19:21,286
I'M SORRY THAT
I CHICKENED OUT.

387
00:19:21,370 --> 00:19:22,746
BUT WHAT YOU DID,

388
00:19:22,829 --> 00:19:24,915
THE WAY THAT YOU
STOOD UP TO RADITCH,

389
00:19:24,998 --> 00:19:26,458
TOOK GUTS.

390
00:19:26,542 --> 00:19:27,876
BRILLIANT.

391
00:19:29,169 --> 00:19:32,172
YOU KNOW WHAT
I WISH I'D DONE?

392
00:19:41,014 --> 00:19:43,976
I'VE CRUSHED ON YOU
FOR FOUR YEARS.

393
00:19:54,027 --> 00:19:56,697
MY STOMACH HURTS
A LITTLE.

394
00:20:01,368 --> 00:20:04,204
CRAIG:
I STILL CAN'T SLEEP.

395
00:20:04,288 --> 00:20:06,248
I'VE GOT 17 NEW SONGS.

396
00:20:06,331 --> 00:20:08,750
MORE IN A WEEK THAN
I'VE WRITTEN MY WHOLE LIFE.

397
00:20:08,834 --> 00:20:10,669
BUT YOU'RE OKAY?

398
00:20:12,004 --> 00:20:13,714
I'M CRAZY, ASH.

399
00:20:14,381 --> 00:20:15,757
YOU'RE NOT CRAZY.

400
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:18,969
WELL THEN EXPLAIN
THE MEDICATION

401
00:20:19,052 --> 00:20:22,639
AND THIS TRENDY BRACELET
ON MY WRIST.

402
00:20:22,723 --> 00:20:23,515
AND EXPLAIN WHY,

403
00:20:23,599 --> 00:20:25,684
DESPITE EVERYTHING
THEY TELL ME,

404
00:20:25,767 --> 00:20:27,269
I FEEL FINE.

405
00:20:27,769 --> 00:20:29,521
YOU'RE BI-POLAR.

406
00:20:29,605 --> 00:20:32,274
YOU'VE GOT A CHEMICAL IMBALANCE
IN YOUR BRAIN

407
00:20:32,357 --> 00:20:33,108
BUT YOU'RE GETTING HELP.

408
00:20:34,276 --> 00:20:35,068
MAYBE YOU SHOULD GO.

409
00:20:36,862 --> 00:20:37,613
I DON'T WANT TO.

410
00:20:38,906 --> 00:20:40,699
LOOK, I WON'T BLAME YOU
IF YOU WANT TO LEAVE.

411
00:20:40,782 --> 00:20:41,450
JUST GO.

412
00:20:51,585 --> 00:20:54,171
IF I'M SICK LIKE THEY SAY
I AM,

413
00:20:54,755 --> 00:20:58,717
I'M GOING TO BE MANAGING THIS
FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE.

414
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:00,552
MEDICATIONS, SHRINKS...

415
00:21:10,521 --> 00:21:11,688
I'M NOT LEAVING, CRAIG.

416
00:21:14,024 --> 00:21:17,736
THE FIRST TIME WE DATED
IT WAS A DISASTER.

417
00:21:17,819 --> 00:21:20,155
THIS TIME WAS NUCLEAR.

418
00:21:21,073 --> 00:21:22,324
WE'RE NOT OVER.

419
00:21:23,575 --> 00:21:24,284
SO...

420
00:21:25,536 --> 00:21:27,704
YOU'RE HERE WITH ME?

421
00:21:30,499 --> 00:21:32,000
ABSOLUTELY.
