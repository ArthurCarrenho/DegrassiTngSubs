1
00:00:03,921 --> 00:00:04,922
MARCO:
SO FOR TOMORROW,
ELLIE?

2
00:00:05,005 --> 00:00:06,882
I NEED YOU TO HAND OUT
STICKERS, OKAY?

3
00:00:06,965 --> 00:00:08,592
CRAIG, I NEED YOU
TO PACK BLOOD BAGS.

4
00:00:08,675 --> 00:00:09,676
AND ALEX-

5
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:10,177
ALEX!

6
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:13,514
THIS I WILL NOT
BE WEARING.

7
00:00:13,597 --> 00:00:14,932
IT'S FOR TV -

8
00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:16,558
CAITLIN RYAN'S
COMMUNITY SHOW.

9
00:00:16,642 --> 00:00:17,684
LOOK, WHEN PEOPLE SEE
"DEGRASSI",

10
00:00:17,768 --> 00:00:19,811
I WANT THEM TO THINK,
CUTE AND CUDDLY.

11
00:00:19,895 --> 00:00:21,063
I'M GOING TO
CLOBBER YOU.

12
00:00:21,146 --> 00:00:22,648
THAT'S NOT CUDDLY.

13
00:00:23,232 --> 00:00:24,983
AND AS A PRESIDENT
SPEAKING TO HIS VICE...

14
00:00:25,067 --> 00:00:26,318
ALL RIGHT.
CALM DOWN.

15
00:00:26,401 --> 00:00:28,779
EVERYTHING HAS TO BE PERFECT.

16
00:00:29,613 --> 00:00:30,364
ELLIE:
SHE'S RIGHT.

17
00:00:30,447 --> 00:00:32,533
WHAT YOU'VE DONE
FOR THE SCHOOL THIS YEAR...

18
00:00:32,616 --> 00:00:34,618
EVER CONSIDER RUNNING
A SECOND TERM?

19
00:00:34,701 --> 00:00:37,996
ALEX:
FOUR MORE YEARS!
FOUR MORE YEARS!

20
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:38,789
I CAN'T.

21
00:00:40,374 --> 00:00:41,041
I WAS THINKING
OF PICKING UP

22
00:00:41,124 --> 00:00:43,210
A FEW EXTRA CREDITS
THIS SUMMER.

23
00:00:43,293 --> 00:00:44,044
THIS WAY,

24
00:00:44,586 --> 00:00:47,214
I CAN GRADUATE AFTER
FIRST SEMESTER'S DONE.

25
00:00:47,297 --> 00:00:48,382
MAYBE EVEN MOVE IN
WITH DYLAN

26
00:00:48,465 --> 00:00:49,967
BEFORE UNIVERSITY.

27
00:00:51,969 --> 00:00:53,554
MY BOYFRIEND?

28
00:00:54,096 --> 00:00:55,681
ALL RIGHT, YOU GUYS KNOW
I'M GAY, RIGHT?

29
00:00:56,515 --> 00:00:58,851
I'M STUCK ON
"GRADUATING EARLY".

30
00:00:59,518 --> 00:01:00,894
I'M ON
"MOVE IN WITH DYLAN".

31
00:01:01,603 --> 00:01:04,189
GUYS, IT'S NOT
THAT BIG A DEAL.

32
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:07,985
OKAY, IT'S HUGE.

00:02:01,038 --> 00:02:01,955
MARCO?

46
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:05,292
THE DAY'S GOING
TO GO FINE.

47
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:06,293
THERE'S BEEN A BEE
IN THIS CAR

48
00:02:06,376 --> 00:02:07,294
FOR THE ENTIRE RIDE.

49
00:02:07,377 --> 00:02:09,463
FEAR IS MY FRIEND.

50
00:02:09,546 --> 00:02:09,922
YOU KNOW,
A YEAR AGO,

51
00:02:10,005 --> 00:02:11,423
YOU WOULD HAVE JUMPED OUT
OF A MOVING VEHICLE.

52
00:02:11,507 --> 00:02:12,716
YEAH, WELL,
A YEAR AGO,

53
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:14,801
I WASN'T WITH YOU.

54
00:02:17,513 --> 00:02:18,222
GO...

55
00:02:18,972 --> 00:02:20,974
BACK TO YOUR DORM.

56
00:02:24,436 --> 00:02:25,812
I'LL SEE YOU TONIGHT.

57
00:02:25,896 --> 00:02:27,523
AT THE PARTY.

58
00:02:30,567 --> 00:02:33,195
SPIKE:
IT'S LIKE BREAST-FEEDING
ONLY OUT OF YOUR ARM.

59
00:02:33,278 --> 00:02:35,697
EMMA:
I THINKS IT'S FASTER
IF YOU'RE QUIET.

60
00:02:35,781 --> 00:02:37,449
CAITLIN:
SO YOU INHERITED A SCHOOL

61
00:02:37,533 --> 00:02:38,825
WHERE A STUDENT DIED

62
00:02:38,909 --> 00:02:40,118
AND ANOTHER, PARALYZED.

63
00:02:40,202 --> 00:02:43,830
HATZILAKOS:
NOT THE BEST SITUATION
TO ASSUME PRINCIPAL, I AGREE.

64
00:02:43,914 --> 00:02:45,707
CAITLIN:
AND YET YOU'VE MANAGED
TO TURN IT ALL AROUND?

65
00:02:45,791 --> 00:02:46,959
HATZILAKOS:
OH, NO. NOT ME.

66
00:02:47,042 --> 00:02:48,752
MARCO'S THE HERO HERE.

67
00:02:48,836 --> 00:02:51,380
ORGANIZING THE DANCES,
THE ASSEMBLIES.

68
00:02:51,463 --> 00:02:53,382
THAT'S WHERE
THE WORK HAS BEEN.

69
00:02:53,465 --> 00:02:54,800
CAITLIN:
HAVE YOU DONATED YET, MARCO?

70
00:02:54,883 --> 00:02:55,676
WELL, I'M PLANNING-

71
00:02:55,759 --> 00:02:56,718
ALEX!

72
00:02:58,095 --> 00:03:00,305
WILL YOU STOP
TACKLING ME?!

73
00:03:00,389 --> 00:03:01,139
CUT.

74
00:03:02,891 --> 00:03:04,142
SO WHEN'S THIS
GOING TO AIR?

75
00:03:04,226 --> 00:03:06,144
8:00 P.M.
TONIGHT.

76
00:03:06,228 --> 00:03:08,313
AND I WANNA ADD SOME
SHOTS OF MARCO DONATING.

77
00:03:09,064 --> 00:03:11,400
WHEN YOU'RE RECOVERED.

78
00:03:17,573 --> 00:03:20,117
(REPEATED CLINK OF SPOON
HITTING A GLASS)

79
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,793
IF I'M STILL SERVING YOU
TEN YEARS FROM NOW,

80
00:03:29,877 --> 00:03:31,253
KILL ME, ALL RIGHT?

81
00:03:31,336 --> 00:03:33,881
STUDY HARD
AND STAY IN SCHOOL.

82
00:03:33,964 --> 00:03:37,259
OH, RIGHT.
YOU GOT US EXPELLED.

83
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:43,182
SPINNER:
HERE YOU GO, LADIES.

84
00:03:43,265 --> 00:03:45,475
CLARE'LL BE WITH YOU
IN A MOMENT

85
00:03:45,559 --> 00:03:45,726
TO TAKE YOUR ORDER.

86
00:03:45,809 --> 00:03:47,936
MARY:
WE ASKED FOR LEMON
WITH OUR WATER.

87
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:48,979
(DOG BARKS)

88
00:03:52,149 --> 00:03:53,400
YOU CAN'T BRING
A DOG IN HERE.

89
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:56,987
I DIDN'T HEAR COMPLAINTS.

90
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:57,654
LADIES?

91
00:03:59,656 --> 00:04:02,409
WE'LL HAVE
THE LUNCH MENUS INSTEAD.

92
00:04:02,492 --> 00:04:04,411
I'M JUST GOING OFF SHIFT,
SO CLARE-

93
00:04:04,494 --> 00:04:05,579
MARY:
AND LEMON FOR THE WATER,

94
00:04:05,662 --> 00:04:07,623
AND A BOWL FOR
BABY BEAR HERE,

95
00:04:07,706 --> 00:04:10,209
SO SHE CAN HAVE SOME,
TOO.

96
00:04:10,292 --> 00:04:12,211
(BABY TALKS TO HER DOG)

97
00:04:17,174 --> 00:04:18,634
SO IF I PASS OUT
AND START DROOLING,

98
00:04:18,717 --> 00:04:19,551
SWEAR YOU'LL STOP
FILMING?

99
00:04:19,551 --> 00:04:22,012
DAVIS:
MR. DEL ROSSI?

100
00:04:22,012 --> 00:04:25,224
COULD YOU PLEASE
ASK THEM TO STOP FILMING
FOR JUST A MINUTE?

101
00:04:25,224 --> 00:04:26,141
CAITLIN:
WE'RE NOT SHOOTING
THE WHOLE "GIVING OF BLOOD".

102
00:04:27,017 --> 00:04:29,478
WE'RE JUST GONNA SHOOT A FEW
FRAMES OF THE PRESIDENT.

103
00:04:29,561 --> 00:04:32,314
DAVIS:
I'M SORRY, MS. RYAN.

104
00:04:34,191 --> 00:04:37,236
IS THERE SOME
KIND OF PROBLEM?

105
00:04:37,319 --> 00:04:40,113
THERE'S A QUESTION HERE
THAT YOU ANSWERED "YES" BESIDE.

106
00:04:40,197 --> 00:04:41,490
IT ASKS IF I'M MALE,

107
00:04:41,573 --> 00:04:43,200
IF I'VE HAD-

108
00:04:44,701 --> 00:04:45,619
WITH ANOTHER MALE.

109
00:04:45,702 --> 00:04:47,037
YES,
IF YOU'VE HAD SEX.

110
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:47,371
SO?

111
00:04:47,913 --> 00:04:51,124
WELL, IT'S POLICY,
YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND,

112
00:04:51,208 --> 00:04:53,836
BUT I CAN'T LET YOU
BE A DONOR.

113
00:05:03,762 --> 00:05:04,429
(KNOCKS)

114
00:05:06,932 --> 00:05:07,975
YOU SHOULDN'T BE HERE,
GAVIN.

115
00:05:09,726 --> 00:05:10,853
I DIDN'T MAKE
AN APPOINTMENT.

116
00:05:10,936 --> 00:05:11,937
I WAS AFRAID
YOU WOULDN'T SEE ME.

117
00:05:14,356 --> 00:05:16,650
I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW,

118
00:05:16,733 --> 00:05:17,818
THIS "BEING EXPELLED"?

119
00:05:17,901 --> 00:05:19,736
I'M NOT TAKING IT
LIKE IT'S A VACATION.

120
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:21,655
I'VE BEEN KEEPING UP
IN MY TEXTBOOKS.

121
00:05:22,739 --> 00:05:23,448
YOU WERE SUPPOSED
TO RETURN THOSE.

122
00:05:24,491 --> 00:05:26,201
BUT I NEED THEM
TO WRITE EXAMS.

123
00:05:27,786 --> 00:05:29,037
YOU DON'T GET
TO DO THAT.

124
00:05:31,582 --> 00:05:32,374
SO THAT'S IT?

125
00:05:32,457 --> 00:05:33,709
I JUST LOSE MY YEAR?

126
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:38,839
I'M WILLING TO OFFER
SUMMER SCHOOL.

127
00:05:39,715 --> 00:05:42,593
BUT THAT ONLY GIVES ME
TWO CREDITS

128
00:05:43,093 --> 00:05:44,261
THAT'S NOT EVEN
ENOUGH TO GRADUATE.

129
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:46,054
I MEAN, THAT'S A WHOLE YEAR
OF MY LIFE

130
00:05:46,138 --> 00:05:47,181
I'LL HAVE TO DO OVER.

131
00:05:47,264 --> 00:05:48,515
THAT'S NOT FAIR.

132
00:05:48,599 --> 00:05:50,517
WHAT ISN'T FAIR IS
THAT RICK MURRAY IS DEAD

133
00:05:50,601 --> 00:05:52,352
AS AN INDIRECT RESULT
OF YOUR BULLYING.

134
00:05:54,271 --> 00:05:57,441
I NEED TO FINISH
MY YEAR, MS. H.

135
00:05:58,358 --> 00:05:59,109
NO.

136
00:06:09,036 --> 00:06:09,536
DYLAN?

137
00:06:10,537 --> 00:06:11,413
HEY! IT'S ME.

138
00:06:11,496 --> 00:06:12,956
LOOK, JUST PLEASE
CALL ME.

139
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,625
WHENEVER.
I'M HERE.

140
00:06:16,335 --> 00:06:18,587
CRAIG:
WHY'S YOUR BLOOD
ANY MORE RISKY THAN OURS?

141
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:20,005
ELLIE:
DON'T THEY TEST
EVERYTHING ANYWAY?

142
00:06:20,088 --> 00:06:22,299
THERE'S NOTHING WRONG
WITH ME.

143
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:23,091
I'VE ONLY BEEN WITH DYLAN,

144
00:06:23,175 --> 00:06:24,301
HE'S ONLY BEEN WITH ME.

145
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:25,928
EVEN THEN,
WE WERE TOTALLY SAFE.

146
00:06:26,803 --> 00:06:28,096
SO STOP WHINING;

147
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:29,681
START COMPLAINING.

148
00:06:30,224 --> 00:06:31,391
THERE'S YOUR SOAPBOX.

149
00:06:31,475 --> 00:06:32,100
USE IT.

150
00:06:38,982 --> 00:06:39,566
CAITLIN?

151
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:40,484
HEY.

152
00:06:40,567 --> 00:06:41,401
HEY.

153
00:06:42,069 --> 00:06:43,987
HOW'S THIS FOR A STORY?

154
00:06:44,071 --> 00:06:45,864
PREJUDICE AND HOMOPHOBIA
AT LOCAL HIGH SCHOOL.

155
00:06:48,909 --> 00:06:49,826
I'D SAY
WE'RE ON YOU.

156
00:06:53,747 --> 00:06:54,706
MARCO:
NURSE DAVIS?

157
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:55,249
HEY.

158
00:06:55,332 --> 00:06:55,916
YEAH.

159
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:56,583
MARCO:
HI.

160
00:06:56,667 --> 00:06:57,417
HI.

161
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:02,297
LOOK,
I WANT TO ASK WHY

162
00:07:02,381 --> 00:07:04,174
WHY BLOOD MANAGEMENT
REFUSES GAY PEOPLE

163
00:07:04,258 --> 00:07:04,800
FROM GIVING BLOOD.

164
00:07:06,927 --> 00:07:07,761
DAVIS:
UM...

165
00:07:09,888 --> 00:07:11,890
WELL, IT'S POLICY.

166
00:07:13,851 --> 00:07:14,601
I'M NOT A SPOKESPERSON

167
00:07:14,685 --> 00:07:16,311
SO I CAN'T REALLY
COMMENT FURTHER.

168
00:07:16,395 --> 00:07:17,354
FINE.

169
00:07:20,858 --> 00:07:22,109
MY NAME'S MARCO DEL ROSSI,

170
00:07:22,192 --> 00:07:24,236
STUDENT COUNCIL PRESIDENT.

171
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:26,280
TODAY, A STUDENT WAS DENIED
AS A BLOOD DONOR

172
00:07:26,363 --> 00:07:28,574
BECAUSE OF HIS SEXUALITY.

173
00:07:28,657 --> 00:07:29,741
EXCUSE ME,
THAT'S NOT THE REASON.

174
00:07:29,825 --> 00:07:30,367
MARCO:
THEN WHAT IS?

175
00:07:30,701 --> 00:07:31,660
WELL...

176
00:07:32,619 --> 00:07:36,290
THERE IS UM...
WITHIN THE GAY COMMUNITY,

177
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:41,295
THERE IS AN INCREASED RISK

00:15:54,162 --> 00:15:57,833
YOU'RE A FREAK
THE SAME WAY THAT I AM.

355
00:15:58,792 --> 00:16:01,086
YEAH? WELL, AT LEAST I'M NOT
TORCHING THE SCHOOL.

356
00:16:04,423 --> 00:16:06,300
(STRUGGLING AND GRUNTING)

357
00:16:07,968 --> 00:16:09,511
DO YOU WANT YOUR
FORMER FRIENDS TO SUFFER?

358
00:16:09,595 --> 00:16:11,221
HUH, DO YOU?

359
00:16:11,305 --> 00:16:12,723
I WANT THEM BACK!

360
00:16:14,975 --> 00:16:16,226
JAY:
LISTEN,

361
00:16:16,310 --> 00:16:17,603
AS YOUR FRIEND SUBSTITUTE,

362
00:16:17,686 --> 00:16:19,646
I'M TELLING YOU,

363
00:16:20,731 --> 00:16:22,900
THIS ISN'T THE WAY.

364
00:16:22,983 --> 00:16:24,276
IT'S NOT.

365
00:16:26,486 --> 00:16:28,322
I JUST WANT THEM BACK.

366
00:16:40,459 --> 00:16:41,251
COME ON, MAN,

367
00:16:41,335 --> 00:16:42,336
WE GOT TO CLEAN THIS UP.

368
00:16:49,551 --> 00:16:52,012
YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU ARE A GREAT GUY.

369
00:16:52,513 --> 00:16:54,765
THE MOST HONEST,
DOWN-TO-EARTH,

370
00:16:54,848 --> 00:16:57,768
NICEST PERSON
THAT I KNOW.

371
00:16:57,851 --> 00:16:59,102
YOU'RE A LITTLE SHORT,

372
00:16:59,186 --> 00:17:02,481
BUT THAT JUST ADDS
TO THE CUTENESS...

373
00:17:02,564 --> 00:17:04,775
THAT I WOULD FIND YOU
TO BE...

374
00:17:04,858 --> 00:17:06,235
IF YOU WERE A GIRL

375
00:17:06,318 --> 00:17:08,362
OR I WAS NOT A GUY...

376
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:11,615
WHO IS NOT GAY.

377
00:17:11,698 --> 00:17:13,784
JUST TELL ME
THIS IS HELPING.

378
00:17:13,867 --> 00:17:16,119
YOU'RE TELLING ME
WHAT I REALLY WANT TO HEAR.

379
00:17:16,203 --> 00:17:19,122
I APPRECIATE IT.
THANKS .

380
00:17:19,206 --> 00:17:21,375
IF YOU WANT TO HELP?

381
00:17:22,084 --> 00:17:24,670
TELL ME I'M AN IDIOT.

382
00:17:24,753 --> 00:17:26,463
YOU'RE AN IDIOT?

383
00:17:26,547 --> 00:17:28,841
I CAN'T GO DOWNSTAIRS.

384
00:17:28,924 --> 00:17:29,925
I CAN'T STAY HERE.

385
00:17:30,008 --> 00:17:31,635
I CAN'T TALK TO DYLAN.
WHAT DO I DO?

386
00:17:31,718 --> 00:17:33,387
DYLAN:
MARCO?

387
00:17:35,848 --> 00:17:37,015
I UM... WOW.

388
00:17:42,104 --> 00:17:44,648
SO WHEN IN DOUBT,
YOU KISS CRAIG?

389
00:17:44,731 --> 00:17:46,024
I GOTTA SETTLE
THIS WITH DYLAN.

390
00:17:46,108 --> 00:17:47,150
YEAH. YOU DO.

391
00:17:47,234 --> 00:17:49,570
YOU REALLY,
REALLY DO.

392
00:18:01,957 --> 00:18:03,750
I LOVE YOU.

393
00:18:03,834 --> 00:18:05,335
LIKEWISE.
BUT WHAT WAS THAT?

394
00:18:05,419 --> 00:18:06,837
DYLAN?

395
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:09,506
A LOT OF THINGS AREN'T
MAKING SENSE RIGHT NOW.

396
00:18:09,590 --> 00:18:12,009
SO WHAT DO YOU
WANT ME TO SAY?

397
00:18:12,092 --> 00:18:13,010
THAT IT MADE
YOU JEALOUS?

398
00:18:13,093 --> 00:18:14,720
IT WAS CRAIG.

399
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:19,433
I DON'T WANT YOU
TO SEE OTHER PEOPLE.

400
00:18:19,516 --> 00:18:21,185
I DON'T LIKE IT.

401
00:18:21,268 --> 00:18:22,311
AND I'M NOT GONNA LIKE IT

402
00:18:22,394 --> 00:18:24,229
AND I'M NOT GONNA FEEL BAD
THAT IT BUGS ME.

403
00:18:24,313 --> 00:18:24,688
IT BUGS YOU?

404
00:18:24,771 --> 00:18:25,147
IT BUGS ME!

405
00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:26,690
IT DOESN'T
HAVE TO, OKAY?

406
00:18:26,773 --> 00:18:27,357
HOW I FEEL ABOUT YOU

407
00:18:27,441 --> 00:18:28,358
THIS CHANGES
NONE OF THAT.

408
00:18:28,442 --> 00:18:29,693
THAT'S FINE
AND OKAY,

409
00:18:29,776 --> 00:18:30,569
BUT YOU SEE,

410
00:18:30,652 --> 00:18:33,739
IT CHANGES
HOW I FEEL ABOUT ME.

411
00:18:34,531 --> 00:18:36,033
MY FREEDOM,

412
00:18:37,159 --> 00:18:40,704
THAT'S IMPORTANT
TO ME RIGHT NOW.

413
00:18:40,787 --> 00:18:43,040
I CAN'T GIVE THAT UP.

414
00:18:43,957 --> 00:18:45,375
THEN YOU AND ME?

415
00:18:45,459 --> 00:18:46,710
I CAN'T.

416
00:18:47,753 --> 00:18:49,421
AND IT'S OVER.

417
00:18:57,554 --> 00:18:58,138
♪ GOODBYE ♪

418
00:19:02,434 --> 00:19:03,685
♪ MADE UP MY MIND ♪

419
00:19:07,147 --> 00:19:08,398
♪ OH, OH, GOODBYE ♪

420
00:19:20,452 --> 00:19:21,370
MS. H?

421
00:19:22,788 --> 00:19:25,749
GAVIN, I DON'T HAVE
TIME TO ARGUE.

422
00:19:25,832 --> 00:19:27,793
YOU MENTIONED
SUMMER SCHOOL.

423
00:19:27,876 --> 00:19:30,629
I OFFERED,
YOU DECLINED.

424
00:19:32,089 --> 00:19:34,049
THEN WHAT IF I TAKE IT
AT ANOTHER SCHOOL

425
00:19:34,132 --> 00:19:35,551
OR BY CORRESPONDENCE,

426
00:19:35,634 --> 00:19:37,386
AND MAKE THE CREDITS UP
THAT WAY?

427
00:19:37,469 --> 00:19:40,305
COULD I COME BACK
NEXT FALL?

428
00:19:44,518 --> 00:19:46,979
THERE ARE TWO THINGS
THAT I WANT:

429
00:19:47,062 --> 00:19:50,023
TO FINISH SCHOOL
AND TO GET MY FRIENDS BACK.

430
00:19:50,107 --> 00:19:53,819
BUT SOMEONE'S GOT
TO GIVE ME A CHANCE.

431
00:19:54,862 --> 00:19:55,946
PLEASE?

432
00:20:05,622 --> 00:20:07,082
HATZILAKOS:
HERE ARE THE FORMS

433
00:20:07,165 --> 00:20:08,250
AND THE SUMMER SCHEDULE -

434
00:20:08,333 --> 00:20:10,419
A.K.A YOUR CHANCE.

435
00:20:10,919 --> 00:20:12,004
GAVIN?

436
00:20:13,046 --> 00:20:14,214
DON'T SCREW IT UP.

437
00:20:27,436 --> 00:20:28,687
UM, OKAY.

438
00:20:30,189 --> 00:20:30,856
HEY, MARCO.

439
00:20:30,939 --> 00:20:31,940
HEY.

440
00:20:32,024 --> 00:20:35,194
SO THE BLOOD DRIVE,
IT WAS A HUGE SUCCESS.

441
00:20:35,277 --> 00:20:36,737
THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR COVERING IT.

442
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:37,946
OH,
MY PLEASURE.

443
00:20:38,030 --> 00:20:39,740
I JUST HAD A QUESTION,

444
00:20:39,823 --> 00:20:42,117
ABOUT THE SCENE
I STARTED IN THE GYM?

445
00:20:42,201 --> 00:20:46,079
ARE YOU GONNA AIR THAT
AT A DIFFERENT TIME OR...?

446
00:20:46,163 --> 00:20:47,289
ACTUALLY,
SOME PEOPLE HERE

447
00:20:47,372 --> 00:20:49,750
WOULD RATHER BURY
THAT PART OF IT.

448
00:20:49,833 --> 00:20:51,084
OH. OKAY.

449
00:20:52,377 --> 00:20:54,671
UH NO, IT'S NOT OKAY,
ACTUALLY.

450
00:20:54,755 --> 00:20:56,131
I'M SICK OF SEEING
AIDS VIEWED

451
00:20:56,215 --> 00:20:58,675
SOLELY AS A HOMOSEXUAL
DISEASE.

452
00:20:58,759 --> 00:21:00,844
I'VE TRIED DOING SOMETHING
ABOUT IT BEFORE.

453
00:21:00,928 --> 00:21:02,971
LAST YEAR
I EVEN WENT TO AFRICA.

454
00:21:03,055 --> 00:21:04,890
ONE WORD:
EDUCATING.

455
00:21:04,973 --> 00:21:07,017
YOU KNOW, IF YOU'RE INTERESTED
IN VOLUNTEERING,

456
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:09,603
I'VE GOT SOME FRIENDS
WE COULD TALK TO.

457
00:21:09,686 --> 00:21:11,605
YEAH,
SURE I'M INTERESTED.

458
00:21:11,688 --> 00:21:12,314
INTERESTED ENOUGH

459
00:21:12,397 --> 00:21:14,608
IN SPENDING SOME TIME
IN AFRICA

460
00:21:14,691 --> 00:21:16,235
OR THE CARIBBEAN?

461
00:21:16,318 --> 00:21:17,402
YEAH!

462
00:21:17,486 --> 00:21:19,321
YEAH, OF COURSE.

463
00:21:19,404 --> 00:21:20,447
IT WOULD MEAN

464
00:21:20,531 --> 00:21:22,491
GIVING UP YOUR
ENTIRE SUMMER.

465
00:21:22,574 --> 00:21:24,660
ANY BIG PLANS?

466
00:21:24,743 --> 00:21:26,745
I DID...
HAVE SOME.

467
00:21:28,872 --> 00:21:31,667
BUT YOU KNOW
HOW IT IS WITH PLANS.

468
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:33,377
THEY CHANGE.
