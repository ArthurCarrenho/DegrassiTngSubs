00:00:01,585 --> 00:00:02,753
SHELLY ON TV:
AND GOOD MORNING TO YOU,
BOBBY.

2
00:00:02,836 --> 00:00:05,088
I'M HERE WITH PEARL PINKTON.

3
00:00:05,172 --> 00:00:08,091
PEARL, YOU'RE AN ERASER
CONNOISSEUR.

4
00:00:09,134 --> 00:00:10,093
SEAN.

5
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:12,638
SEAN.

6
00:00:17,559 --> 00:00:18,602
OH, WOW.

7
00:00:19,436 --> 00:00:21,146
DOUBLE WOW.
I'M LATE.

8
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:22,564
"HOME BY ELEVEN"
DOES NOT MEAN A.M.

9
00:00:22,648 --> 00:00:23,649
DID YOU TURN THE RINGER OFF?

10
00:00:26,401 --> 00:00:27,694
I NEED A CAB.

11
00:00:27,778 --> 00:00:30,030
I NEED TEN DOLLARS
TO PAY FOR A CAB.

12
00:00:30,113 --> 00:00:32,199
RINGER'S ON.
NOBODY'S CALLED.

13
00:00:32,282 --> 00:00:34,660
ELLIE:
MY MOM PROBABLY LOST
YOUR NUMBER.

14
00:00:34,743 --> 00:00:37,120
OR FELL ASLEEP WATCHING
THE SAME LAME MOVIE WE DID.

15
00:00:38,121 --> 00:00:39,915
SNUGGLING UP
WITH A FEW EMPTY BOTTLES.

16
00:00:40,666 --> 00:00:41,792
I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT THIS.

17
00:00:42,668 --> 00:00:44,378
YOU KNOW,
YOU'RE WELCOME HERE.

18
00:00:44,461 --> 00:00:46,004
LET'S SEE
IF I'M EVEN ALLOWED BACK.

19
00:00:46,296 --> 00:00:47,673
I MEANT TO STAY.

20
00:00:51,969 --> 00:00:53,637
YEAH.

WHAT, YOU JUST FORGOT

33
00:01:44,855 --> 00:01:45,731
ASHLEY:
LEFT MINE AT MY MOM'S

34
00:01:45,814 --> 00:01:47,608
DIDN'T WANT TO USE MY DAD'S
"SPORT SCENT"

35
00:01:47,691 --> 00:01:49,193
OR HIS BOYFRIEND'S
"MOUNTAIN ICE."

36
00:01:49,276 --> 00:01:50,777
ELLIE:
MEN'S DEODORANT
GIVES ME A RASH.

37
00:01:50,861 --> 00:01:52,446
ASHLEY:
YEAH, WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE
GIVES ME A RASH

38
00:01:52,529 --> 00:01:53,697
IS THAT MY DAD IS BRINGING
HIS BOYFRIEND

39
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:55,324
TO THE OPEN HOUSE TODAY.

40
00:01:55,407 --> 00:01:56,450
IMAGINE THE RASH I GOT

41
00:01:56,533 --> 00:01:58,410
WHEN SEAN ASKED ME
TO MOVE IN.

42
00:01:58,493 --> 00:01:59,536
THIS MORNING.

43
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:00,537
WHAT?

44
00:02:01,330 --> 00:02:03,665
MOVE IN, CO-HABITATE,
LIVE IN SIN.

45
00:02:04,249 --> 00:02:05,083
YOU CAN'T!

46
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:08,128
MY MOM ISN'T DOING
SO WELL.

47
00:02:08,212 --> 00:02:10,047
IT'S PRETTY BAD.

48
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:11,006
AND HOW IS SEAN?

49
00:02:14,259 --> 00:02:15,177
WELL, IS IT GOOD ENOUGH

50
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:18,555
TO RISK GIVING YOUR MOM
A HEART ATTACK?

51
00:02:24,061 --> 00:02:26,188
MANNY:
HEY, SPINNER.

52
00:02:26,271 --> 00:02:27,773
WHY, IT'S NICE TO SEE YOU TOO,
MANNY.

53
00:02:27,856 --> 00:02:29,691
HAVE A GOOD DAY.

54
00:02:30,484 --> 00:02:32,319
HEY, YOU WANT TO EARN SOME
MAJOR POINTS

55
00:02:32,402 --> 00:02:34,571
BY HELPING WITH PAIGE'S
SPIRIT SQUAD CAR WASH?

56
00:02:34,655 --> 00:02:37,366
PAIGE SORT OF OWES ME
THE MAJOR POINTS THESE DAYS.

57
00:02:38,617 --> 00:02:39,284
MANNY:
OKAY.

58
00:02:39,368 --> 00:02:42,412
SO WHY NOT EARN MAJOR POINTS
WITH ME THEN?

59
00:02:42,496 --> 00:02:44,081
PAIGE IS OFF SICK,
WITH THE FLU.

60
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:45,874
YEAH. I KNOW.

61
00:02:45,958 --> 00:02:47,000
SO I'M IN CHARGE.

62
00:02:47,084 --> 00:02:48,836
AND HONESTLY?
I NEED HELP.

63
00:02:48,919 --> 00:02:50,087
WE NEED TO EARN
A LOT OF MONEY

64
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:52,005
TO GET THOSE
NEW UNIFORMS.

65
00:02:52,089 --> 00:02:53,549
SO YOU THINK
IT WOULD HELP

66
00:02:53,632 --> 00:02:55,759
IF I WASHED CARS
IN MY WET T-SHIRT?

67
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:59,596
NO, I WANT YOU TO PLAY
WITH YOUR BAND, YOU IDIOT.

68
00:03:00,889 --> 00:03:03,058
NO. YOU GUYS WOULD ATTRACT
SO MUCH ATTENTION.

69
00:03:04,226 --> 00:03:05,853
YEAH, BUT THE SQUATCH
ISN'T MY BAND.

70
00:03:05,936 --> 00:03:07,020
YOU'D HAVE TO ASK-

71
00:03:07,104 --> 00:03:08,188
CRAIG.

72
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:12,109
YEAH. THAT'D BE
JUST A BIT AWKWARD.

73
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:18,323
PLEASE, PLEASE,
PLEASE, PLEASE.

74
00:03:18,407 --> 00:03:21,159
WITH KETCHUP AND GRAVY
AND BIG HUGE HUGS ON TOP?

75
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:22,661
GRAVY?

76
00:03:23,328 --> 00:03:24,288
YEAH, I'LL SEE
WHAT I CAN DO.

77
00:03:25,122 --> 00:03:26,707
OKAY, THANKS.

78
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:32,421
OH. AND GET CRAIG
TO BRING HIS CAMERA, 'KAY?

79
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:34,298
'KAY!

80
00:03:37,467 --> 00:03:38,177
WHY NOT?

81
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:40,554
MY DAD'S GOT
SIX MONTHS OF SERVICE.

82
00:03:40,637 --> 00:03:41,638
SO THAT'S SIX MONTHS
OF HOMEWORK .

83
00:03:41,722 --> 00:03:43,640
THAT'S SIX MONTHS
OF DINNERS.

84
00:03:43,724 --> 00:03:45,767
HE'S IN THE MIDDLE EAST,
SEAN.

85
00:03:45,851 --> 00:03:47,686
IF THE CALL CAME IN
HE WAS HURT, OR WORSE,

86
00:03:47,769 --> 00:03:48,228
MY MOM WOULD-

87
00:03:48,312 --> 00:03:48,812
SHE WOULD WHAT?

88
00:03:48,896 --> 00:03:50,022
SHE WOULD CRACK OPEN
HER THIRD BOTTLE

89
00:03:50,105 --> 00:03:52,399
FOR THE EVENING?

90
00:03:52,482 --> 00:03:54,401
WE CAN DO DINNERS, OKAY?

91
00:03:54,484 --> 00:03:56,820
MAYBE WATCH SOME CRAPPY TV,
BUT AFTER THAT?

92
00:03:59,948 --> 00:04:01,700
LET ME MAKE IT SIMPLE.

93
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:06,330
MOVE IN WITH SOMEONE
WHO LOVES YOU.

94
00:04:13,629 --> 00:04:14,463
I'M SORRY.

95
00:04:16,507 --> 00:04:17,591
SHE NEEDS ME.

96
00:04:25,349 --> 00:04:27,184
IT'S FINISHED.

97
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:28,644
NO ONE CARES ABOUT
AUTO SHOP ANYWAYS.

98
00:04:48,956 --> 00:04:50,874
NO, EMMA'S DOING PRETTY WELL.

99
00:04:50,958 --> 00:04:52,793
POLYNOMIALS CAN BE
A BIT OF A STRUGGLE.

100
00:04:52,876 --> 00:04:55,379
ME AND MATH?
MORTAL ENEMIES.

101
00:04:55,462 --> 00:04:57,297
YOU BALANCE YOUR OWN BOOKS
AT THE SALON.

102
00:04:57,381 --> 00:04:58,465
DON'T BELIEVE HER.

103
00:04:58,549 --> 00:05:02,135
MRS. NASH:
ELLIE MUST LOVE YOUR CLASS.
ALL HER CLASSES.

104
00:05:02,219 --> 00:05:03,637
SHE SPENDS ALMOST EVERY NIGHT
AT HER BOYFRIEND'S

105
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:04,471
DOING HOMEWORK.

106
00:05:05,806 --> 00:05:07,808
WELL, MEDIA IMMERSION
IS VERY INTENSE.

107
00:05:07,891 --> 00:05:08,851
THE COURSE IS CENTRED ON-

108
00:05:08,934 --> 00:05:11,478
MEDIA. COMPUTERS.
YEAH, I GET IT.

109
00:05:11,562 --> 00:05:13,772
TELL ME, DO YOU ASSIGN
EVERY PROJECT IN PAIRS?

110
00:05:15,357 --> 00:05:16,108
WELL, NO.

111
00:05:16,191 --> 00:05:17,401
IN FACT,
MOST OF THE WORK IS-

112
00:05:17,484 --> 00:05:18,902
THOUGHT SO.

113
00:05:19,486 --> 00:05:21,363
WELL, THANKS YOU VERY MUCH,
MR. STANTON.

114
00:05:21,446 --> 00:05:22,197
IT'S SIMPSON.

115
00:05:23,532 --> 00:05:25,075
(LAUGHS)
LIKE THE CARTOON.

116
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:27,077
THAT'S PRICELESS.

117
00:05:35,085 --> 00:05:35,460
ASHLEY:
ELLIE.

118
00:05:35,544 --> 00:05:36,461
ELLIE:
HEY MOM?

119
00:05:36,545 --> 00:05:38,213
YOU REMEMBER ASHLEY?

120
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:41,508
MRS. NASH,
THIS IS MY FATHER, ROBERT,

121
00:05:41,592 --> 00:05:42,843
AND HIS PARTNER.

122
00:05:42,926 --> 00:05:44,845
CHRISTOPHER:
HI, I'M CHRISTOPHER.

123
00:05:44,928 --> 00:05:46,346
PARTNERS, HUH?

124
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:47,806
DO YOU RUN
A BUSINESS TOGETHER?

125
00:05:47,890 --> 00:05:50,517
OR IS IT PAIRS
FIGURE SKATING?

126
00:05:50,601 --> 00:05:52,477
ROBERT:
WE'RE LIFE PARTNERS,
ACTUALLY.

127
00:05:52,561 --> 00:05:54,062
OH, I KNOW.

128
00:05:54,146 --> 00:05:57,107
MUST BE NICE,
HAVING A MAN AROUND.

129
00:05:57,191 --> 00:05:58,817
MY HUSBAND IS OFF
FIGHTING FOR HIS COUNTRY.

130
00:05:59,693 --> 00:06:00,861
ROBERT:
THAT MUST BE DIFFICULT
FOR YOU AND ELLIE.

131
00:06:01,486 --> 00:06:03,530
MRS. NASH:
YOU HAVE NO IDEA.

132
00:06:03,614 --> 00:06:06,700
OR DO THEY LET YOU PEOPLE
IN THE MILITARY NOW?

133
00:06:06,783 --> 00:06:10,162
YOU RE-DECORATE THE ENEMY
INTO SURRENDERING.

134
00:06:11,288 --> 00:06:12,539
(FAKE LAUGHTER)

135
00:06:13,749 --> 00:06:16,043
ELLIE:
MOM, YOU'RE TIRED.
WE SHOULD GO.

136
00:06:16,126 --> 00:06:16,460
BYE.

137
00:06:22,216 --> 00:06:24,009
MRS. NASH:
OH, WAIT. ISN'T THAT
YOUR BOYFRIEND?

138
00:06:24,092 --> 00:06:26,011
ELLIE:
IT'S OKAY.
I'LL CALL HIM LATER.

139
00:06:26,094 --> 00:06:27,221
SEAN, ISN'T?

140
00:06:27,304 --> 00:06:28,430
I WAS HOPING TO SEE YOU.

141
00:06:28,514 --> 00:06:30,724
AH, NICE TO SEE YOU TOO,
MRS. NASH.

142
00:06:30,807 --> 00:06:32,059
MRS. NASH:
YOUR PARENTS?

143
00:06:32,142 --> 00:06:34,603
THEY'RE NOT HERE TO SEE THIS
FINE AUTOMOTIVE DISPLAY?

144
00:06:37,189 --> 00:06:39,233
I'M ALONE.
I LIVE ALONE.

145
00:06:39,316 --> 00:06:40,567
NOT LATELY.

146
00:06:40,651 --> 00:06:41,401
MOM...

147
00:06:41,485 --> 00:06:44,613
MIDNIGHT STUDY SESSIONS,
DAWN TUTORIALS.

148
00:06:44,696 --> 00:06:46,698
SOMETIMES I CAN'T REMEMBER
WHAT ELLIE LOOKS LIKE.

149
00:06:47,699 --> 00:06:49,409
ELLIE:
MOM. LET'S GO.

150
00:06:49,493 --> 00:06:50,577
SEAN:
LOOK, I-

151
00:06:51,328 --> 00:06:53,705
I CARE ABOUT HER,
OKAY?

152
00:06:54,373 --> 00:06:55,666
NOT OKAY.

153
00:07:01,505 --> 00:07:02,798
CRAIG:
ONE, TWO, THREE, FOUR.

154
00:07:02,881 --> 00:07:10,472
♪♪♪

155
00:07:10,556 --> 00:07:11,598
CRAIG:
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA!

156
00:07:11,682 --> 00:07:14,101
YOU'RE COMING IN
WAY TOO EARLY!

157
00:07:14,184 --> 00:07:15,769
SPINNER:
DUDE, HOW ARE WE SUPPOSED
TO GET BETTER

158
00:07:15,853 --> 00:07:16,937
IF ALL WE DO IS REHEARSE?

159
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:20,107
I MEAN, WE SHOULD PLAY
ANOTHER GIG.

160
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:20,941
WELL, WE WILL

161
00:07:21,024 --> 00:07:22,401
WHEN WE'RE SMOKIN' HOT.

162
00:07:22,484 --> 00:07:24,528
IN THE 23RD CENTURY.

163
00:07:24,611 --> 00:07:25,404
SPINNER:
EXACTLY.

164
00:07:25,487 --> 00:07:28,490
WE NEED PLAY SMALLER GIGS
TO STOKE US UP TO SMOKIN' HOT.

165
00:07:29,116 --> 00:07:30,075
SPINNER
HAS A POINT.

166
00:07:30,158 --> 00:07:30,868
WHO ASKED YOU?

167
00:07:32,536 --> 00:07:34,872
I MEAN, YEAH.
WHAT SHE SAID.

168
00:07:35,706 --> 00:07:36,206
SORRY.

169
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:39,418
ALL RIGHT. WELL,
I GUESS WE COULD PUT

170
00:07:39,501 --> 00:07:40,794
A LITTLE MORE PRESSURE
ON OURSELVES.

171
00:07:40,878 --> 00:07:42,004
YES!

172
00:07:42,087 --> 00:07:43,297
THAT'S WHY I BOOKED US

173
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:46,008
FOR THE SCHOOL SPIRIT SQUAD
CAR WASH THIS WEEKEND.

174
00:07:47,217 --> 00:07:48,051
WHAT?

175
00:07:48,135 --> 00:07:50,053
WHOA, SPIN!
WE'RE NOT READY.

176
00:07:50,137 --> 00:07:51,263
DUDE, IT'S A CAR WASH.

177
00:07:51,346 --> 00:07:53,223
WE'RE NOT OPENING FOR
KID ELRICK AT THE DOME.

178
00:07:54,308 --> 00:07:55,851
ALL RIGHT,
WE'LL TAKE IT TO A VOTE.

179
00:07:55,934 --> 00:07:57,269
ALL FOR THE GIG?

180
00:07:58,103 --> 00:08:00,189
JIMMY:
ALL AGAINST?

181
00:08:01,106 --> 00:08:03,442
SPINNER:
OKAY. WELL, THREE TO TWO,
MAJORITY RULES.

182
00:08:03,525 --> 00:08:04,234
MANNY'LL BE STOKED!

183
00:08:05,152 --> 00:08:06,403
ASHLEY AND CRAIG:
MANNY?

184
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:09,573
JIMMY:
SPEAKING OF SMOKIN' HOT.

185
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:15,954
(FIRE ALARM BEEPS)

186
00:08:16,914 --> 00:08:17,581
(SNIFFS)

187
00:08:23,253 --> 00:08:23,837
(SMOKE ALARM)

188
00:08:23,921 --> 00:08:24,755
(COUGHING)

189
00:08:32,221 --> 00:08:32,554
MOM!

190
00:08:33,055 --> 00:08:34,056
MOM! GET UP!

191
00:08:34,848 --> 00:08:35,432
GET UP!

192
00:08:39,394 --> 00:08:40,395
MOM! GET UP!

193
00:08:56,245 --> 00:08:57,079
(COUGHING)

194
00:08:58,288 --> 00:08:59,581
MOM! GET UP!

195
00:08:59,665 --> 00:09:00,415
MOM! MOM!

196
00:09:14,221 --> 00:09:16,557
I MUST'VE TAKEN IN A LIFE'S
SUPPLY OF SMOKE TONIGHT.

197
00:09:22,646 --> 00:09:24,565
I'M NOT PROUD RIGHT NOW,
ELLIE.

198
00:09:24,648 --> 00:09:26,608
I ALMOST BURNT
THE PLACE DOWN.

199
00:09:26,692 --> 00:09:27,776
DON'T MAKE THIS
ANY WORSE FOR ME.

200
00:09:28,944 --> 00:09:31,238
I'M EXHAUSTED.
I HAVE TO SLEEP.

201
00:09:32,281 --> 00:09:33,907
FINE. THERE'S A FOLD-OUT
AT ELAINE'S.

202
00:09:33,991 --> 00:09:34,741
ELAINE'S?

203
00:09:35,659 --> 00:09:37,828
SHE LIVES IN FERGUS.
WHY DO I HAVE TO GO THERE?

204
00:09:37,911 --> 00:09:39,872
BECAUSE I'M STILL YOUR MOTHER,
AND I SAID SO.

205
00:09:42,124 --> 00:09:42,624
OKAY.

206
00:09:49,423 --> 00:09:53,260
BUT WHAT IF I STAY OVER
AT ASHLEY'S INSTEAD,

207
00:09:54,219 --> 00:09:55,095
IN THE CITY?

208
00:09:55,179 --> 00:09:57,181
WELL, I WOULDN'T HAVE TO DRIVE
YOU IN TO SCHOOL EVERY DAY.

209
00:09:58,015 --> 00:10:00,350
EXACTLY WHAT I WAS THINKING.

210
00:10:01,435 --> 00:10:02,352
BUT IT'S UP TO YOU.

211
00:10:03,145 --> 00:10:04,938
WHATEVER YOU WANT.

212
00:10:05,022 --> 00:10:06,523
WELL, IF IT'S ALL RIGHT
WITH ASHLEY'S MOTHER

213
00:10:06,607 --> 00:10:07,733
IT'S ALL RIGHT WITH ME.

214
00:10:07,816 --> 00:10:09,151
AT LEAST UNTIL OUR PLACE
IS READY.

215
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:11,862
I'LL GO CALL ASHLEY RIGHT NOW.

216
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:18,744
(GROAN)

217
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:29,755
YESTERDAY, YOU MIGHT HAVE
MENTIONED THE WORDS "MOVE IN".

218
00:10:34,927 --> 00:10:36,929
ELLIE:
HOME SWEET HOME.

219
00:10:37,012 --> 00:10:38,680
SEAN:
MY CLOTHES STINK
AFTER BEING AT YOUR PLACE.

220
00:10:44,728 --> 00:10:46,146
LOOKS LIKE MY CD COLLECTION
JUST DOUBLED.

221
00:10:51,109 --> 00:10:54,112
ELLIE:
I WAS THINKING,
WE NEED A PET.

222
00:10:54,196 --> 00:10:56,448
A DOG,
OR A PARROT, OR A-

223
00:10:56,532 --> 00:10:57,533
I THOUGHT
YOU STOPPED CUTTING.

224
00:10:58,700 --> 00:10:59,201
I DID.

225
00:11:00,035 --> 00:11:01,537
I JUST DIDN'T WANT
TO LEAVE IT THERE.

226
00:11:07,292 --> 00:11:08,794
I WOULDN'T LIE TO YOU
ABOUT THIS.

227
00:11:11,129 --> 00:11:12,130
I CLEARED A DRAWER.

228
00:11:16,218 --> 00:11:17,219
YOU DID?

229
00:11:17,302 --> 00:11:17,928
SEAN:
YEAH.

230
00:11:18,929 --> 00:11:20,305
AND SOME SPACE IN THE CLOSET

231
00:11:20,389 --> 00:11:22,975
AND IN THE MEDICINE CABINET
JUST ABOVE THE SINK.

232
00:11:25,143 --> 00:11:27,312
LISTEN, THERE'S SOMETHING
WE SHOULD-

233
00:11:27,396 --> 00:11:28,564
I KNOW.

234
00:11:29,189 --> 00:11:31,358
AND IT'S FINE.
I'LL JUST SLEEP ON THE COUCH.

235
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:33,402
YOU HAVE A BED.

236
00:11:33,485 --> 00:11:35,487
YOU JUST HAD A FIRE.

237
00:11:35,571 --> 00:11:37,406
SO FOR NOW, I'LL JUST SLEEP
ON THE COUCH, OKAY?

238
00:11:53,964 --> 00:11:55,841
SPINNER,
I SAID STOP IT!

239
00:11:55,924 --> 00:11:57,676
WHAT? IT WASN'T ME.

240
00:11:57,759 --> 00:11:58,427
NEW GIRL.

241
00:11:59,011 --> 00:11:59,845
NEW GIRL?

242
00:11:59,928 --> 00:12:01,138
I PREFER DARCY,
THANKS.

243
00:12:01,763 --> 00:12:03,098
OH. OKAY, DARCY.

244
00:12:10,564 --> 00:12:11,857
HEY CRAIG.

245
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:14,359
THANKS FOR DOING THIS.
IT'S REALLY GREAT.

246
00:12:14,443 --> 00:12:16,278
ANY TIME, MANNY.

247
00:12:16,862 --> 00:12:17,654
ASHLEY:
CHECK, ONE, TWO.

248
00:12:17,738 --> 00:12:19,114
DO WE HAVE CRAIG MANNING
IN THE HOUSE?

249
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:28,123
ANY MORE BITTER
AND SHE'D BE A LEMON.

250
00:12:36,715 --> 00:12:37,674
HEY, YOU THINK
THAT'S FUNNY, RIGHT?

251
00:12:38,467 --> 00:12:39,801
OH NO! NO!

252
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:46,558
I HATE YOU!

253
00:12:50,479 --> 00:12:51,730
BUT YOU'RE ALL RIGHT,
RIGHT?

254
00:12:51,813 --> 00:12:53,607
I MEAN, AFTER BREATHING IN
ALL THAT SMOKE?

255
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:55,734
I DON'T HAVE BLACK LUNG,
MARCO.

256
00:12:55,817 --> 00:12:58,320
AND YOUR MOM?
HOW IS SHE DOING?

257
00:12:58,403 --> 00:13:00,489
I ONLY HAVE A FEW
MOM-FREE DAYS LEFT.

258
00:13:00,572 --> 00:13:03,075
IF IT'S OKAY,
I'D RATHER KEEP IT THAT WAY.

259
00:13:03,158 --> 00:13:05,244
WELL, I'M MORE INTERESTED
IN YOU, ANYWAY.

260
00:13:05,327 --> 00:13:05,994
SO, OKAY.

261
00:13:06,495 --> 00:13:08,413
FIRST SHOWER
AT YOUR BOYFRIEND'S.

262
00:13:08,497 --> 00:13:09,248
WERE YOU NAKED?

263
00:13:09,331 --> 00:13:10,832
UH, YEAH?
AND ALONE.

264
00:13:10,916 --> 00:13:13,085
WHAT?
DISAPPOINTING,

265
00:13:13,168 --> 00:13:15,420
BUT STILL PARTY WORTHY.

266
00:13:15,504 --> 00:13:17,840
ME SHOWERING
IS PARTY WORTHY?

267
00:13:17,923 --> 00:13:20,676
NO, BUT YOU
BEING HAPPY IS.

268
00:13:22,386 --> 00:13:26,265
PLUS YOU'RE YOUNG, CUTE,
CLEAN AND BLACK LUNG FREE.

269
00:13:26,348 --> 00:13:28,559
AND YOU SURE MAMA DEL ROSSI
WILL LET US HAVE A PARTY?

270
00:13:28,642 --> 00:13:31,645

296
00:15:06,865 --> 00:15:09,826

299
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:15,332
WELL, NOT TODAY.

300
00:15:15,415 --> 00:15:16,834

ALWAYS WITH THE BANNERS, MARCO?

310

CURSE OF A PRINTER'S SON.

311
00:15:59,793 --> 00:16:00,169
UGH.

312
00:16:04,131 --> 00:16:05,340
WHAT IS THIS?

313
00:16:05,424 --> 00:16:07,050
IT'S GUACAMOLE.

314
00:16:07,134 --> 00:16:08,177
SEAN MADE FOR ME.

315
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:09,970
IT'S MY FAVORITE.
HE'S SWEET.

316
00:16:10,053 --> 00:16:12,806
BABE?
THIS GUAC'S RANCID.

317
00:16:12,890 --> 00:16:14,725
JAY:
NICE LITTLE HOUSEWARMING.

318
00:16:14,808 --> 00:16:16,393
WHATEVER.

319
00:16:16,476 --> 00:16:18,312
SHE'LL GO BACK
IN A FEW DAYS.

320
00:16:18,395 --> 00:16:21,440
MAYBE THIS TIME HER MOM'LL
BURN DOWN THE WHOLE PLACE.

321
00:16:21,523 --> 00:16:23,609
NOW, THAT WOULD BE
A HOUSEWARMING.

322
00:16:23,692 --> 00:16:25,777
JAY:
SO IT'S ACTUALLY A "BON VOYAGE,
SEE YOU LATER,

323
00:16:25,861 --> 00:16:27,696
THANKS FOR ALL THE SEX" PARTY.

324
00:16:29,448 --> 00:16:30,365
WHAT?

325
00:16:37,414 --> 00:16:38,415
ELLIE.

326
00:16:39,458 --> 00:16:41,210
LOOK, HE SHOULDN'T
HAVE SAID THAT.

327
00:16:41,293 --> 00:16:42,503
I DON'T CARE
THAT HE DID.

328
00:16:42,586 --> 00:16:46,256
I JUST...I DON'T WANT
TO GO BACK TO HER.

329
00:16:47,549 --> 00:16:49,718
THEN YOU DON'T HAVE TO.

330
00:16:49,801 --> 00:16:50,219
OKAY?

331
00:16:50,719 --> 00:16:52,221
YOU CAN STAY HERE.

332
00:16:56,475 --> 00:16:58,477
MRS. NASH:
WHAT IS THIS?

333
00:16:58,977 --> 00:16:59,311
MOM?

334
00:17:00,604 --> 00:17:02,606
MRS. NASH:
HOUSEWARMING.

335
00:17:04,691 --> 00:17:06,235
I WENT TO ASHLEY'S

336
00:17:06,318 --> 00:17:08,695
AND HER MOM TOLD ME
YOU HAVEN'T BEEN STAYING THERE.

337
00:17:09,905 --> 00:17:12,324
YOU'VE BEEN HERE
THE WHOLE TIME, HAVEN'T YOU?

338
00:17:12,407 --> 00:17:13,450
HAVEN'T YOU?!

339
00:17:16,870 --> 00:17:18,914
CAB'S WAITING.
LET'S GO.

340
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:20,749
LET'S GO. NOW!

341
00:17:20,832 --> 00:17:22,000
LET'S GO. NOW!

342
00:17:23,126 --> 00:17:25,128
MRS. NASH, IT'S BETTER
IF ELLIE STAYS HERE.

343
00:17:28,090 --> 00:17:29,716
YOU DON'T COME NEAR ME.

344
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:30,843
AND DON'T COME
NEAR MY DAUGHTER.

345
00:17:49,152 --> 00:17:51,238
MRS. NASH:
THIS WAS A BLESSING.

346
00:17:51,321 --> 00:17:53,365
YOU KNOW, ELLIE, A BLESSING.

347
00:17:53,448 --> 00:17:56,451
ALL THAT OLD FURNITURE,
GRIMY PAINT.

348
00:17:56,535 --> 00:17:58,871
WE CAN START FROM SCRATCH.

349
00:17:58,954 --> 00:18:00,789
YEAH.
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

350
00:18:00,873 --> 00:18:03,000
HOW ABOUT A PERIWINKLE BLUE
IN HERE?

351
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:07,379
MOM, YOU SLAPPED
MY BOYFRIEND.

352
00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:10,215
ELLIE, THAT BOY'S
NO GOOD FOR YOU.

353
00:18:11,633 --> 00:18:13,135
I KNOW, YOU THINK
IT'LL BE HARD,

354
00:18:13,218 --> 00:18:13,969
THAT YOU LOVE HIM.

355
00:18:14,261 --> 00:18:15,053
I KNOW WHAT'S BEST.

356
00:18:15,971 --> 00:18:17,764
ELEANOR, STOP DOING THAT.

357
00:18:26,607 --> 00:18:27,858
PICK ONE, MOM.

358
00:18:27,941 --> 00:18:29,526
KNIFE? RAZOR?

359
00:18:30,652 --> 00:18:31,987
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
WHAT IS THIS?

360
00:18:32,487 --> 00:18:35,073
WHAT'S BEST FOR ME,
MOM?

361
00:18:37,409 --> 00:18:38,619
BECAUSE IF I STAY HERE,

362
00:18:38,702 --> 00:18:40,579
I'M GOING TO DO IT AGAIN.

363
00:18:40,662 --> 00:18:43,582
YOU'RE MAKING ME DO IT AGAIN!

364
00:18:43,665 --> 00:18:44,166
ELLIE?

365
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:47,169
THIS IS WHAT IT COSTS.

366
00:18:48,462 --> 00:18:50,881
YOUR DRINKING MADE ME
CUT MYSELF.

367
00:18:51,924 --> 00:18:52,758
NO, BABY.

368
00:18:54,051 --> 00:18:55,052
NO, I CAN'T.

369
00:18:55,552 --> 00:18:56,929
YOU NEED TO UNDERSTAND.

370
00:18:57,012 --> 00:18:58,555
NO. YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND...

371
00:19:02,684 --> 00:19:05,395
WHY I CAN'T KEEP LIVING
WITH YOU.

372
00:19:07,022 --> 00:19:07,272
NO.

373
00:19:10,609 --> 00:19:12,027
(SOBBING) OH MY GOD.

374
00:19:21,078 --> 00:19:21,745
(CRYING)

375
00:19:37,553 --> 00:19:38,387
HEY.

376
00:19:39,137 --> 00:19:39,847
HEY.

377
00:19:39,930 --> 00:19:41,557
ARE YOU READY
TO ORDER?

378
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:44,351
NO, ACTUALLY,
I'M NOT EATING.

379
00:19:44,434 --> 00:19:45,644
I'M JUST WAITING
FOR SOMEONE.

380
00:19:45,811 --> 00:19:47,396
OKAY. WHO?

381
00:19:48,146 --> 00:19:48,814
PAIGE.

382
00:19:50,649 --> 00:19:51,650
RIGHT.

383
00:19:52,568 --> 00:19:54,152
LOOK, I HAVE
LOT'S OF TABLES...

384
00:19:55,821 --> 00:19:56,572
YEAH.

385
00:19:56,655 --> 00:19:58,240
THE EXCITEMENT
FROM YESTERDAY

386
00:19:58,323 --> 00:20:01,618
MUST'VE GOT TO MY HEAD
OR SOMETHING.

387
00:20:01,702 --> 00:20:04,454
YEAH.
I KNOW THE FEELING.

388
00:20:04,538 --> 00:20:08,208
I WOULDN'T WANT YOU
OR PAIGE TO THINK-

389
00:20:09,501 --> 00:20:10,502
PAIGE!

390
00:20:10,586 --> 00:20:14,548
PAIGE:
JUST THE TWO PEOPLE I'VE BEEN
LITERALLY DYING TO SEE.

391
00:20:14,631 --> 00:20:17,759
BUT NOW I HAVE RISEN
TO THANK MANUELLA SANTOS,

392
00:20:17,843 --> 00:20:19,344
MY GUARDIAN ANGEL!

393
00:20:19,428 --> 00:20:20,762
EIGHT HUNDRED BUCKS

394
00:20:20,846 --> 00:20:22,890
AND OUR NEW UNIFORM DREAM
IS A REALITY!

395
00:20:23,974 --> 00:20:24,850
IT'S NO BIG DEAL.

396
00:20:25,809 --> 00:20:28,604
OH, AND I HEARD
YOU GUYS ROCKED, BEE-BEE.

397
00:20:28,687 --> 00:20:30,981
I DID IT
ALL FOR YOU.

398
00:20:44,703 --> 00:20:46,788
ELLIE:
SHE DROPPED ME OFF.

399
00:20:48,790 --> 00:20:50,042
SEAN:
SHE DROVE?

400
00:20:50,125 --> 00:20:51,668
SOBER, HONEST.

401
00:20:51,752 --> 00:20:53,545
HOPEFULLY WILL BE
FOR THE NEXT TWO MONTHS.

402
00:20:53,629 --> 00:20:54,421
SHE'S GOING TO REHAB.

403
00:20:55,714 --> 00:20:57,341
AND I'M HERE TO STAY,

404
00:20:57,424 --> 00:20:58,217
IF I WANT TO.

405
00:20:59,301 --> 00:21:00,677
DO YOU STILL WANT ME TO?

406
00:21:03,055 --> 00:21:03,430
YEAH.

407
00:21:06,350 --> 00:21:06,975
WHAT IS THAT?

408
00:21:09,186 --> 00:21:10,562
HOLD ON, HOLD ON.

409
00:21:19,696 --> 00:21:20,864
IT'S A WEASEL.

410
00:21:21,448 --> 00:21:23,492
IT'S A FERRET.

411
00:21:23,575 --> 00:21:25,327
I SAW HIM
AT THE PET STORE AND...

412
00:21:25,410 --> 00:21:26,703
SHOULDN'T WE HAVE TALKED
ABOUT THIS FIRST?

413
00:21:27,746 --> 00:21:29,831
A HOME ISN'T A HOME
WITHOUT A PET.

414
00:21:33,961 --> 00:21:34,711
(GIGGLE)
