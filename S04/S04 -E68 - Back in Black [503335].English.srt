00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:05,756
SEAN:
WE'RE ON THE FRONT PAGE
OF SOME.

2
00:00:06,423 --> 00:00:07,758
ISN'T THAT COOL?

3
00:00:07,841 --> 00:00:09,176
ELLIE:
YEAH, IT'S MONDAY

4
00:00:09,259 --> 00:00:11,345
AND THEY ARE STILL WRITING
ABOUT THE SHOOTING.

5
00:00:12,095 --> 00:00:13,639
RADITCH:
TODAY IS A DAY OF REFLECTION.

6
00:00:13,722 --> 00:00:16,350
COUNSELORS WILL BE AVAILABLE.
STUDENTS CAN TALK,

7
00:00:16,433 --> 00:00:17,935
EXPRESS THEIR FEELINGS.

8
00:00:18,018 --> 00:00:18,685
AFTER WHICH,

9
00:00:18,769 --> 00:00:21,230
IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE GET
THINGS BACK TO NORMAL.

10
00:00:21,522 --> 00:00:22,523
SEAN CAMERON!

11
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:26,068
IF I COULD
JUST TALK TO YOU

12
00:00:26,151 --> 00:00:27,319
FOR TWO MINUTES
ON CAMERA?

13
00:00:27,402 --> 00:00:28,695
ELLIE:
C'MON, SEAN.

14
00:00:28,779 --> 00:00:29,863
YOUR BOYFRIEND'S
A HERO.

15
00:00:29,947 --> 00:00:32,199
ALL I WANT TO KNOW
IS WHAT IT FEELS LIKE?

16
00:00:32,282 --> 00:00:32,991
UH...

17
00:00:39,289 --> 00:00:42,125
GUESS I'M ABOUT

00:00:51,718 --> 00:00:54,555

PAIGE:
I FEEL TOTALLY HELPLESS.

30
00:01:31,675 --> 00:01:33,343
WHAT IF JIMMY
NEVER RECOVERS?

31
00:01:35,846 --> 00:01:37,181
WHAT IF HE NEVER
WALKS AGAIN?

32
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:40,309
SAUVE:
JIMMY NEEDS HOPE.

33
00:01:40,392 --> 00:01:41,518
YOU CAN GIVE HIM THAT.

34
00:01:43,729 --> 00:01:47,107
SIMPSON:
THERE IS NO EXCUSE, NONE,
FOR WHAT RICK DID.

35
00:01:47,191 --> 00:01:48,233
BUT LABELING HIM A MONSTER

36
00:01:48,317 --> 00:01:49,776
IS NOT GOING TO HELP US
UNDERSTAND

37
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:51,987
WHY IT HAPPENED.

38
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:52,821
TOBY:
RICK WAS BULLIED.

39
00:01:52,905 --> 00:01:53,864
REALLY BAD.

40
00:01:54,948 --> 00:01:56,783
COME ON, TOBY.
DON'T MAKE RICK THE VICTIM.

41
00:01:57,492 --> 00:01:58,076
I'M NOT.

42
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:00,746
JUST...
THINK HOW HE MUST'VE FELT.

43
00:02:02,497 --> 00:02:05,334
SIMPSON:
DO YOU EVER FEEL THAT DESPERATE
OR THAT ANGRY?

44
00:02:05,417 --> 00:02:06,793
YOU NEED TO TALK TO AN ADULT

45
00:02:06,877 --> 00:02:08,921
BEFORE IT REACHES
A CRISIS POINT.

46
00:02:09,004 --> 00:02:10,255
WHAT IF NOBODY
LISTENS?

47
00:02:11,048 --> 00:02:12,883
THEN KEEP TRYING.
SOMEBODY WILL.

48
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:14,301
CRAIG:
SO WHAT?

49
00:02:14,384 --> 00:02:15,511
WE'RE SUPPOSED TO RAT?

50
00:02:16,595 --> 00:02:19,389
SIMPSON:
IT'S NOT ABOUT GETTING PEOPLE
IN TROUBLE, CRAIG.

51
00:02:19,473 --> 00:02:22,309
IT'S ABOUT GETTING THEM
AND YOU OUT OF TROUBLE.

52
00:02:22,392 --> 00:02:24,478
MARCO:
I AM... SHAKEN.

53
00:02:27,606 --> 00:02:30,234
I WANT TO TURN BACK TIME.

54
00:02:31,443 --> 00:02:32,528
I NEED...

55
00:02:33,862 --> 00:02:36,198
I NEED TO BELIEVE
THAT LIFE'S BETTER THAN THIS.

56
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:39,576
SAUVE:
THANK YOU, MARCO.

57
00:02:41,286 --> 00:02:43,247
OKAY, WHO'S NEXT?

58
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:49,336
SEAN.
LET'S HEAR FROM YOU.

59
00:02:49,419 --> 00:02:50,462
JUST REPEAT THE THREE PHRASES...

60
00:02:50,546 --> 00:02:52,798
I AM, I WANT, I NEED.

61
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:54,842
GO AHEAD.

62
00:02:59,263 --> 00:03:00,347
(MUMBLES) STUPID.

63
00:03:05,602 --> 00:03:07,604
I AM SEAN CAMERON.

64
00:03:08,438 --> 00:03:10,190
I WANT SOME
CHOCOLATE MILK

65
00:03:10,274 --> 00:03:11,859
AND I NEED THIS STUPIDITY
TO BE OVER.

66
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:15,904
SAUVE:
FINE, NO MASK.

67
00:03:17,239 --> 00:03:19,449
BUT I'D STILL LIKE
TO HEAR FROM YOU.

68
00:03:19,533 --> 00:03:20,742
I WAS FACED
WITH A SITUATION,

69
00:03:20,826 --> 00:03:23,120
I DEALT WITH IT.
END OF STORY.

70
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:25,414
IT'S PERFECTLY NORMAL
FOR THOSE WHO WITNESS VIOLENCE

71
00:03:25,497 --> 00:03:27,457
TO HAVE FEELINGS OF GUILT,
SEAN.

72
00:03:27,541 --> 00:03:28,458
GUILT?

73
00:03:28,542 --> 00:03:30,627
I STOPPED RICK
FROM KILLING PEOPLE.

74
00:03:30,711 --> 00:03:32,171
I SLEEP LIKE A BABY.

75
00:03:32,254 --> 00:03:33,964
BUT SOMEONE DID DIE,
SEAN.

76
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:34,965
RICK.

77
00:03:35,591 --> 00:03:37,509
LUCK OF THE DRAW.

78
00:03:45,142 --> 00:03:47,019
(KNOCK AT DOOR)

79
00:03:47,102 --> 00:03:49,271
SIMPSON:
SEAN. COME ON IN.

80
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:53,400
GLAD YOU'RE HERE TODAY,

81
00:03:53,483 --> 00:03:55,235
AND THAT YOU'RE NOT GOING
THROUGH THIS ALONE.

82
00:03:55,319 --> 00:03:56,486
SEAN:
THROUGH WHAT?

83
00:03:56,570 --> 00:03:57,988
BULLET MISSED ME.

84
00:04:00,866 --> 00:04:04,411
EVERYONE'S TALKING
ABOUT WHAT A HERO YOU ARE

85
00:04:04,494 --> 00:04:07,164
AND HEY, I'M IN THE "SEAN'S
A HERO" CAMP MYSELF.

86
00:04:09,291 --> 00:04:12,127
BUT YOU WERE INVOLVED
IN SOMETHING... HORRIBLE.

87
00:04:14,296 --> 00:04:15,881
I HOPE YOUR FRIENDS
UNDERSTAND THAT.

88
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:18,217
EVERYONE'S BEEN GREAT,
MR. S.

89
00:04:21,303 --> 00:04:22,679
AND ARE YOU LETTING
YOURSELF DEAL?

90
00:04:24,181 --> 00:04:25,224
EMMA: (CRYING)
DAD, I CAN'T TAKE IT!

91
00:04:25,307 --> 00:04:27,434
EVERYBODY'S STARING AT ME
EVERYWHERE I GO.

92
00:04:31,772 --> 00:04:32,856
SEAN...

93
00:04:34,691 --> 00:04:35,651
SEAN.

94
00:04:36,693 --> 00:04:38,779
SEAN, I NEVER GOT TO SAY,

95
00:04:38,862 --> 00:04:40,864
YOU SAVED MY LIFE.

96
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:45,536
YOU SAVED MY LIFE.

97
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:50,874
WE ALL NEED SOME CLOSURE,
SEAN.

98
00:04:52,042 --> 00:04:53,627
THAT'S WHAT TODAY
IS ALL ABOUT.

99
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:05,180
IT'S ONLY AN HOUR,
JAY.

100
00:05:05,264 --> 00:05:08,475
60 MINUTES OF SAUVE
GOING BLAH BLAH BLAH,

101
00:05:08,559 --> 00:05:11,061
IT'S OKAY TO CRY.
RIGHT.

102
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:12,396
YOU MAY NOT NEED TO TALK
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED,

103
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:13,146
BUT I DO.

104
00:05:14,606 --> 00:05:16,400
YEAH? WELL, JUST WATCH
WHAT YOU DO TALK ABOUT.

105
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:19,486
ELLIE:
YOU DIDN'T TRY.

106
00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:21,196
MASKS?
ELLIE, C'MON.

107
00:05:21,738 --> 00:05:23,156
SO DO AN INTERVIEW.

108
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:25,158
YOU KNOW I'M PUTTING TOGETHER
A PIECE ON YOU, SEAN?

109
00:05:25,242 --> 00:05:26,994
DO WHAT YOU WANT.
WE DON'T GET CABLE.

110
00:05:27,077 --> 00:05:27,327
RACHEL:
SEAN'S MOM DOES.

111
00:05:27,411 --> 00:05:29,705
I INTERVIEWED
HER YESTERDAY.

112
00:05:29,788 --> 00:05:30,914
SHE HAD A LOT TO SAY.

113
00:05:34,459 --> 00:05:36,503
MRS. CAMERON:
WELL, SEAN'S HAD
HIS SHARE OF PROBLEMS,

114
00:05:36,587 --> 00:05:38,797
BUT NOTHING COMPARED
WITH THIS KID.

115
00:05:38,881 --> 00:05:40,340
RACHEL ON TV:
SO DID IT COME
AS A SURPRISE TO YOU

116
00:05:40,424 --> 00:05:42,593
WHEN YOU HEARD SEAN
WAS A HERO?

117
00:05:42,676 --> 00:05:45,095
WELL, HE ALWAYS WAS
A STRONG BOY, NO FEAR.

118
00:05:45,971 --> 00:05:47,222
AND THAT USED TO GET HIM
INTO TROUBLE

119
00:05:47,306 --> 00:05:48,348
ALL THE TIME.

120
00:05:48,432 --> 00:05:50,851
BUT IT SOUNDS LIKE IT
SAVED HIM HIS LIFE THIS TIME.

121
00:05:50,934 --> 00:05:52,853
RACHEL ON TV:
IT SAVED A LOT OF LIVES.

122
00:05:52,936 --> 00:05:53,103
MRS. CAMERON:
YEAH.

123
00:05:53,187 --> 00:05:55,355
I'M SORRY, I JUST
CAN'T STOP THINKING

124
00:05:55,439 --> 00:05:58,775
WHAT IF THAT KID
HAD SHOT MY SEAN?

125
00:05:59,693 --> 00:06:02,196
WHAT IF I'D NEVER GOT
TO SEE MY BABY AGAIN?

126
00:06:02,279 --> 00:06:03,614
(CRYING)
OH GOD.

127
00:06:04,489 --> 00:06:07,659
I MISS HIM.
I LOVE HIM SO MUCH.

128
00:06:13,582 --> 00:06:15,125
JUST RUNNING THE BATTERY,
GREENPEACE.

129
00:06:15,209 --> 00:06:16,627
POLLUTION FREE.

130
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,295
IT'S NOISE POLLUTION.

131
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:20,214
BUT THAT'S NOT
WHY I'M HERE.

132
00:06:20,297 --> 00:06:21,381
HAVE YOU SEEN SEAN?

133
00:06:23,634 --> 00:06:24,843
HE'S TALKING TO HER?

134
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:31,016
RACHEL:
SEAN. THEY CLEARLY LOVE YOU.

135
00:06:31,099 --> 00:06:32,226
SEAN:
I'M FULL OF LOVE TODAY.

136
00:06:32,309 --> 00:06:33,519
JAY:
WHOA, BUDDY!

137
00:06:33,602 --> 00:06:34,394
SEAN:
SHUT UP.

138
00:06:34,478 --> 00:06:36,396
MOVE, I'M DRIVING.
GET IN.

139
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,356
ELLIE:
JUST CALM DOWN.

140
00:06:37,481 --> 00:06:38,106
SEAN:
NO.

141
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:40,067
YOU WANTED ME
TO EXPRESS MYSELF?

142
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:42,528
THIS IS ME
EXPRESSING MYSELF.

143
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:45,322
EMMA,
YOU COMING OR WHAT?

144
00:06:55,457 --> 00:06:56,208
SO WHERE TO,
BAM BAM?

145
00:06:56,291 --> 00:06:58,544
WASAGA BEACH.

146
00:06:58,627 --> 00:06:59,503
HOME.

JT:
I'M TRYING TO CUT DOWN.

153
00:07:22,484 --> 00:07:24,027
I WAS THERE, JT.

154
00:07:26,613 --> 00:07:28,782
SO WHAT DO YOU
WANT ME TO SAY?

155
00:07:28,866 --> 00:07:29,950
OKAY, I'M SORRY.

156
00:07:30,033 --> 00:07:32,452
I'M SORRY THAT YOU BECAME
FRIENDS WITH A PSYCHO.

157
00:07:33,829 --> 00:07:35,205
YOU KNEW
WHAT RICK WAS LIKE.

158
00:07:35,706 --> 00:07:37,833
I DIDN'T KNOW HE WAS GONNA
BRING A GUN TO SCHOOL.

159
00:07:38,375 --> 00:07:39,293

REALLY?

IS IT A HOUSE?
IS IT A LUNCH BOX?

162
00:08:16,705 --> 00:08:17,998
SEAN:
IT'S WHERE I WAS BORN.

163

MAYBE YOU SHOULD
COOL OFF A BIT.

164
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:21,001
WE'VE BEEN DRIVING
FOR TWO HOURS.

165

I'M COOL.

166
00:08:21,752 --> 00:08:22,586
YOU'RE NOT.

167
00:08:23,086 --> 00:08:24,588
LET HIM GO,
ELLIE.

168
00:08:24,671 --> 00:08:25,756
HE SHOULD HAVE DONE
THIS YEARS AGO.

HOLD YOUR HORSES.
I'M COMING.

171
00:08:33,805 --> 00:08:34,973
ALL RIGHT!

172
00:08:37,601 --> 00:08:38,852
SEAN?

173
00:08:38,936 --> 00:08:39,811
I HEARD WHAT HAPPENED.

174
00:08:39,895 --> 00:08:41,855
YEAH, I KNOW.

175
00:08:41,939 --> 00:08:43,732

THE PERFORMANCE.

00:08:45,192 --> 00:08:46,652
WHAT IF I NEVER
GET TO SEE HIM AGAIN?

178
00:08:46,735 --> 00:08:48,320
OH, I LOVE HIM,
BOO-HOO."

179
00:08:48,403 --> 00:08:49,279
OH SEAN...

180
00:08:49,363 --> 00:08:50,197
NEXT INTERVIEW?

181
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:51,657
TRY TELLING THEM
THE TRUTH.

182
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:53,075
LIKE HOW YOU GAVE UP
ON ME,

183
00:08:53,158 --> 00:08:54,701
HOW YOU BOOTED ME
OUT OF YOUR LIFE.

184
00:08:54,785 --> 00:08:56,328
JUST STOP PLAYING THE POOR
ABANDONED MOTHER ROLE

185
00:08:56,411 --> 00:08:57,746
BECAUSE NOBODY'S
BUYING IT!

186
00:08:59,122 --> 00:09:01,416
ESPECIALLY NOT ME.

187
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:02,459
OKAY.

188
00:09:19,101 --> 00:09:20,727
ELLIE:
IT'S LIKE A MUD BATH.

189
00:09:20,811 --> 00:09:22,187
BUT IT'S COLD AND SANDY,

190
00:09:22,271 --> 00:09:24,940
AND IT KINDA SMELLS LIKE FISH.

191
00:09:25,023 --> 00:09:25,315
EW.

192
00:09:26,358 --> 00:09:28,402
JAY:
YO, CAMERON.
SPROUT'S GETTING LOOSE.

193
00:09:41,915 --> 00:09:43,083
JAY:
WHO ARE YOU CHECKING OUT?

194
00:09:43,166 --> 00:09:44,293
ALL I SEE IS SOME GUY.

195
00:09:45,085 --> 00:09:46,753
THAT'S TYLER BISHOP.

196
00:09:47,254 --> 00:09:48,630
EMMA:
HE'S THE KID YOU DEAFENED.

197
00:09:48,714 --> 00:09:50,007
SEAN:
IN ONE EAR.

198
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:51,300
IDIOT JUMPED ME.

199
00:09:51,383 --> 00:09:52,843
THOUGHT HE WAS TOUGH.

200
00:09:53,844 --> 00:09:54,720
I WAS TOUGHER.

201
00:09:55,179 --> 00:09:56,638
JAY:
SO HE GOT HALF DEAF,

202
00:09:56,722 --> 00:09:59,516
WHILE YOU GOT SENT TO TORONTO,
TO TRACKER,

203
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,685
TO STUDENT WELFARE?

204
00:10:02,561 --> 00:10:04,563
YOU ASK ME,
I'D SAY THIS GUY OWES YOU.

205
00:10:16,575 --> 00:10:18,327
I DIDN'T KNOW JIMMY
HAD SO MANY FRIENDS.

206
00:10:19,494 --> 00:10:21,997
JODIE MATENKO?
HEATHER SINCLAIR?

207
00:10:22,915 --> 00:10:24,416
A LOT OF THESE
ARE FROM STRANGERS.

208
00:10:24,499 --> 00:10:25,334
REALLY?

209
00:10:25,417 --> 00:10:27,002
PEOPLE WHO DON'T
EVEN KNOW JIMMY

210
00:10:27,085 --> 00:10:28,295
CARE ABOUT HIM.

211
00:10:28,378 --> 00:10:30,088
MY OWN FRIENDS
WON'T TALK TO ME.

212
00:10:35,761 --> 00:10:37,763
I-I HAVE TO GO
TO RICK'S VISITATION TONIGHT,

213
00:10:37,846 --> 00:10:39,932
BUT I CAN'T FACE HIS MOM.

214
00:10:40,516 --> 00:10:41,683
WHAT ABOUT JT?

215
00:10:43,644 --> 00:10:44,561
WHAT ABOUT HIM?

216
00:10:56,782 --> 00:10:59,201
SO UH, WHAT'S IT GONNA COST
TO RENT ONE OF THESE THINGS?

217
00:11:00,911 --> 00:11:03,539
YOU KNOW,
ONE OF THESE THINGS?

218
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:07,668
TYLER:
I NEVER THOUGHT
YOU'D BE STUPID ENOUGH

219
00:11:07,751 --> 00:11:08,460
TO COME BACK HERE,
CAMERON!

220
00:11:08,544 --> 00:11:11,046
ELLIE:
STOP IT! STOP IT, OKAY?

221
00:11:13,674 --> 00:11:16,051
PAPERS THINK YOU'RE
SOME KIND OF HERO...

222
00:11:16,134 --> 00:11:17,469
WRESTLING GUN-SLINGERS.

223
00:11:17,803 --> 00:11:19,221
DIDN'T KNOW
YOU COULD READ.

224
00:11:19,304 --> 00:11:20,764
SAW YOUR PICTURE.

225
00:11:20,848 --> 00:11:22,307
RECOGNIZED THE EYEBROWS.

226
00:11:25,143 --> 00:11:26,228
PISSED?

227
00:11:27,813 --> 00:11:28,814
GO ON.

228
00:11:29,356 --> 00:11:30,440
SUCKER PUNCH ME
IN THE OTHER EAR

229
00:11:30,524 --> 00:11:31,441
AND FLEE TOWN.

230
00:11:31,984 --> 00:11:33,026
THAT'S YOUR MOVE,
ISN'T IT?

231
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:37,990
LET'S GO.

232
00:11:38,615 --> 00:11:40,325
OR DO YOU KILL AND RUN
THESE DAYS?

233
00:11:41,159 --> 00:11:43,954
CAUSE THE KID DIED
THIS TIME.

234
00:11:44,037 --> 00:11:45,747
DIDN'T HE, HERO?

235
00:11:47,791 --> 00:11:49,209
THINK YOU'RE A HERO?
HUH? YEAH?

236
00:11:52,796 --> 00:11:55,465
SIXTY BUCKS,
SIXTY MINUTES.

237
00:11:58,343 --> 00:12:00,470
FREE FOR YOU,
TRAILER PARK BOY.

238
00:12:00,554 --> 00:12:02,890
WOULDN'T WANT TO TAKE
YOUR LUNCH MONEY...

239
00:12:02,931 --> 00:12:03,932
AGAIN.

240
00:12:16,695 --> 00:12:19,865
SO, THAT WAS FUN...

241
00:12:19,948 --> 00:12:21,200
MEETING TYLER.

242
00:12:22,534 --> 00:12:23,911
GOOD TIMES.

243
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:27,956
HE GOT A LOT
OFF HIS CHEST.

244
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:28,665
SEAN...

245
00:12:29,208 --> 00:12:29,625
WHAT?

246
00:12:31,376 --> 00:12:33,962
YOUR STORIES
DON'T REALLY MESH.

247
00:12:37,341 --> 00:12:38,425
SO YOU BELIEVE HIM.

248
00:12:38,967 --> 00:12:41,428
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
TO BELIEVE, OKAY?

249
00:12:41,512 --> 00:12:44,056
I AM TRYING TO UNDERSTAND
WHAT YOU'RE GOING THROUGH,

250
00:12:44,139 --> 00:12:45,557
BUT YOU WON'T
EVEN TALK TO ME.

251
00:12:46,141 --> 00:12:48,810
YOU WANT ME TO TALK?
FINE.

252
00:12:48,894 --> 00:12:50,312
WHEN THE GUN WENT OFF

253
00:12:50,395 --> 00:12:52,314
MY HAND WAS COVERED
IN WARM LIQUID.

254
00:12:52,397 --> 00:12:53,649
I THOUGHT
I'D PISSED MYSELF,

255
00:12:53,649 --> 00:12:54,566
BUT THEN I REALIZED

256
00:12:54,566 --> 00:12:56,235
THAT I WAS DRENCHED
IN RICK'S BLOOD.

257
00:12:59,321 --> 00:13:01,490
AND THEN,
AND THEN WHEN HE FELL-

258
00:13:01,573 --> 00:13:02,824
SEAN...

259
00:13:02,908 --> 00:13:03,659
NO.

260
00:13:06,286 --> 00:13:06,703
SEAN!

261
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:10,415
YOU'RE NOT DOING
THIS TO ME.

262
00:13:10,958 --> 00:13:11,375
SEAN!

263
00:13:39,528 --> 00:13:40,445
SEAN!

264
00:14:16,023 --> 00:14:17,983
EMMA:
SEAN! SEAN! SEAN!

265
00:14:18,984 --> 00:14:20,652
SEAN, WAKE UP. SEAN!

266
00:14:21,153 --> 00:14:22,988
(COUGHING, SPUTTERING)

267
00:14:24,615 --> 00:14:26,408
ELLIE:
COME ON.

268
00:14:26,491 --> 00:14:27,492
WHAT HAPPENED?

269
00:14:27,576 --> 00:14:29,536
YOU NEARLY DROWNED.
TYLER SAVED YOUR LIFE.

270
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:43,634
MANNY:
JT.

271
00:14:44,259 --> 00:14:46,136
JT:
MANNY, HOW ARE YOU?

272
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:47,721
MANNY:
I'M ALL RIGHT.

273
00:14:47,804 --> 00:14:50,224
BETTER THAN A CERTAIN
BEST FRIEND OF YOURS.

274
00:14:50,307 --> 00:14:51,141
JT:
EX-BEST FRIEND.

275
00:14:51,225 --> 00:14:53,560
THAT WAS BEFORE HE JOINED FORCES
WITH HELL BOY.

276
00:14:53,644 --> 00:14:55,812
WHO I KNOW IS A SUPER-HERO,
BUT WHATEVER.

277
00:14:55,896 --> 00:14:58,565
TOBY'S A GEEK.
HE ALWAYS HAS BEEN.

278
00:14:58,649 --> 00:15:03,070
MANNY:
OKAY, YOU OUT-GEEK THEM
ALL JAMES TIBERIUS YORKE.

279
00:15:03,153 --> 00:15:05,072
BUT TOBY WAS ALWAYS
THERE FOR YOU.

280
00:15:05,155 --> 00:15:06,990
TIBERIUS IS A FAMILY NAME,
ALL RIGHT?

281
00:15:07,074 --> 00:15:09,868
IF YOU HADN'T DITCHED HIM
FOR WEBSTER HERE,

282
00:15:09,952 --> 00:15:11,537
HE WOULD HAVE NEVER
HOOKED UP WITH RICK.

283
00:15:12,704 --> 00:15:16,333
AND YOU'RE LECTURING ME
ON DITCHING PEOPLE? HM.

284
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:19,628
NOW I REMEMBER
WHY WE BROKE UP.

285
00:15:19,711 --> 00:15:22,965
YOU JUST CAN'T BE
THE BIGGER MAN.

286
00:15:29,388 --> 00:15:31,014
DON'T SAY IT.

287
00:15:43,318 --> 00:15:44,528
SEAN?

288
00:15:46,488 --> 00:15:48,824
MAYBE YOU NEED
TO SEE A DOCTOR?

289
00:15:48,907 --> 00:15:50,158
I'M FINE.

290
00:15:50,909 --> 00:15:52,578
JUST THINKING.

291
00:15:53,287 --> 00:15:54,621
ABOUT WHAT?

292
00:15:56,915 --> 00:15:58,584
EM, I'M SORRY.

293
00:15:59,543 --> 00:16:00,794
FOR WHAT?

294
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:03,380
FOR LAST YEAR,
YOU KNOW?

295
00:16:03,463 --> 00:16:06,633
FOR EVERYTHING
I PUT YOU THROUGH.

296
00:16:06,717 --> 00:16:08,093
EVERYTHING.

297
00:16:08,969 --> 00:16:10,304
I'M SORRY.

298
00:16:11,889 --> 00:16:13,724
ANCIENT HISTORY.

299
00:16:14,808 --> 00:16:18,145
SO MAYBE WE SHOULD
GET GOING, HUH?

300
00:16:20,856 --> 00:16:22,316
WE GOT A PIT STOP
TO MAKE FIRST.

301
00:16:41,126 --> 00:16:41,919
MR. CAMERON:
DOOR!

302
00:16:42,002 --> 00:16:44,421
MRS. CAMERON:
YOU HAVE LEGS,
DON'T YOU?

303
00:16:44,505 --> 00:16:45,839
GEEZ.

304
00:16:57,017 --> 00:16:59,978
SO UH... HOW LONG TILL
THE COPS GET HERE?

305
00:17:02,648 --> 00:17:03,649
MRS. CAMERON:
NO, NO, NO.

306
00:17:03,732 --> 00:17:05,150
SEAN, WAIT.
DON'T PLEASE.

307
00:17:05,234 --> 00:17:06,985
JUST IGNORE HIM.
HE DIDN'T MEAN IT.

308
00:17:08,987 --> 00:17:10,781
I'M HERE WITH FRIENDS,
DAD.

309
00:17:10,864 --> 00:17:11,740
THAT'S ALL.

310
00:17:13,158 --> 00:17:17,162
IT'S BEEN OVER FOUR YEARS.
NO CALLS, NO NOTHING.

311
00:17:17,829 --> 00:17:19,206
NOW HERE YOU ARE,

312
00:17:19,289 --> 00:17:22,459
YOU EXPECT US TO BELIEVE
IT'S JUST FOR KICKS?

313
00:17:24,670 --> 00:17:27,422
WHAT I SAID
TO THAT REPORTER LADY?

314
00:17:27,506 --> 00:17:29,007
IT WASN'T LIES.

315
00:17:29,466 --> 00:17:31,176
I CAN'T CRY ON CUE,
SEAN.

316
00:17:32,928 --> 00:17:35,764
I MEAN, WE'VE MADE
A LOT MISTAKES, BUT...

317
00:17:35,848 --> 00:17:37,307
BUT SENDING YOU
TO TORONTO?

318
00:17:37,391 --> 00:17:40,269
THAT WAS THE BEST THING
WE EVER DID.

319
00:17:40,352 --> 00:17:42,604
HOW ELSE WAS I GONNA
KEEP YOU OUT OF JAIL?

320
00:17:44,356 --> 00:17:45,524
I KNOW.

321
00:17:47,276 --> 00:17:48,569
SO WHY ARE YOU BACK?

322
00:17:50,696 --> 00:17:52,322
THAT KID AT SCHOOL,

323
00:17:54,408 --> 00:17:56,243
HE WAS GONNA
SHOOT MY FRIEND.

324
00:17:58,871 --> 00:18:00,873
SO, SO I GRABBED THE GUN...

325
00:18:03,333 --> 00:18:04,668
AND IT WENT OFF.

326
00:18:06,336 --> 00:18:08,672
I-I THINK-
I THINK I MIGHT'VE-

327
00:18:08,755 --> 00:18:09,840
OH GOD!

328
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:11,800
I MIGHT'VE KILLED HIM.

329
00:18:11,884 --> 00:18:13,302
I MIGHT'VE KILLED HIM.

330
00:18:13,385 --> 00:18:14,511
(CRYING)

331
00:18:14,595 --> 00:18:16,597
HE DIED.
HE DIED.

332
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:19,099
HE DIED.

333
00:18:21,018 --> 00:18:22,477
IT'S OKAY, KID.

334
00:18:22,561 --> 00:18:23,228
IT'S ALL RIGHT.

335
00:18:23,729 --> 00:18:25,272
YOU'RE HOME.
WE GOTCHA.

336
00:18:27,566 --> 00:18:28,233
SEAN:
(SOBS) HE DIED.

337
00:18:32,571 --> 00:18:33,906
(MUFFLED COMMENT)

338
00:18:33,989 --> 00:18:35,616
MRS. CAMERON:
IT'S ALL RIGHT.

339
00:18:35,699 --> 00:18:36,658
MR. CAMERON:
YOU'LL BE ALL RIGHT.

340
00:18:50,964 --> 00:18:52,591
I-I CAN'T DO THIS.

341
00:18:54,426 --> 00:18:55,761
IT'S, IT'S OKAY.

342
00:18:56,595 --> 00:18:57,596
YOU CAN JUST LEAVE.

343
00:18:58,931 --> 00:18:59,932
RICK'S MOM:
TOBY.

344
00:19:00,015 --> 00:19:00,933
TOBE!

345
00:19:02,059 --> 00:19:02,768
YOU CAME.

346
00:19:03,852 --> 00:19:04,269
TOBY.

347
00:19:07,731 --> 00:19:10,359
YOU WERE ALWAYS
SUCH A GOOD FRIEND.

348
00:19:10,442 --> 00:19:12,528
SUCH A GOOD FRIEND.

349
00:19:15,239 --> 00:19:16,573
JT:
MRS. MURRAY?

350
00:19:18,659 --> 00:19:19,618
I JUST WANTED TO SAY

351
00:19:19,701 --> 00:19:20,953
I'M VERY SORRY
FOR WHAT HAPPENED.

352
00:19:22,037 --> 00:19:23,205
RICK'S MOM:
YOU WERE A FRIEND OF RICK'S?

353
00:19:24,831 --> 00:19:26,375
IT WAS A TRAGEDY.
I'M VERY SORRY.

354
00:19:31,255 --> 00:19:33,090
RICK'S MOM:
THANK YOU.

355
00:19:33,632 --> 00:19:34,466
THANK YOU.

356
00:19:39,221 --> 00:19:42,391
IT DOESN'T MATTER
WHAT I THOUGHT OF RICK.

357
00:19:42,474 --> 00:19:43,976
IT STILL SHOULDN'T
HAVE HAPPENED.

358
00:20:01,994 --> 00:20:04,621
I TOLD THEM
EVERYTHING.

359
00:20:04,705 --> 00:20:05,914
LET'S GET YOU
OUT OF HERE.

360
00:20:09,126 --> 00:20:10,294
ELLIE...

361
00:20:11,503 --> 00:20:13,797
LOOK,
I DON'T HOW...

362
00:20:14,298 --> 00:20:17,676
YOU'RE, YOU'RE STAYING,
AREN'T YOU?

363
00:20:18,969 --> 00:20:20,554
SEAN, PLEASE.

364
00:20:21,930 --> 00:20:23,599
I, I LOVE YOU.

365
00:20:24,683 --> 00:20:26,727
I LOVE YOU,
TOO.

366
00:20:26,810 --> 00:20:28,187
BUT, ELLIE...

367
00:20:29,855 --> 00:20:32,941
WELL, WHEN ARE YOU
COMING BACK?

368
00:20:37,029 --> 00:20:38,238
YO CAMERON,
GET IN THE CAR.

369
00:20:39,531 --> 00:20:42,159
STAYING.
I'M STAYING.

370
00:20:44,536 --> 00:20:45,579
LOOK, FOR THE FIRST TIME
IN MY LIFE

371
00:20:45,662 --> 00:20:46,788
I NEED TO BE HERE

372
00:20:46,872 --> 00:20:49,374
WITH MY PARENTS...
TO DEAL.

373
00:20:52,628 --> 00:20:53,629
YOU SURE ABOUT THIS?

374
00:20:57,549 --> 00:20:59,593
OKAY, MAN.
SEE YA.
