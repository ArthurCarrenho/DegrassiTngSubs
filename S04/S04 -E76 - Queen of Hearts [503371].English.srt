00:08:22,294 --> 00:08:23,128
(LAUGHTER)

182
00:08:24,213 --> 00:08:27,174
I WAS SANS PRODUCT
THIS MORNING, CRAIG.

183
00:08:27,257 --> 00:08:30,219
AND YOU SAID
IT LOOKED FINE.

184
00:08:30,302 --> 00:08:33,055
MARCO, BEGONE.
ELLIE, YOU'RE IN.

185
00:08:33,138 --> 00:08:35,849
I CAN'T TAKE
MARCO'S PLACE.

186
00:08:35,933 --> 00:08:38,060
NO, IT'S OKAY.
SIT.

187
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:40,687
DYLAN'S ENTIRE HOCKEY TEAM
COMBINED

188
00:08:40,771 --> 00:08:43,357
IS LESS COMPETITIVE
THAN HER.

189
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,150
ALEX:
THE ACE OF SPADES IS DOWN.

190
00:08:45,234 --> 00:08:48,403
MEANING IT'S THEIR TRICK
SO FAR?

191
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:51,490
CRAIG:
THAT'S THE QUEEN.

192
00:08:51,573 --> 00:08:52,407
OF HEARTS.

193
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:55,077
YOU SURE YOU WANT
TO LEAD TRUMP?

194
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:59,331
WELL, I DON'T HAVE NO SPADES
AND THAT'S MY LOWEST HEART.

195
00:08:59,414 --> 00:09:00,958
(SCHOOL BELL RINGS)

196
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:04,294
I GET A SCATTER-PROOF PARTNER
ONLY TO STOP FOR FRENCH CLASS?

197
00:09:04,378 --> 00:09:07,130
OH WELL,
JE SUIS UP FOR SKIPPING.

198
00:09:07,214 --> 00:09:07,923
(LAUGHS)

199
00:09:08,006 --> 00:09:08,757
WHERE TO?

200
00:09:13,971 --> 00:09:17,099
MATT:
TODAY I THOUGHT WE'D TALK ABOUT
BIAS IN THE MEDIA -

201
00:09:17,182 --> 00:09:19,768
HOW THE NEWS SOMETIMES
TWISTS THE FACTS.

202
00:09:19,852 --> 00:09:21,562
YOU'RE DOING THE NOD OF SLEEP?

203
00:09:21,645 --> 00:09:23,564
IT'S NOT ATTRACTIVE.

204
00:09:23,647 --> 00:09:24,982
AVERT YOUR EYES.

205
00:09:25,607 --> 00:09:28,318
EVIL MEERI KEPT ME
FOR THE LATE SHIFT.

206
00:09:28,402 --> 00:09:30,070
MATT:
PAIGE.

207
00:09:30,153 --> 00:09:34,867
CAN YOU TELL ME HOW THAT'S
DIFFERENT FROM OUTRIGHT LYING?

208
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:37,953
TO LIE IS TO PRESENT
A FALSEHOOD.

209
00:09:38,036 --> 00:09:40,706
BIAS IS TELLING
THE TRUTH JUST...

210
00:09:40,789 --> 00:09:43,166
A VERSION OF THE TRUTH.

211
00:09:43,834 --> 00:09:44,209
GOOD.

212
00:09:46,753 --> 00:09:50,257
OKAY, SO BACK TO WHY
POP STARS MARRY

213
00:09:51,508 --> 00:09:53,760
ONCE THEY RELEASE A NEW CD.

214
00:09:59,641 --> 00:10:04,021
I'VE NEVER HAD A TEACHER
PASS ME A NOTE BEFORE.

215
00:10:04,688 --> 00:10:06,982
LOOK I KNOW THIS PLACE
ISN'T EXACTLY ROMANTIC,

216
00:10:07,065 --> 00:10:09,109
BUT IT SEEMS LIKE
EVERY TIME

217
00:10:09,193 --> 00:10:10,110
WE TRY TO GET TOGETHER-
(DOOR RATTLES)

218
00:10:10,194 --> 00:10:12,237
-THERE'S SOMETHING.

219
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:19,161
ELLIE:
THERE'S ALWAYS THE BASEMENT?

220
00:10:25,584 --> 00:10:26,877
(RELIEVED SIGH)

221
00:10:27,544 --> 00:10:28,879
MATT, THAT'S IT.

222
00:10:28,962 --> 00:10:32,216
TONIGHT AFTER WORK
I COME OVER.

223
00:10:32,299 --> 00:10:33,425
WHERE? AT MY PLACE?

224
00:10:33,509 --> 00:10:36,386
YEAH, I WANT TO SEE YOUR
PRIVATE BOHEMIAN MAN-LAIR.

225
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:38,263
PAIGE, YOU CAN'T.

226
00:10:38,347 --> 00:10:40,307
I'M FAMILIAR WITH
THE STUDENT LIFESTYLE.

227
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:41,308
MY BROTHER?

228
00:10:41,391 --> 00:10:44,228
HE SHARES ONE BATHROOM
WITH TWELVE GUYS.

229
00:10:44,311 --> 00:10:47,648
AT LEAST YOU HAVE
A PLACE OF YOUR OWN.

230
00:10:47,731 --> 00:10:51,068
WITH WHAT?
A COMFY COUCH, TV, DVD.

231
00:10:52,861 --> 00:10:55,322
AWAY FROM DISTRACTIONS.

232
00:10:55,405 --> 00:10:56,156
NO.

233
00:10:58,534 --> 00:11:01,411
IT'S GOT TO BE SOMETHING,
OR SOMEPLACE ELSE.

234
00:11:01,495 --> 00:11:02,746
LOOK, I'LL POP BY
THE THEATRE

235
00:11:02,829 --> 00:11:05,249
AND WE'LL GO OUT
FOR COFFEE AFTER WORK.

236
00:11:05,332 --> 00:11:06,166
MATT.

237
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:08,210
WAIT A BIT BEFORE YOU LEAVE.

238
00:11:08,293 --> 00:11:09,795
(BLOWS HER A KISS)

239
00:11:13,882 --> 00:11:15,050
(ANNOYED SIGH)

240
00:11:17,928 --> 00:11:20,013
ALEX:
(LAUGHS) YES!

241
00:11:20,514 --> 00:11:22,224
OKAY, OKAY.
ALL RIGHT, REMATCH.

242
00:11:22,307 --> 00:11:23,308
OKAY? RIGHT NOW.

243
00:11:23,392 --> 00:11:25,727
ELLIE:
UM, THAT WAS THE REMATCH.

244
00:11:25,811 --> 00:11:29,690
ALEX:
UNLESS YOU WANT TO MAKE IT
MORE INTERESTING.

245
00:11:29,773 --> 00:11:32,025
AS IN UH, "STRIP EUCHRE"?

246
00:11:32,109 --> 00:11:33,610
CRAIG:
(LAUGHS)

247
00:11:33,694 --> 00:11:35,237
ALEX:
AS IN MONEY.

248
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:37,072
AS IN TWENTY DOLLARS?

249
00:11:38,448 --> 00:11:38,866
OKAY.

250
00:11:39,950 --> 00:11:40,367
OKAY.

251
00:11:44,955 --> 00:11:45,330
OKAY.

252
00:11:52,129 --> 00:11:53,046
AND IT'S CLUBS.

253
00:11:53,130 --> 00:11:54,089
ELLIE:
OH.

254
00:11:54,173 --> 00:11:55,674
UM, ONE QUESTION -

255
00:11:56,175 --> 00:11:58,010
WHY DO THEY CALL THESE
"BOWERS"?

256
00:11:58,093 --> 00:11:58,760
(LAUGHS)

257
00:11:59,469 --> 00:12:02,347
WE SKIPPED FRENCH CLASS
FOR THIS?

258
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:03,098
COME ON.

259
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:07,060
ALEX:
TEN BUCKS EACH.

260
00:12:07,144 --> 00:12:07,394
NOT REAL MONEY,

261
00:12:07,477 --> 00:12:09,521
BUT IT'LL BUY
A CAFETERIA LUNCH.

262
00:12:09,605 --> 00:12:10,772
WAIT.

263
00:12:10,856 --> 00:12:13,358
TODAY'S THURSDAY,
RIGHT?

264
00:12:14,318 --> 00:12:17,905
I THINK I KNOW WHERE
REAL MONEY'S GONNA BE.

265
00:12:23,243 --> 00:12:25,245
ALEX AND I WOULD LIKE
TO PLAY EUCHRE

266
00:12:25,329 --> 00:12:28,916
WITH YOU AND DYLAN
AND DYLAN'S HOCKEY TEAM.

267
00:12:28,999 --> 00:12:29,750
IF...

268
00:12:30,417 --> 00:12:31,793
IF I HOOK YOU UP,

269
00:12:33,128 --> 00:12:35,547
NEW PLAYERS HAVE TO HOST
THE EVENING.

270
00:12:35,631 --> 00:12:38,300
I CAN HOST,
HOSTESS WHATEVER.

271
00:12:38,383 --> 00:12:41,803
WHICH MEANS BUYING PIZZA,
PLAYING 50, 60 DOLLAR HANDS,

272
00:12:41,887 --> 00:12:45,682
AND LOSING THE LITTLE MONEY
THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE.

273
00:12:45,766 --> 00:12:47,309
WE HAVE MONEY.

274
00:12:47,392 --> 00:12:48,519
WE DO.

275
00:12:48,602 --> 00:12:51,980
JUST NOT ANY MONEY
WE PLAN TO LOSE.

276
00:12:54,441 --> 00:12:55,484
(SIGHS)

277
00:12:58,153 --> 00:13:00,447
SO MR. O -
HE'S CUTE.

278
00:13:02,491 --> 00:13:04,159
AND SMART AND...

279
00:13:05,118 --> 00:13:07,246
FUNNY WITH
A TIGHT LITTLE YOGA BODY

280
00:13:07,329 --> 00:13:09,331
THROWN IN FOR FUN.

281
00:13:10,791 --> 00:13:11,625
BUT...

282
00:13:12,793 --> 00:13:14,837
THE "BIG SECRET".

283
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:17,464
THE ONLY PLACE
WE CAN ESCAPE TO

284
00:13:17,548 --> 00:13:20,509
WHERE HE AND ME
CAN BE A "WE"

285
00:13:22,886 --> 00:13:23,971
IS HIS.

286
00:13:25,347 --> 00:13:28,100
HE DOESN'T WANT ME
GOING THERE.

287
00:13:28,183 --> 00:13:30,352
IT SOUNDS TO ME THEN

288
00:13:31,311 --> 00:13:35,524
THERE'S NOT A LOT
OF HONESTY GOING AROUND.

289
00:13:35,607 --> 00:13:37,818
NOBODY CAN KNOW ABOUT THIS,
MANNY.

290
00:13:37,901 --> 00:13:41,238
NO NOT AROUND THE SCHOOL.
I MEAN BETWEEN YOU AND HIM.

291
00:13:41,321 --> 00:13:42,614
A GUY LIKE THAT,
I'M SURPRISED HE DOESN'T HAVE

292
00:13:42,698 --> 00:13:43,740
A GIRLFRIEND.

293
00:13:44,658 --> 00:13:47,494
HE DID HAVE ONE
BUT THEY SPLIT.

294
00:13:49,079 --> 00:13:51,415
AND THAT'S WHAT HE TOLD YOU?

295
00:14:01,717 --> 00:14:03,677
THAT'S MY WHOLE
LAST PAYCHECK.

296
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:06,680
PLUS TEN DOLLARS
FROM THIS MORNING.

297
00:14:06,763 --> 00:14:08,724
IT ISN'T ENOUGH, IS IT?

298
00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:14,771
ELLIE:
$540.

299
00:14:16,523 --> 00:14:18,775
OTHERWISE KNOWN AS MY RENT.

300
00:14:25,616 --> 00:14:28,493
LET'S NOT USE
ALL OF IT.

301
00:14:28,577 --> 00:14:30,996
I LIKE THIS,
PLAYING THIS.

302
00:14:31,079 --> 00:14:34,291
THE "PARTNER" THING
WORKS FOR ME.

303
00:14:34,374 --> 00:14:34,875
ELLIE?

304
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:36,168
THE HOCKEY TEAM JUST GOT HERE

305
00:14:36,251 --> 00:14:40,005
AND WE'VE ALREADY GONE THROUGH
THE PIZZETTES.

306
00:14:40,714 --> 00:14:41,673
LET ME INTRODUCE YOU
TO THE TEAM.

307
00:14:41,757 --> 00:14:43,800
THEY WANT TO GET STARTED.

308
00:14:44,426 --> 00:14:45,344
I'M ALEX.

309
00:14:45,427 --> 00:14:47,638
THIS IS ELLIE,

310
00:14:47,721 --> 00:14:50,307

00:15:32,850 --> 00:15:33,976
WE HAVE TO TAKE
THE NEXT HAND.

326
00:15:34,059 --> 00:15:35,519
AND IF WE LOSE IT?

327
00:15:35,602 --> 00:15:38,021
LET ME BE THE NEGATIVE ONE,
OKAY?

328
00:15:38,105 --> 00:15:39,022
IT'S A BIGGER GAMBLE

329
00:15:39,106 --> 00:15:41,024
BUT JAMES WANTS
TO PUT MORE MONEY DOWN.

330
00:15:41,108 --> 00:15:43,610
YOU ALL RIGHT
WITH THAT?

331
00:15:47,447 --> 00:15:48,407
MOVE IN!

332
00:15:48,490 --> 00:15:49,241
SURE I'LL GO GET
MY THINGS.

333
00:15:49,324 --> 00:15:50,242
I'M SERIOUS.

334
00:15:50,325 --> 00:15:51,910
MOVE IN.
IT'D BE COOL.

335
00:15:51,994 --> 00:15:53,328
COOL?
SURE NO MOM,

336
00:15:53,412 --> 00:15:55,455
NO MOM'S BOYFRIEND
OF THE WEEK,

337
00:15:55,539 --> 00:15:56,915
BUT THERE'S THIS THING
CALLED RENT.

338
00:15:56,999 --> 00:15:59,293
ONLY $270 A MONTH EACH.

339
00:15:59,376 --> 00:16:01,420
I CAN'T AFFORD
$2 A MONTH.

340
00:16:01,503 --> 00:16:02,921
SO I'LL PAY MORE,

341
00:16:03,005 --> 00:16:04,464
OR I WON'T TELL MY MOM
YOU'RE LIVING HERE.

342
00:16:04,548 --> 00:16:06,133
IT'S NOT LIKE
SHE COMES AROUND.

343
00:16:06,216 --> 00:16:08,719
AND THIS IS THE
HORRIBLE WOMAN YOU HATE?

344
00:16:08,802 --> 00:16:11,263
IT'D BE GREAT, OKAY?
IT'D BE FUN.

345
00:16:11,346 --> 00:16:13,932
RIGHT NOW I NEED FUN.

346
00:16:14,016 --> 00:16:16,101
MOVE TO WASAGA WITH SEAN
IF YOU'RE LONELY

347
00:16:16,185 --> 00:16:18,604
OR SUCK IT UP
AND GO HOME.

348
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:20,105
MY MOM WAS DRUNK...

349
00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:22,816
ALWAYS DRUNK.

350
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:25,485
RIGHT UP TO THE NIGHT
SHE LIT THE HOUSE ON FIRE.

351
00:16:25,569 --> 00:16:27,779
BUT SHE'S SOBER NOW.

352
00:16:27,863 --> 00:16:29,198
AND PAYING YOUR RENT.

353
00:16:29,281 --> 00:16:32,117
ALL THE TIME TRYING TO MAKE
THINGS RIGHT WITH YOU.

354
00:16:32,201 --> 00:16:34,369
WOW, WHAT A MONSTER.

355
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:38,207
THE HOCKEY BOYS
ARE WAITING.

356
00:16:38,290 --> 00:16:39,541
WHEN YOU COME BACK
TO THE TABLE

357
00:16:39,625 --> 00:16:42,461
LEAVE THE SUCKY GIRL BEHIND.

358
00:16:50,052 --> 00:16:51,803
HI, CUSTOMER SERVICE?

359
00:16:52,596 --> 00:16:57,142

360
00:16:57,726 --> 00:17:00,562

361
00:17:01,563 --> 00:17:02,731
SO IT MUST BE...

362
00:17:03,565 --> 00:17:05,067
OKAY, THANKS. BYE.

363
00:17:08,570 --> 00:17:11,156
FIVE MORE SECONDS.
PLEASE, MEERI.

364
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:13,283
HE STOOD YOU UP,
DIDN'T HE?

365
00:17:13,367 --> 00:17:15,869
HE'S NOT CHEATING ON ME
IF THAT'S WHAT YOU THINK.

366
00:17:15,953 --> 00:17:17,538
MEERI:
I THINK?

367
00:17:17,621 --> 00:17:19,957
THAT'S WHAT YOU THINK.

368
00:17:23,252 --> 00:17:24,294
(SIGHS)

369
00:17:28,215 --> 00:17:29,675
ALEX:

I'M GOING ALONE.

371
00:17:32,970 --> 00:17:34,304
WHAT?!

372
00:17:34,388 --> 00:17:36,056
YOU KNOW YOU'RE A POINT AWAY
FROM LOSING

373
00:17:36,139 --> 00:17:37,766
AND US FROM WINNING?

374
00:17:37,850 --> 00:17:39,601
UM ALEX, CAN I TALK TO YOU?

375
00:17:39,685 --> 00:17:41,812
WE'VE BEEN OVER THE CONCEPT
OF "GOING ALONE" BEFORE.

376
00:17:41,895 --> 00:17:42,604
TALK TO MARCO.

377
00:17:42,688 --> 00:17:45,274
I'M SURE HE'LL CLARIFY THINGS
AGAIN.

378
00:17:45,357 --> 00:17:48,277
ARE YOU A 100% SURE OF YOUR
HAND, ALEX?

379
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:49,152
THOUSAND.

380

THAT'S MY RENT MONEY.

384
00:17:55,993 --> 00:17:58,370
YOU'RE BUGGING ME, ELLIE.

385
00:17:58,453 --> 00:18:00,289
YOU KNOW,
WE'LL JUST FORGET THIS HAND.

386
00:18:00,372 --> 00:18:01,248
CAN I HAVE THE CARDS?

387
00:18:01,331 --> 00:18:02,624

(KNOCKS ON DOOR)

393
00:18:34,323 --> 00:18:37,201
WHY AREN'T YOU ANSWERING
YOUR PHONE?

394
00:18:37,284 --> 00:18:38,452
WHO'S IS IN THERE
WITH YOU?

395
00:18:38,535 --> 00:18:41,246
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE,
PAIGE?

396
00:18:41,330 --> 00:18:42,414
DON'T- PAIGE!

397
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:47,961
(WATER DRIPS)

398
00:18:53,842 --> 00:18:55,093
GUY UPSTAIRS
FLUSHED HIS TOILET

399
00:18:55,177 --> 00:18:57,221
THROUGH MY CEILING...

400
00:18:57,804 --> 00:19:00,724
FOR THE THIRD TIME
THIS YEAR.

401
00:19:01,517 --> 00:19:05,729
I WOULD'VE CALLED
BUT THEY'VE CUTOFF MY SERVICE.

402
00:19:05,812 --> 00:19:07,231
THIS IS YOUR APARTMENT?

403
00:19:07,314 --> 00:19:08,148
YUP.

404
00:19:09,483 --> 00:19:10,275
YOU WANT THE TOUR?

405
00:19:10,359 --> 00:19:13,695
WE CAN BEGIN AND END
IN THE FOYER.

406
00:19:15,864 --> 00:19:17,866
I THOUGHT YOU WERE
WITH SOMEONE?

407
00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:20,369
IS THAT THE KIND OF GUY
YOU THINK I AM?

408
00:19:20,452 --> 00:19:23,580
I DON'T KNOW, MATT.
I SEE YOU IN CLASS

409
00:19:23,664 --> 00:19:25,374
OR AT THE WATER FOUNTAIN

410
00:19:25,457 --> 00:19:27,042
OR AT YOGA,
BUT BEYOND THAT-

411
00:19:27,125 --> 00:19:28,752
THAT'S WET.

412
00:19:28,836 --> 00:19:31,171
THE TOILET'S ABOVE IT.

413
00:19:32,589 --> 00:19:36,426
LOOK BEYOND THAT
I'M A STUDENT LIKE YOU.

414
00:19:37,052 --> 00:19:40,722
EXCEPT I LIVE
IN A PIT-HOLE APARTMENT.

415
00:19:42,015 --> 00:19:42,516
THERE...

416
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:46,395
ALL THE GLAMOUR THIS
RELATIONSHIP EVER HAD -

417
00:19:46,478 --> 00:19:47,396
GONE.

418
00:19:52,276 --> 00:19:54,778
YOU SAID "RELATIONSHIP",

419
00:19:55,362 --> 00:19:57,155
WHICH MEANS...

420
00:19:57,239 --> 00:19:58,907
I GET TO STAY.

421
00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:02,411
(KISS)

422
00:20:06,039 --> 00:20:06,999
(KNOCK AT THE DOOR)

423
00:20:07,082 --> 00:20:08,375
IT'S OPEN.

(DOOR OPENS)

425
00:20:10,878 --> 00:20:14,047
IT'S THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT,
ELLIE.

426
00:20:14,131 --> 00:20:15,883
THERE'S NO EMERGENCY?

427
00:20:16,383 --> 00:20:18,385
I HAD TO BE SURE
OF SOMETHING.

428
00:20:18,468 --> 00:20:20,095
SURE OF WHAT?

429
00:20:20,179 --> 00:20:22,264
THAT YOU COULD COME OVER.

430
00:20:22,764 --> 00:20:26,226
THAT YOU WERE SOBER,
YOU WEREN'T DRUNK.

431
00:20:26,310 --> 00:20:28,395
YOU WOKE ME AS A TEST?

432
00:20:31,481 --> 00:20:34,193
I WROTE A LETTER
TO MR. MARTIN.

433
00:20:34,276 --> 00:20:37,905
IT SAYS I'M GIVING
TWO MONTHS NOTICE.

434
00:20:38,405 --> 00:20:40,824
OH SO YOU'RE COMING HOME!

435
00:20:40,908 --> 00:20:41,575
I...

436
00:20:42,534 --> 00:20:43,452
I SAID I WROTE IT.

437
00:20:43,535 --> 00:20:46,747
MOM, I-
I HAVEN'T GIVEN IT TO HIM.

438
00:20:46,830 --> 00:20:47,956
NOT YET.

439
00:20:49,583 --> 00:20:51,752
BUT YOU'RE GOING TO?

440
00:20:52,503 --> 00:20:53,921
NO MORE DRINKING?

441
00:20:57,299 --> 00:20:59,635
THE BEST I CAN DO IS TRY.

442
00:20:59,718 --> 00:21:01,637
DAY BY DAY - TRY.

443
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:08,435
THEN PROMISE ME THAT YOU'LL
TRY AND MAKE IT EASY FOR ME

444
00:21:08,519 --> 00:21:10,145
TO TRUST YOU AGAIN.

445
00:21:17,819 --> 00:21:19,196
COME HOME, ELLIE.

446
00:21:20,822 --> 00:21:22,866
I'M TIRED OF BEING ALONE.

447
00:21:24,034 --> 00:21:24,451
YEAH.

448
00:21:27,329 --> 00:21:27,996
ME TOO.
