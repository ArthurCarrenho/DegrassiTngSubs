00:07:52,347 --> 00:07:52,848
STILL.

181
00:07:53,515 --> 00:07:54,808
IT ISN'T ROCKET SCIENCE,

182
00:07:54,892 --> 00:07:55,475
OKAY?

183
00:07:55,559 --> 00:07:58,228
TALK TO ASHLEY.
GET HER ALONE.

184
00:07:58,979 --> 00:08:02,566
WELL, HER HOUSE
IS FULL OF WEDDING.

185
00:08:02,649 --> 00:08:03,442
CAITLIN'S PAINTING,

186
00:08:03,525 --> 00:08:06,904
SO MY PLACE LOOKS LIKE
A DISASTER FLICK.

187
00:08:06,987 --> 00:08:07,487
SO WHAT,

188
00:08:07,571 --> 00:08:08,280
YOU WANT ME TO SEE

189
00:08:08,363 --> 00:08:11,533
IF THEY HAVE
ANY VACANCIES HERE?

190
00:08:11,617 --> 00:08:12,951
VACANCIES...

191
00:08:14,411 --> 00:08:16,246
LIKE AT A HOTEL.

192
00:08:21,293 --> 00:08:22,920
ANGELA:
MORE PIZZA.

193
00:08:24,838 --> 00:08:26,006
JOEY:
AH CRAIG...

194
00:08:26,089 --> 00:08:27,341
PIZZA FOR DINNER.
AGAIN.

195
00:08:27,424 --> 00:08:28,008
NO THANKS,

196
00:08:28,091 --> 00:08:29,635
BUT YOU KNOW
WHAT I COULD USE?

197
00:08:29,718 --> 00:08:30,469
I HAVE NO MONEY.

198
00:08:30,552 --> 00:08:31,887
BUT YOU HAVE
A CREDIT CARD.

199
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:33,013
IF YOU PAINT EVERY ROOM
IN THE HOUSE,

200
00:08:33,096 --> 00:08:34,056
I'LL SIGN OVER MINE.

201
00:08:34,139 --> 00:08:35,849
CRAIG:
LOOK, I HAVE THE MONEY
TO PAY YOU UP FRONT.

202
00:08:35,933 --> 00:08:38,060
AND I'D ONLY BE BORROWING IT
FOR ONE NIGHT.

203
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:38,769
PLEASE.

204
00:08:41,104 --> 00:08:43,357
CRAIG, YOU SKIPPED
CLASS TODAY.

205
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,191
SCHOOL DOES CALL.

206
00:08:44,274 --> 00:08:45,359
I WENT TO VISIT JIMMY

207
00:08:45,442 --> 00:08:46,401
ON A STUDY PERIOD.

208
00:08:46,485 --> 00:08:50,030
WHAT DOES IT HAVE TO DO
WITH ME BORROWING YOUR CARD?

209
00:08:50,113 --> 00:08:51,156
WHAT DO YOU NEED IT
SO BADLY FOR?

210
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:51,990
ARE YOU RENTING
SOMETHING?

211
00:08:52,699 --> 00:08:54,243
JOEY, CAN YOU HELP WITH THIS?

212
00:08:54,326 --> 00:08:55,244
JOEY:
OKAY.

213
00:08:55,327 --> 00:08:55,869
CRAIG, NO.

214
00:08:55,953 --> 00:08:57,037
I'M NOT LENDING YOU
MY CARD.

215
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,039
AND SKIPPING A STUDY PERIOD
IS STILL SKIPPING.

216
00:08:59,122 --> 00:09:01,041
DON'T DO IT AGAIN.

217
00:09:10,259 --> 00:09:12,010
I DIDN'T EVEN
SEE THAT!

218
00:09:21,812 --> 00:09:22,813
PIZZA!

219
00:09:28,735 --> 00:09:31,905
SALLY:
TALL, DARK AND HOPELESSLY LOST?

220
00:09:31,989 --> 00:09:33,490
YOU MUST BE CRAIG.

221
00:09:34,491 --> 00:09:36,118
I'M SALLY.

222
00:09:36,201 --> 00:09:37,828
ASHLEY'S AUNT.

223
00:09:37,911 --> 00:09:39,746
MY BROTHER'S GONNA BE
MARRYING HER DAD.

224
00:09:42,332 --> 00:09:45,711
COME BACK LATER,
I'LL HAVE CHARTS.

225
00:09:47,129 --> 00:09:48,589
HAVE YOU SEEN ASHLEY?

226
00:09:48,672 --> 00:09:49,339
SALLY:
YOU KNOW,

227
00:09:49,423 --> 00:09:51,675
CHRISTOPHER TOLD ME
ALL ABOUT YOU.

228
00:09:51,758 --> 00:09:53,260
WHICH VERSION?

229
00:09:53,343 --> 00:09:54,469
DID I HAVE HORNS
IN THAT ONE?

230
00:09:54,553 --> 00:09:56,889
MAYBE A LONG,
POINTY TAIL?

231
00:09:56,972 --> 00:09:58,891
YOU MEAN
YOU'RE DIFFERENT NOW?

232
00:09:58,974 --> 00:09:59,892
DARN.

233
00:10:00,851 --> 00:10:03,020
LOOK, I HURT ASHLEY.

234
00:10:04,479 --> 00:10:06,565
AND THE FACT SHE'S EVEN
WILLING TO EVEN LOOK AT ME?

235
00:10:06,648 --> 00:10:07,399
I'M NOT SCREWING
THAT UP AGAIN.

236
00:10:07,482 --> 00:10:09,568
SO YOU CAN FLIRT WITH ME,

237
00:10:09,651 --> 00:10:11,195
AND PEOPLE CAN SAY
WHATEVER,

238
00:10:11,278 --> 00:10:13,113
BUT THAT FACT IS

239
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:15,782
I LOVE YOUR NIECE.

240
00:10:17,367 --> 00:10:21,580
ASHLEY:
THOUGHT YOU ONLY SAID
THAT AT AIRPORTS?

241
00:10:21,663 --> 00:10:22,706
I'M NOT STAYING
HERE LONG.

242
00:10:22,789 --> 00:10:25,709
I JUST CAME TO GIVE
YOU THIS.

243
00:10:26,585 --> 00:10:28,670
IT'S A HOTEL ROOM KEY.

244
00:10:28,754 --> 00:10:30,297
IT'S FOR LATER.

245
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:32,883
IF YOU NEED
A PLACE TO GO.

246
00:10:32,966 --> 00:10:35,719
KATE:
ASHLEY, I MADE IT CLEAR.

247
00:10:35,802 --> 00:10:37,846
THERE IS NO ROOM
FOR EXTRA GUESTS,

248
00:10:37,930 --> 00:10:40,098
ESPECIALLY UNINVITED ONES.

249
00:10:42,226 --> 00:10:45,062
ASHLEY:
JUST SHOWING HIM OUT, MOM.

250
00:10:48,815 --> 00:10:50,734
OKAY.
NO PEEKING.

251
00:10:53,362 --> 00:10:55,656
STAND RIGHT HERE.

252
00:10:55,739 --> 00:10:56,865
NOW THIS WAS
SUPPOSED TO BE

253
00:10:56,949 --> 00:10:58,575
FOR AFTER
THE REHEARSAL PARTY,

254
00:10:58,659 --> 00:10:59,493
BUT...

255
00:11:02,454 --> 00:11:03,872
OKAY, OPEN.

256
00:11:11,672 --> 00:11:14,216
CRAIG,
THIS IS KINDA PERFECT.

257
00:11:14,299 --> 00:11:16,009
NO MORE ANNOYING
FRIENDS,

258
00:11:16,093 --> 00:11:17,886
BULLYING TEACHERS,

259
00:11:17,970 --> 00:11:19,221
SHRIEKING PARENTS,

260
00:11:19,304 --> 00:11:20,264
OR HORNY AUNTS.

261
00:11:25,686 --> 00:11:28,105
YOU GOT A ROOM
WITH TWO BEDS.

262
00:11:29,606 --> 00:11:31,108
THERE'S TWO OF US.

263
00:11:32,693 --> 00:11:33,110
WELL...

264
00:11:35,153 --> 00:11:37,322
WHAT IF WE ONLY NEEDED ONE BED?

265
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:39,408
ONE BED?

266
00:11:41,201 --> 00:11:41,869
YEAH WELL,
YOU KNOW,

267
00:11:41,952 --> 00:11:43,996
IF YOU BROUGHT SOMETHING.

268
00:11:51,753 --> 00:11:53,046
NEVER AGAIN
WILL I BE WITHOUT.

269
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:56,258
THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR DOING THIS.

270
00:11:58,886 --> 00:12:00,554
I LOVE YOU.

271
00:12:00,637 --> 00:12:02,723
AND THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR SAYING THAT.

272
00:12:02,806 --> 00:12:05,392
PERFECT.
I LOVE YOU TOO.

CRAIG:
SALVADOR KOVACK?

274
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:15,027
KILLER RAGE TWO?

275
00:12:16,278 --> 00:12:18,322
OH, HOW ABOUT ELIMINATION
ROUND THREE?

276
00:12:18,405 --> 00:12:19,698
(SOBBING)

277
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,658
I'M SORRY.

278
00:12:22,367 --> 00:12:26,330
FOR WHATEVER I DID,
I INSTANTLY APOLOGIZE.

279
00:12:26,872 --> 00:12:28,123
HEY, HEY, LOOK!

280
00:12:28,207 --> 00:12:29,333

281
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:32,586
WE GOT JUJUBES -
I THINK THEY'RE BRITISH.

282
00:12:32,669 --> 00:12:34,880
BELGIAN CHOCOLATES?
MAYBE CHIPS?

283
00:12:34,963 --> 00:12:35,714
(SOBBING)

284
00:12:37,508 --> 00:12:38,800
MAYBE NOT.

285
00:12:38,884 --> 00:12:40,511
HEY, HEY, ASH.

286
00:12:43,222 --> 00:12:44,848
ASHLEY:
I'M SORRY.

287
00:12:46,266 --> 00:12:47,893
I'M HAPPY, REALLY.

288
00:12:48,894 --> 00:12:51,480
JUST... I DON'T KNOW,
I'M OVERWHELMED.

289
00:12:52,814 --> 00:12:54,024
KEEP TALKING.
PLEASE.

290
00:12:54,107 --> 00:12:54,691
OKAY.

291
00:12:54,775 --> 00:12:57,402
SO LET'S JUST...
LET'S JUST TAKE OFF.

292
00:12:59,112 --> 00:13:01,782
GET AN APARTMENT -
ANYWHERE.

293
00:13:01,865 --> 00:13:03,200
VANCOUVER.

294
00:13:03,742 --> 00:13:05,077
I HATE TO LEAVE YOU.

295
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:06,662
SO DON'T LEAVE ME.

296
00:13:06,745 --> 00:13:07,996
ASHLEY:
I HAVE TO GO TO MY DAD'S.

297
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:10,749
WHY?
I HAVE FOOD HERE.

298
00:13:10,832 --> 00:13:12,334
HE'S MY DAD.

299
00:13:12,417 --> 00:13:14,461
BUT I'M YOUR CRAIG.

300
00:13:17,422 --> 00:13:19,091
YEAH.
YOU ARE.

301
00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:23,303
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?

302
00:13:23,387 --> 00:13:24,888
YOU'RE JUST AS IMPORTANT
TO ME AS HE IS.

303
00:13:24,972 --> 00:13:26,431
SO GET DRESSED.

304
00:13:26,515 --> 00:13:28,851
YOU'RE COMING WITH ME.

305
00:13:30,561 --> 00:13:32,145
THERE SHE IS.

00:13:51,623 --> 00:13:53,709
WE THOUGHT WE'D NEED TO SET
THE THING AROUND A CHARACTER;

SOMEBODY WHO'S BEEN

363
00:16:25,068 --> 00:16:29,072
AND I SO, SO WISH
THAT DIDN'T JUST HAPPEN.

364
00:16:31,742 --> 00:16:34,161
I HAVE TO LEAVE

365
00:16:34,244 --> 00:16:34,953
WHAT? WHY?

366
00:16:35,037 --> 00:16:35,913
A HALF-HOUR.

367
00:16:35,996 --> 00:16:37,748
JUST STAY HERE.

368
00:16:52,804 --> 00:16:56,808
♪ WHAT I KNOW
IS THAT I HURT YOU, OH... ♪

CAITLIN:

A LOUNGE GIG?

00:17:08,779 --> 00:17:10,113
SUIT'S FOR THE WEDDING.

WHAT WAS I THINKING BEFORE?

378
00:17:22,751 --> 00:17:24,920
CHEATING ON HER WITH MANNY?

379
00:17:25,003 --> 00:17:26,588
WHY DID I DO THAT?

380
00:17:29,383 --> 00:17:30,509
PEOPLE MAKE MISTAKES.

381
00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:34,513

389
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:05,294
IT WAS MY MOTHER'S.

390
00:18:05,377 --> 00:18:08,088
SO IT'S YOUR
MOTHER'S RING?

391
00:18:11,675 --> 00:18:14,595
WHY ARE YOU DOWN
ON ONE KNEE?

392
00:18:17,472 --> 00:18:19,474
WILL YOU MARRY ME?

393
00:18:21,768 --> 00:18:23,520
I-I'M SORRY,
I CAN'T.

394
00:18:25,063 --> 00:18:27,983
NO. I ACTUALLY WANT YOU
TO MARRY ME?

HOW ABOUT PUTTING "DRACULA"
IN DEGRASSI?

00:19:04,770 --> 00:19:06,563
HE TURNS THE TEACHERS
INTO VAMPIRES,

401
00:19:06,647 --> 00:19:08,649
SAVING RADITCH FOR LAST.

413
00:19:29,711 --> 00:19:33,048

A MUSICAL WITHOUT ANY SONGS.

OF THE CONVERSATION WE HAD.

SO YOU'RE
STILL TOGETHER?

00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:38,906
I SAID MORE LIKE NO.

440
00:20:39,489 --> 00:20:41,450

YOU LOVED HIM.

441
00:20:41,533 --> 00:20:42,534
I DO.

442
00:20:44,119 --> 00:20:45,787
