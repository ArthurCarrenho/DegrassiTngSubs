1
00:00:02,169 --> 00:00:04,338
OKAY.

2
00:00:04,421 --> 00:00:07,633
TELL ME WHAT I NEED TO DO TO
SAVE MY PERFECTLY TONED BEHIND.

3
00:00:07,716 --> 00:00:09,676
LAWYER:
ZOE, WE'RE PREPARING
FOR YOUR PRELIMINARY HEARING.

4
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:11,678
LAWYER: BE SERIOUS.
ZOE: I AM.

5
00:00:11,762 --> 00:00:13,764
BUT I CAME FORWARD
ABOUT DEGRASSI NUDES

6
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:16,350
AND I ADMITTED TO WHAT I DID.

7
00:00:16,433 --> 00:00:18,060
PLUS, I'M A RECENT VICTIM
OF SEXUAL ASSAULT.

8
00:00:18,143 --> 00:00:19,686
WON'T THAT ALL WORK
IN MY FAVOUR?

9
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:20,854
LAWYER:
YES, BUT THERE'S NO WAY
THE JUDGE WILL DISMISS

10
00:00:20,938 --> 00:00:22,773
THIS CASE COMPLETELY.

11
00:00:22,856 --> 00:00:24,608
ZOE:
OKAY. WHAT DO I NEED TO DO?

12
00:00:24,691 --> 00:00:27,069
WORK ON YOUR PERSONAL
STATEMENT. SHOW REMORSE.

13
00:00:27,152 --> 00:00:29,279
AND GET A HEAD-START
AT COMMUNITY SERVICE.

14
00:00:29,363 --> 00:00:30,948
I'LL ARRANGE IT
AT YOUR SCHOOL,

15
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:32,032
SO YOU'LL BE SEEN TO BE
GIVING BACK

16
00:00:32,115 --> 00:00:34,034
TO THE COMMUNITY
YOU WRONGED.

17
00:00:34,117 --> 00:00:35,661
A HUNDRED HOURS
SHOULD DO.

18
00:00:35,744 --> 00:00:38,205
A HUNDRED HOURS?!
ISN'T THAT A BIT HARSH?

19
00:00:38,288 --> 00:00:39,623
IT'S NOT LIKE I KILLED ANYONE.

20
00:00:39,706 --> 00:00:41,667
THAT'S NOT YOUR PUNISHMENT.

21
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:42,876
THAT'S JUST TO SHOW THE JUDGE
YOU'RE REPENTANT,

22
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,087
SO SHE'LL SHOW LENIENCY.

23
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:46,463
SO THE PUNISHMENT
COULD BE WORSE?

24
00:00:46,547 --> 00:00:47,840
THE SENTENCING WON'T BE
FOR A FEW MONTHS,

25
00:00:47,923 --> 00:00:49,758
BUT REALISTICALLY,

26
00:00:49,842 --> 00:00:52,636
IT COULD BE AS HIGH
AS FIVE YEARS.
