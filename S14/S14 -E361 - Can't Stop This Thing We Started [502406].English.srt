00:07:25,028 --> 00:07:26,613
WHEN WERE YOU GOING TO TELL ME?

176
00:07:26,697 --> 00:07:28,198
ONCE I FIGURED OUT WHAT TO DO.

177
00:07:28,282 --> 00:07:30,117
ON YOUR OWN?!

178
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:32,286
YOU'RE STILL A KID!

179
00:07:32,369 --> 00:07:33,871
YOU CAN'T HANDLE THIS
ON YOUR OWN,

180
00:07:33,954 --> 00:07:37,583
I DON'T WANT YOU TO HANDLE
THIS ON YOUR OWN!

181
00:07:37,666 --> 00:07:39,751
HONEY, I'M HERE FOR YOU,
ALWAYS.

182
00:07:42,379 --> 00:07:44,715
WE'LL FIGURE THIS OUT
AS A FAMILY, OKAY?

183
00:07:47,384 --> 00:07:49,386
OH...I DON'T WANT
THIS LIFE FOR YOU.

184
00:07:52,347 --> 00:07:55,601
MOM, THIS CHANGES NOTHING.

185
00:07:55,684 --> 00:07:58,270
I CAN STILL HAVE ALL
THE SAME THINGS.

186
00:07:58,353 --> 00:08:00,230
I'M STILL THE SAME PERSON!

187
00:08:00,314 --> 00:08:02,316
I'M CLARE EDWARDS!

188
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:04,318
CLARE EDWARDS ALWAYS
HAS A PLAN.

189
00:08:04,401 --> 00:08:07,321
TRUST ME.

(DOORBELL RINGS)

191
00:08:14,953 --> 00:08:16,997
AREN'T YOU GONNA APOLOGIZE
FOR GETTING ME DETENTION?

192
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,332
THAT'S WHAT THE POUTINE IS FOR.

193
00:08:18,415 --> 00:08:19,499
TINY:
HMM!

194
00:08:21,335 --> 00:08:22,836
THEN, APOLOGY ACCEPTED.

195

(ZIG LAUGHS)

196
00:08:24,922 --> 00:08:27,257
SO WHAT DO YOU SAY, GRACE?
REMATCH?

197
00:08:27,341 --> 00:08:29,092
WHY WOULD I RISK MY TITLE?

198
00:08:29,176 --> 00:08:31,678
BECAUSE OUR LITTLE ZIGMUND
IS FEELING EMASCULATED.

199
00:08:31,762 --> 00:08:33,764
HE WANTS ANOTHER CHANCE TO
PROVE WHAT A MAN HE REALLY IS.

200
00:08:33,847 --> 00:08:35,849
I WANT TINY TO TAKE DOWN
THAT GIF.

201
00:08:35,933 --> 00:08:37,518
THEN YOU NEED TO PROVE
YOU'RE NOT A WUSS.

202
00:08:37,601 --> 00:08:40,354
HOW AM I GONNA DO THAT IF SHE
WON'T AGREE TO ROUND TWO?

203
00:08:40,437 --> 00:08:42,564
GRACE:
I'VE GOT AN IDEA.

204
00:08:42,648 --> 00:08:43,732
UNLESS YOU'RE SCARED.

205
00:08:45,359 --> 00:08:47,528
OF WHAT?

206
00:08:47,611 --> 00:08:48,529
GRACE:
I THINK I'LL KEEP IT
A SURPRISE.

207
00:08:48,612 --> 00:08:49,988
IT'S MORE FUN LIKE THAT.

I'VE ALREADY CONSIDERED
MY OPTIONS,

212
00:09:03,126 --> 00:09:04,962
I'M KEEPING THE BABY.

213
00:09:05,045 --> 00:09:07,172
SO, YOU'RE GONNA RUIN
YOUR LIFE AND DREW'S?

214
00:09:07,256 --> 00:09:09,258
WATCH YOUR TONE.

215
00:09:09,341 --> 00:09:11,468
THIS IS MY DAUGHTER
YOU'RE TALKING TO.

216
00:09:11,552 --> 00:09:13,887
I JUST THINK SHE SHOULD
CONSIDER WHAT SHE'S GIVING UP!

217
00:09:13,971 --> 00:09:15,430
HOW IS SHE POSSIBLY
GONNA MANAGE UNIVERSITY?

218
00:09:15,514 --> 00:09:18,058
I'LL HELP HER OUT.

GREAT DAYCARE,
I'VE LOOKED INTO IT.

222

SO YOU'RE GONNA HAVE THIS BABY,

223
00:09:27,526 --> 00:09:30,195
AND THEN MOVE IT
OUT OF THE COUNTRY?!

224
00:09:30,279 --> 00:09:31,905
DID YOU KNOW THIS?

225
00:09:31,989 --> 00:09:33,699
IT'S WHAT SHE WANTS.

IT'S AN IVY LEAGUE SCHOOL!

227
00:09:35,617 --> 00:09:36,785
IT'LL BE HARD ENOUGH
WITHOUT A BABY,

228
00:09:36,869 --> 00:09:38,745
YOU NEED YOUR FAMILY
AROUND YOU.

SERIOUSLY,
I'M NOT SUBSIDIZING

234

THIS DELUSIONAL
GIRL'S EDUCATION,

235
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,218
IF IT'S NOT EVEN MY GRANDKID!

236
00:09:53,302 --> 00:09:57,181
I AM NOT DELUSIONAL!
A COUPLE MONTHS AGO,

237
00:09:57,264 --> 00:10:00,225
I THOUGHT I MIGHT NEVER
GET TO HAVE CHILDREN.

238
00:10:00,309 --> 00:10:04,104
AND THE CANCER MIGHT STILL
COME BACK.

239
00:10:04,188 --> 00:10:06,315
THIS MIGHT BE MY ONLY CHANCE,
I AM KEEPING THE BABY!

240
00:10:08,984 --> 00:10:11,820
FINE,
BUT WE NEED A NEW PLAN.

241
00:10:11,904 --> 00:10:14,823

WHERE YOU HAVE SUPPORT.

242
00:10:14,907 --> 00:10:17,159
OBVIOUSLY, DREW WILL HELP
AS MUCH AS HE CAN.

243
00:10:17,242 --> 00:10:19,536
WE'LL MAKE A ROOM IN OUR HOME
FOR THE BABY.

HELEN:
JAKE'S ROOM'S FREE,

245
00:10:21,121 --> 00:10:23,290
I THOUGHT THAT COULD BE
THE NURSERY.

TO TALK TO ALLI, SOMEONE WHO
ACTUALLY SUPPORTS ME!

256

IN THERE!

ALL RIGHT, I TRIED TO CALL YOU,
YOU DIDN'T ANSWER!

262
00:11:00,244 --> 00:11:02,704
BECAUSE I WAS GETTING READY
TO TELL ELI!

00:13:22,219 --> 00:13:24,471
THERE'S A WAY I CAN HAVE
THIS BABY AND GO TO COLUMBIA!

326

CAN YOU PLEASE TELL CLARE
THAT WE CAN'T EVEN BEGIN

327
00:13:26,223 --> 00:13:27,140
TO KNOW WHAT HAVING A BABY
WILL BE LIKE,

328
00:13:27,224 --> 00:13:29,184
UNTIL WE ACTUALLY HAVE ONE!
