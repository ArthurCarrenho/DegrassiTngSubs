"YOU MAY FEEL THE CANDIDATES
DON'T TAKE YOU SERIOUSLY

00:00:07,758 --> 00:00:10,761

YOU'RE THE HASHTAG-FUTURE."

4
00:00:10,844 --> 00:00:13,305
(LAUGHING)
YOU CAN'T SAY HASHTAG.

5
00:00:13,388 --> 00:00:14,473
MR. HOLLINGSWORTH:
I JUST WANT TO RELATE TO THE
TEENS AT THE YOUNG VOTERS FORUM.

6
00:00:14,556 --> 00:00:16,016
DON'T TRY TO SOUND COOL.

7
00:00:16,099 --> 00:00:17,976
IF YOU TRY,
YOU JUST SEEM NERDY.

8
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:19,019
MR. HOLLINGSWORTH:
SO, NO "EPIC FAIL," EITHER?

(LAUGHING)

10
00:00:20,854 --> 00:00:22,397

MAYBE WE SHOULD FIRE ANDREA

00:00:27,194 --> 00:00:28,278
I WOULDN'T BLAME YOU.

15
00:00:28,362 --> 00:00:30,280
(COUGHS) KISS-ASS.

16
00:00:30,364 --> 00:00:31,990
OKAY, DAILY BRIEFING TIME?

17
00:00:32,074 --> 00:00:34,284
WHAT'S THE PRESS GOING
TO HECKLE ME WITH TODAY?

18
00:00:34,368 --> 00:00:36,453
ANDREA:
THEY MAY ASK YOU ABOUT THE
OOMFCHAT CHEERLEADING SCANDAL.

19
00:00:36,537 --> 00:00:38,664
MR. HOLLINGSWORTH:
(LAUGHING)

20
00:00:38,747 --> 00:00:40,582
HUNTER:
IT'S THIS APP THAT
SENDS PICTURES

21
00:00:40,666 --> 00:00:42,793
THAT DISAPPEAR
IN ONE TO TEN SECONDS.

22
00:00:42,876 --> 00:00:44,378
MR. HOLLINGSWORTH:
AND WHY ON EARTH WOULD ANYONE
WANT THAT?

23
00:00:44,461 --> 00:00:46,713
MILES:
TO SEND BOOB-SHOTS.

24
00:00:46,797 --> 00:00:48,799
WHAT?

25
00:00:48,882 --> 00:00:50,717
THAT'S WHAT THE CHEERLEADERS
WERE DOING FOR MONEY.

26
00:00:52,886 --> 00:00:54,555
DID YOU KNOW ABOUT THIS,
FRANKIE?

27
00:00:54,638 --> 00:00:57,307
NO! NO, IT'S JUST A RUMOUR.

28
00:00:57,391 --> 00:00:59,643
I'M PRETTY SURE.
I MEAN, IT SEEMS CRAZY.

29
00:00:59,726 --> 00:01:01,228

I DUNNO... ARLENE SAW
SOME SCREENSHOTS

30
00:01:01,311 --> 00:01:03,230
WITH SOME PRETTY RECOGNIZABLE
BIRTHMARKS.

31
00:01:03,313 --> 00:01:05,983
FRANKIE:
ALSO, I QUIT CHEERLEADING,
A LONG TIME AGO, REMEMBER?

32
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:07,442
MR. HOLLINGSWORTH:
YEAH, YEAH, OF COURSE I DO.

33
00:01:07,526 --> 00:01:09,403
BECAUSE YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE

OKAY, I DID IT ONCE,
BUT THEN I QUIT.

00:01:35,053 --> 00:01:37,181
WHAT DO I DO?

45
00:01:37,264 --> 00:01:39,850
ALL RIGHT, HAVE YOU LEARNED
NOTHING FROM DAD'S POLITICAL
MANEUVERING?

46
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:42,186
YOU JUST NEED A SCAPEGOAT.

47
00:01:42,269 --> 00:01:43,770
GIVE THEM SOMEONE TO BLAME.

FIGURE IT OUT SOON.

I THOUGHT WE'D BE WADING
INTO THE WILD WORLD
OF THE LIQUIDS TODAY,

110
00:04:18,342 --> 00:04:19,968
BUT HAVING STUDENTS PULLED OUT
FOR QUESTIONING

111
00:04:20,052 --> 00:04:21,720
WILL BE TOO DISRUPTIVE.

INSTEAD.

I CAN KEEP IT UP!

THEY WANT TO BOOT US
FROM REGIONALS.

WE'RE SORRY WE LET ZOE
BULLY YOU.

00:04:44,076 --> 00:04:44,993
WE DIDN'T KNOW
WHAT ELSE TO DO.

121
00:04:45,494 --> 00:04:49,498
WELL, I DO.

122
00:04:49,581 --> 00:04:52,209
WE GET ZOE TO ADMIT
SHE CAME UP WITH DEGRASSI NUDES
AND MADE US ALL DO IT.

123
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:53,627

YOU WANT US TO TURN ON ZOE?

124
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:55,087
YOU'D RATHER WE ALL GO DOWN?

WE JUST NEED TO KEEP QUIET.

BUT US HAS ANY REAL PROOF.

127
00:04:59,174 --> 00:05:02,219
WHAT ABOUT THIS BLACKMAILER?

128
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:03,679
ZOE SAYS THE SYSTEM
WAS AIRTIGHT.

129
00:05:03,762 --> 00:05:05,889
WHAT IF SHE'S WRONG?

130
00:05:05,973 --> 00:05:06,849
HOW LONG DO YOU THINK
YOU'LL GET GROUNDED

131
00:05:06,932 --> 00:05:09,017
FOR SELLING NAKED PICTURES?

132
00:05:09,101 --> 00:05:10,853
I CAN'T EVEN COUNT THAT HIGH.

133
00:05:10,936 --> 00:05:12,980
IF ZOE DOESN'T TAKE THE BLAME,
WE ALL GO DOWN.

MRS. BAKER:
GIRLS FROM OUR CHILDREN'S
SCHOOL

135
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:20,654
ARE SENDING NAKED PICTURES
FOR MONEY,

THE CHEERLEADERS,

139
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:30,539

I THINK THESE GIRLS ARE
INNOCENT UNTIL PROVEN GUILTY.

144
00:05:43,135 --> 00:05:45,470
IF WE SHUT DOWN EVERY TEAM
BECAUSE OF EVERY RUMOUR,

145
00:05:45,554 --> 00:05:48,182
THEN WE WOULD HAVE NONE
OF THOSE BANNERS HANGING
IN THE GYM.

146

MRS. BAKER:
BUT IT WAS MOST LIKELY SOMEONE
FROM DEGRASSI.

147
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:52,644
IS THIS SCHOOL SAFE
FOR OUR DAUGHTERS, ANYMORE?

148
00:05:52,728 --> 00:05:55,022
SAFE AS ANY.

149
00:05:55,105 --> 00:05:56,231

00:06:40,609 --> 00:06:42,486
I DON'T MAKE A HABIT OF GIVING
MY NUMBER TO STRANGE GUYS.

167
00:06:42,569 --> 00:06:45,739
SORRY.

168
00:06:45,822 --> 00:06:47,783
ZIG:
(SIGHS) ALL RIGHT,
BATTER UP.

169
00:06:47,866 --> 00:06:49,618
GLORIA:
WHAT WAS THAT?

170
00:06:49,701 --> 00:06:52,412
(JUICE SPLASHES AND DRIPS)

171
00:06:52,496 --> 00:06:55,791
I AM SO SORRY.

172
00:06:55,874 --> 00:06:58,126
ZIG:
(SIGHS) IT'S NOTHING.

173
00:07:03,382 --> 00:07:05,175
GLORIA: LET ME HELP.
ZIG: SHOULDN'T YOU BE GETTING
READY FOR REGIONALS?

174
00:07:05,259 --> 00:07:07,302
AT LEAST LET ME TREAT IT
SO THE STAIN WON'T SET.

175
00:07:07,386 --> 00:07:10,055
WOW. THAT'S SO NICE OF YOU.

176
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:15,978
♪ Oh oh-oh-oh yeah! ♪

177
00:07:16,061 --> 00:07:18,981
♪ Come on and feel it! ♪

178
00:07:21,275 --> 00:07:22,442
ZOE:
ARE YOU FREAKING KIDDING ME?!

179
00:07:22,526 --> 00:07:24,111
FRANKIE:
SOMEONE HAS TO TAKE THE BLAME,
ZOE.

180
00:07:24,194 --> 00:07:26,029
SO YOU WANT ME TO MARCH
TO SIMPSON'S OFFICE

181
00:07:26,113 --> 00:07:28,824
AND TELL HIM I RAN
DEGRASSI NUDES ALL BY MYSELF?

182
00:07:28,907 --> 00:07:30,576
SHAY:
WELL, IF YOU FESS UP,

183
00:07:30,659 --> 00:07:32,286
THE REST OF US MAY STILL EVEN
GET A CHANCE TO COMPETE.

184
00:07:32,369 --> 00:07:33,996
GIRL:
YEAH.

185
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:35,914
SO YOU'RE ALL ON BOARD
FOR THIS...

186
00:07:35,998 --> 00:07:38,250
ONE-PERSON-TAKES-ALL-THE-BLAME
IDEA?

187
00:07:43,213 --> 00:07:45,215
OKAY.

188
00:07:47,676 --> 00:07:49,303
I HOPE YOU'RE HAPPY.

189
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:54,016
(DOOR BANGS OPEN)

190
00:07:54,099 --> 00:07:56,185
HOW DID THAT MOM KNOW
ABOUT MY PREGNANCY?

191
00:07:56,268 --> 00:07:57,769
ALLI:
DREW USED TO DATE BECKY.
THAT WAS BECKY'S MOM.

192
00:07:57,853 --> 00:07:59,521
I GUESS THEY'RE CLOSE?

193
00:07:59,605 --> 00:08:01,231
JENNA:
OR SHE HEARD THE RUMOURS.

194
00:08:01,315 --> 00:08:04,318
WHAT RUMOURS?

195
00:08:04,401 --> 00:08:07,863
ALLI:
ABOUT THE STUDENT COUNCIL VP
THAT GOT KNOCKED UP...
BY HER PRESIDENT.

196
00:08:07,946 --> 00:08:10,282
JENNA:
AT A SCHOOL EVENT.

197
00:08:10,365 --> 00:08:13,076
DON'T FORGET THAT PART.

198
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:15,454
OKAY, WHAT? DREW'S, LIKE,
THE HOTTEST GUY IN SCHOOL.

199
00:08:15,537 --> 00:08:18,081
IT'S BIG-TIME GOSSIP!
CLARE: WHAT AM I GONNA DO?

200
00:08:18,165 --> 00:08:20,834
I THOUGHT I COULD MAKE IT
TO GRADUATION WITHOUT
PEOPLE KNOWING.

201
00:08:20,918 --> 00:08:22,711
I CAN'T STAND PEOPLE LOOKING
AT ME LIKE I'M SOME KIND
OF TRASHY TEEN MOM

202
00:08:22,794 --> 00:08:26,048
LIKE THEY DID
WHEN YOU WERE PREGNANT.

203
00:08:26,131 --> 00:08:28,717
JENNA: OUCH.
SIMPSON: CLARE! (CLAPS HANDS)
A MOMENT PLEASE?

204
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:32,012
ALLI:
IF YOU NEED US, WE'LL BE IN
THE STUDENT COUNCIL ROOM.

205
00:08:32,095 --> 00:08:34,389
I AM SO SORRY
ABOUT THAT MEETING.

206
00:08:34,473 --> 00:08:37,351
I HAVE TO ASK,
HOW DOES HOME-SCHOOLING WORK?

207
00:08:37,434 --> 00:08:39,228
CLARE, YOU'RE ONE OF MY BEST
STUDENTS - YOU EXCEL IN A SCHOOL
ENVIRONMENT.

208
00:08:39,311 --> 00:08:41,647
I KNOW, BUT I CAN'T STAND
PEOPLE GAWKING AT ME

209
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:43,357
BECAUSE I'M PREGNANT!

210
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,441
I AM PREGNANT, BY THE WAY.

211
00:08:44,525 --> 00:08:46,527
IT'S GONNA BE OKAY.

212
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:47,778
HOW CAN YOU SAY THAT?

213
00:08:47,861 --> 00:08:51,073
MY WIFE WAS A TEEN MOM.
AT DEGRASSI, ACTUALLY.

214
00:08:51,156 --> 00:08:52,324
HOW DID SHE AVOID
ALL THE RUMOURS?

215
00:08:52,407 --> 00:08:53,367
OH, SHE DIDN'T.
YOU CAN'T.

216
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:55,244
GREAT...

217
00:08:55,327 --> 00:08:56,662
BUT SHE HELD HER HEAD HIGH,
SHE GRADUATED HIGH SCHOOL.

218
00:08:56,745 --> 00:08:58,330
SHE HAS A SOLID CAREER
AS A HAIRDRESSER,

219
00:08:58,413 --> 00:09:01,458
AND SHE EVEN MARRIED
A REALLY HOT GUY.

220
00:09:01,542 --> 00:09:04,878
IT'S... ME. YEAH.

221
00:09:04,962 --> 00:09:07,422
YOU CAN BE A TEEN MOM
AND STILL HAVE A GREAT LIFE,

222
00:09:07,506 --> 00:09:09,299
YOU JUST HAVE TO BE WILLING
TO GO FOR WHAT YOU WANT,

223
00:09:09,383 --> 00:09:10,634
DESPITE WHAT OTHER PEOPLE
MIGHT THINK OF YOU.

224
00:09:19,017 --> 00:09:20,394
FRANKIE:
(SIGHS) PLEASE TELL ME
YOU HAVE THE NAME TAGS

225
00:09:20,477 --> 00:09:21,895
FOR THE YOUNG VOTERS FORUM!

226
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:28,026
GOD, I LOVE YOUR SMILE...

227
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:31,655
WHICH IS WHY I HATE
TO HAVE TO SHOW YOU THIS.

228
00:09:31,738 --> 00:09:35,242
FACERANGE,
POSTED A FEW MINUTES AGO?

229
00:09:35,325 --> 00:09:37,327
IT SAYS I STARTED
THE WHOLE THING,

230
00:09:37,411 --> 00:09:39,288
MADE GIRLS TO DO IT,
AND... TOOK THE MONEY.

231
00:09:39,371 --> 00:09:40,789
NO ONE'S GONNA BELIEVE IT.

232
00:09:40,873 --> 00:09:43,292
BUT WHAT IF THEY DO?
WHAT IF MY DAD SEES THIS?!

233
00:09:43,375 --> 00:09:44,209
YOU DON'T THINK IT WAS
THE BLACKMAILER, DO YOU?

234
00:09:44,293 --> 00:09:45,794
NO. DEFINITELY NOT.

235
00:09:45,878 --> 00:09:47,129
HE ALREADY POSTED THAT THING
ABOUT THE CHEERLEADERS.

236
00:09:47,212 --> 00:09:48,297
BUT IT WASN'T HIM.

237
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:50,340
HOW CAN YOU BE SO SURE?

238
00:09:53,594 --> 00:09:55,345
YOU'RE THE BLACKMAILER?

239
00:09:57,723 --> 00:09:59,308
WINSTON:
I WAS ONLY TRYING TO HELP!

240
00:09:59,391 --> 00:10:00,934
FRANKIE:
HELP?! WITHOUT YOU, NO ONE
WOULD HAVE KNOWN IT WAS THEM.

241
00:10:01,018 --> 00:10:02,519
NO ONE COULD HAVE BLAMED ME!

242
00:10:02,603 --> 00:10:05,022
WINSTON:
WELL, I DIDN'T MEAN
FOR THAT TO HAPPEN.

243
00:10:05,105 --> 00:10:08,984
BECAUSE I SAW HOW SAD YOU WERE
AFTER LOSING CHEERLEADING...

244
00:10:09,067 --> 00:10:10,736
I WANTED TO MAKE ZOE QUIT,
SO YOU COULD TAKE HER SPOT.

245
00:10:10,819 --> 00:10:11,778
HOW COULD YOU DO THIS TO ME?

246
00:10:11,862 --> 00:10:14,990
I DID IT FOR YOU!

247
00:10:15,073 --> 00:10:16,200
OKAY, I DIDN'T MAKE
THAT FACERANGE PAGE.

248
00:10:16,283 --> 00:10:19,077
IT WAS OBVIOUSLY ZOE.

249
00:10:19,161 --> 00:10:20,871
STILL, NONE OF THIS WOULD
HAVE HAPPENED, IF YOU HADN'T
MEDDLED.

250
00:10:20,954 --> 00:10:22,206
YOU'RE MAD AT THE WRONG PERSON!
I WAS TRYING TO FIX THINGS.

251
00:10:22,289 --> 00:10:23,498
WITH VIGILANTE JUSTICE?

252
00:10:23,582 --> 00:10:25,501
IT'S JUST CALLED JUSTICE,
FRANKS.

253
00:10:25,584 --> 00:10:27,669
THE WORLD'S UNFAIR, SOMETIMES.

254
00:10:27,753 --> 00:10:28,670
THAT'S WHY THERE'S SUPERHEROES.

255
00:10:28,754 --> 00:10:30,631
NO! YOU ARE NOT A SUPERHERO.

256
00:10:30,714 --> 00:10:32,633
YOU'RE A DUMB BOY
WHO DID A DUMB THING,

257
00:10:32,716 --> 00:10:35,260
AND NOW MY DAD IS GONNA
HATE ME FOREVER.

258
00:10:35,344 --> 00:10:37,513
I HAVE TO GET THIS DOWN
BEFORE ANYONE SEES IT.

259
00:10:37,596 --> 00:10:38,805
OKAY, WELL,
THEN LET ME HELP YOU-

260
00:10:38,889 --> 00:10:41,391
NO! YOU'VE ALREADY
DONE ENOUGH.

261
00:10:52,402 --> 00:10:56,031
ZIG:
I'M SO GLAD YOU'RE DOING THIS.

262
00:10:56,031 --> 00:10:58,116
I WOULD HAVE BEEN SO LOST.

263
00:10:58,116 --> 00:11:00,744
I ALWAYS CARRY A STAIN KIT.

264
00:11:00,827 --> 00:11:03,789
FOR COMPETITIONS,
MY GIRLS HAVE TO LOOK PERFECT.

265
00:11:03,872 --> 00:11:05,791
THERE, ALL SET.

266
00:11:11,255 --> 00:11:12,673
(SHIRT RUSTLES)

267
00:11:14,716 --> 00:11:15,801
I SHOULD GET BACK
TO MY TEAM.

268
00:11:15,884 --> 00:11:18,929
ZIG:
WAIT. BEFORE YOU GO...

269
00:11:19,012 --> 00:11:20,514
CAN I GET A SELFIE
WITH MY HERO?

270
00:11:20,597 --> 00:11:22,307
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

271
00:11:24,810 --> 00:11:26,186
(PHONE CAMERA CLICKS)

272
00:11:26,270 --> 00:11:28,939
PERFECT.

273
00:11:29,022 --> 00:11:31,483
MAY I HAVE YOUR NUMBER?
I'LL SEND IT TO YOU.

274
00:11:31,567 --> 00:11:34,027
"MAY I?"
SUCH A GENTLEMAN.

275
00:11:34,111 --> 00:11:35,445
I'M SURPRISED THE GUYS
ARE SO NICE HERE.

276
00:11:35,529 --> 00:11:36,864
WHY WOULDN'T WE BE?

277
00:11:36,947 --> 00:11:39,283
BECAUSE ALL YOUR GIRLS
ARE INSANE.

278
00:11:39,366 --> 00:11:40,701
WELL, I WOULDN'T SAY
"ALL" OF THEM.

279
00:11:40,784 --> 00:11:42,035
I MEAN, LOOK AT YOUR
CHEERLEADERS.

280
00:11:42,119 --> 00:11:44,079
SENDING NUDES FOR MONEY?

281
00:11:44,162 --> 00:11:45,581
THAT KIND OF MAKES THEM
PROSTITUTES.

282
00:11:45,664 --> 00:11:46,665
THAT HASN'T BEEN PROVEN, YET.

283
00:11:46,748 --> 00:11:48,250
I GUESS NOT.

284
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:49,543
BUT WE'VE ALL HEARD
ABOUT THEIR CAPTAIN.

285
00:11:49,626 --> 00:11:51,044
WHAT, ZOE?

286
00:11:51,128 --> 00:11:53,130
YEAH, THAT GIRL
FROM THAT TEEN SHOW,

287
00:11:53,213 --> 00:11:54,631
WHO WAS ALL OVER THE NEWS
FOR THOSE DRUNKEN VIDEOS?

288
00:11:54,715 --> 00:11:56,550
HEY, SHE WAS ASSAULTED.

289
00:11:56,633 --> 00:11:58,218
YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT SHE'S BEEN THROUGH.

290
00:11:58,302 --> 00:12:00,137
I'M SORRY, ARE YOU INTO HER
OR SOMETHING?

291
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:04,391
BECAUSE I KIND OF THOUGHT
WE WERE HITTING IT OFF.

292
00:12:04,474 --> 00:12:05,934
ZOE:
I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT!

293
00:12:06,018 --> 00:12:07,853
OH, YOU DIDN'T MAKE THIS?!
TAKE IT DOWN, NOW.

294
00:12:07,936 --> 00:12:09,271
I HAD THIS UNDER CONTROL

295
00:12:09,354 --> 00:12:10,314
UNTIL YOU TRIED TO MAKE ME
YOUR SCAPEGOAT.

296
00:12:10,397 --> 00:12:11,190
BUT I DIDN'T DO THIS.

297
00:12:11,273 --> 00:12:12,900
WE ALL DID IT.

298
00:12:12,983 --> 00:12:14,109
DON'T PLAY
LITTLE MISS INNOCENT,

299
00:12:14,193 --> 00:12:15,986
JUST BECAUSE YOU DON'T WANT
DADDY TO FIND OUT.

300
00:12:16,069 --> 00:12:17,404
FRANKIE:
I WILL TELL EVERYONE
IT WAS YOU.

301
00:12:17,487 --> 00:12:18,655
ZOE:
AND I'LL POINT THEM
TO THAT FACERANGE PAGE

302
00:12:18,739 --> 00:12:19,740
THAT SAYS HOW MAD
YOU WERE AT ME

303
00:12:19,823 --> 00:12:21,283
FOR KICKING YOU OFF
THE TEAM,

304
00:12:21,366 --> 00:12:22,659
AND OUTLINES HOW YOU
ORCHESTRATED THE WHOLE THING

305
00:12:22,743 --> 00:12:24,119
TO MAKE ME LOOK BAD.

306
00:12:24,203 --> 00:12:25,746
THE OTHER GIRLS
WILL SIDE WITH ME.

307
00:12:25,829 --> 00:12:26,747
THE OTHER GIRLS
WHO'VE JUST BEEN HANDED

308
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:29,666
A GET-OUT-OF-JAIL FREE CARD?

309
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:32,252
FRANKIE:
HOW COULD YOU DO THIS TO ME
AFTER WHAT YOU WENT THROUGH
THIS YEAR?

310
00:12:32,336 --> 00:12:34,796
DO YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENS
IF PEOPLE FIND OUT I DID THIS?

311
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,381
ALL THAT STUFF
GETS DRAGGED OUT AGAIN.

312
00:12:36,465 --> 00:12:39,009
IN THE HALLS, THE PRESS...

313
00:12:39,092 --> 00:12:42,095
YOU KNOW WHAT'LL HAPPEN
TO YOU?

314
00:12:42,179 --> 00:12:44,431
NOTHING.

315
00:12:44,515 --> 00:12:47,976
YOUR RICH DADDY WILL BAIL
YOU OUT AND MAKE IT GO AWAY.

316
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:50,270
DON'T ACT LIKE YOU KNOW
MY FAMILY.

317
00:12:50,354 --> 00:12:51,855
THIS ISN'T FAIR!

318
00:12:51,939 --> 00:12:53,982
ZOE:
LIFE ISN'T FAIR, SWEETIE.

319
00:12:54,066 --> 00:12:55,817
NOW, IF YOU'LL JUST MOVE ASIDE,

320
00:12:55,901 --> 00:12:59,655
I HAVE A REGIONAL CHAMPIONSHIP
TO WIN.

321
00:12:59,738 --> 00:13:01,281
(LOW HUM OF CHATTER)

322
00:13:05,994 --> 00:13:08,205
(BABY CRYING,
PAN SIZZLES ON THE STOVE)

323
00:13:10,791 --> 00:13:13,168
CLARE:
CAN YOU COVER FOR MY CUT
AND DYE THIS MORNING, BARB?

324
00:13:13,252 --> 00:13:15,963
HUBBY'S GOT A MEETING, SO I'VE
GOTTA GET THE KIDS TO DAYCARE.

325
00:13:16,046 --> 00:13:20,342
GREAT! THANK YOU.
(PHONE BEEPS OFF)

326
00:13:20,425 --> 00:13:22,594
MISTER,
WHERE ARE YOUR PANTS?!

327
00:13:22,678 --> 00:13:25,180
YOU'VE GOTTA HAVE SOME PANTS
FOR SCHOOL!

328
00:13:25,264 --> 00:13:27,766
CAN YOU FIND HIM SOME PANTS,
MR. SIMPSON?

329
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:30,561
SIMPSON:
NOW, WE'VE BEEN MARRIED
FOR FIVE YEARS, CLARE-BEAR.

330
00:13:30,644 --> 00:13:32,396
CALL ME ARCHIE.
