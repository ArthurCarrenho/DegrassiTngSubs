YOU'RE SURE THIS IS A REAL
PROFESSIONAL HOCKEY TEAM?

166
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:44,071
DALLAS:
OH YEAH. A REAL HOCKEY TEAM.
IN A REAL LEAGUE.

167
00:06:44,154 --> 00:06:45,906
AND THEY'RE PAYING ME REAL
MONEY TO PLAY NEXT YEAR.

BE LONG-DISTANCE.
WE CAN MAKE IT WORK.

YOUR HEART-TO-HEART WITH CLARE
DIDN'T GO SO WELL?

173
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:00,712
ALLI:
I ASKED HER TO HELP WITH PROM,

174
00:07:00,796 --> 00:07:03,507
AND YOU'D THINK I'D INVITED HER
TO HER OWN EXECUTION OR
SOMETHING.

175
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:05,634
I THINK SHE'S MOVED ON.

DALLAS: FROM HIGH SCHOOL?
ALLI: FROM ME.

177
00:07:08,053 --> 00:07:10,097
YOU KNOW SHE DITCHED ME THIS
MORNING TO HANG OUT WITH HER
BOYFRIEND!

178
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:12,099
HER AND ELI SHOULD
JUST GET MARRIED

179
00:07:12,182 --> 00:07:13,559
AND MOVE TO SOME DESERTED
ISLAND

180
00:07:13,642 --> 00:07:16,270

MORE UNDERSTANDING.

ALLI:
ABOUT THE BABY?

183
00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:21,066
CLARE'S NOT THE FIRST GIRL
IN THE WORLD TO BE PREGNANT,
YOU KNOW.

184
00:07:21,149 --> 00:07:22,484
ELI: SHE ISN'T.
ALLI: WHAT?!

185
00:07:25,612 --> 00:07:29,283
ELI:
WE LOST THE BABY.

186
00:07:29,366 --> 00:07:32,244
DALLAS:
WHOA, DUDE.
I'M SO SORRY.

187
00:07:32,327 --> 00:07:35,789

I CAN'T BELIEVE
SHE DIDN'T TELL YOU.

188
00:07:35,873 --> 00:07:37,249

LET ME TAKE THOSE.

WANT ME INVOLVED?

THAT'S INCREDIBLE.

00:12:21,783 --> 00:12:24,036
YEAH. EXCEPT HE DOESN'T WANT
TO GO OUT WITH THE REAL ME,

296
00:12:24,119 --> 00:12:25,746
HE WANTS TO GO OUT
WITH FICTIONAL ME.

297
00:12:25,829 --> 00:12:27,414
IT'S ALREADY DOOMED.

298
00:12:27,497 --> 00:12:29,291
WHICH SUCKS BECAUSE
HE'S A SWEETHEART,

299
00:12:29,374 --> 00:12:30,709
AND I THINK I COULD
REALLY LIKE HIM.

300

ZOE:
OKAY, WELL...

301
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:38,509
WHY NOT GO OUT WITH HIM AGAIN,
BUT THIS TIME BE YOURSELF?

302
00:12:38,592 --> 00:12:40,093
SO HE CAN DUMP ME FASTER THAN HE
CAN MOUNTAIN BIKE DOWN A HILL?

303
00:12:40,177 --> 00:12:41,887
YOU SHOULD AT LEAST TRY.

304
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:43,430
HE OBVIOUSLY LIKES PARTS OF YOU.

305
00:12:43,514 --> 00:12:44,640
SO HE MIGHT LIKE THE REAL YOU.

306
00:12:44,723 --> 00:12:46,808
BUT WHAT IF HE DOESN'T?

307
00:12:46,892 --> 00:12:49,102
THEN I'VE THROWN AWAY MY ONE
SHOT AT ROMANCE SINCE MILES.

308
00:12:49,186 --> 00:12:50,729
IS THAT REALLY
WHAT YOU WANT?

309
00:12:50,812 --> 00:12:52,731
LOOK AT YOU.

310
00:12:52,814 --> 00:12:56,276
YOU'RE IN CLASS,
LITERALLY DRESSING YOUR WOUNDS.

311
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:58,654
WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY,

YOU DO?

320
00:13:22,678 --> 00:13:26,682
MS. PILL:
I'M A SUCKER
FOR A BEAUTIFUL PROM.

321
00:13:26,765 --> 00:13:28,433
AND YOUR PRESENTATION
WAS VERY IMPRESSIVE.

322
00:13:28,517 --> 00:13:30,310
DID YOU HAVE HELP?

323
00:13:30,394 --> 00:13:32,688
I WAS SUPPOSED TO.

324
00:13:32,771 --> 00:13:35,190
HMM. YOUR CO-CHAIR
WAS CLARE EDWARDS?

325
00:13:35,274 --> 00:13:37,276
SHE'S BEEN THROUGH
A LOT THIS YEAR.
