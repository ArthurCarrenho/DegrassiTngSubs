334
00:14:13,562 --> 00:14:16,023
ELI TOLD ME
HE'D ALWAYS BE THERE FOR ME.

335
00:14:16,106 --> 00:14:18,275
AND THAT'S A PROBLEM WHY?

336
00:14:18,358 --> 00:14:21,236
BECAUSE WHEN HE SAID THAT
I WANTED TO KISS HIM.

337
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:23,655
NOW I DON'T WANT TO SAY
I TOLD YOU SO...

338
00:14:23,739 --> 00:14:25,532
NO, ALLI, THIS IS REALLY BAD.
WE CAN'T GET BACK TOGETHER.

339
00:14:25,616 --> 00:14:27,492
WHY NOT?

340
00:14:27,576 --> 00:14:28,702

BE US IN THE PICTURE ANYMORE!

ALL THAT MUCH.

345
00:14:34,333 --> 00:14:35,792

SOME BOUNDARIES,

INTO OLD HABITS.

347

TELL HIM NOT TO DO ANYTHING

348
00:14:39,171 --> 00:14:40,088

KISS HIM?

349
