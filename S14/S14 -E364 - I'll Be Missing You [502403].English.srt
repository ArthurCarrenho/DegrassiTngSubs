OKAY, JUST PLEASE DON'T,
YOU'RE MAKING IT WORSE.

172
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:47,950
YOU SOUND JUST LIKE WINSTON.

173
00:06:48,033 --> 00:06:49,409
HE THINKS I'M THE PROBLEM.

174
00:06:49,493 --> 00:06:52,621
WHAT?!
WHAT PROBLEM?

175
00:06:52,704 --> 00:06:55,207
HE JUST SEEMS TO THINK
THAT BEING WITH ME

176
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:57,292
HAS CAUSED ALL THESE
CHANGES IN YOU.

177
00:06:57,376 --> 00:06:59,002
YOU'RE TALKING TO WINSTON
ABOUT ME?!

178
00:06:59,086 --> 00:07:00,462
TRISTAN:
LOOK, PEOPLE ARE NOTICING
THINGS.

179
00:07:00,546 --> 00:07:01,713
YOU'RE MOODY, IRRITABLE,

180
00:07:01,797 --> 00:07:02,798
AND YOU SKIP CLASS
ALL THE TIME.

181
00:07:02,881 --> 00:07:06,844
WHAT IS IT WITH YOU PEOPLE?!

182
00:07:06,927 --> 00:07:09,763
JUST...
JUST TELL ME IF IT'S ME.

LOOK. (SIGHS)

184
00:07:14,059 --> 00:07:15,978
TRISTAN, YOU CAN'T BE
THE PROBLEM,

185
00:07:16,061 --> 00:07:18,438
BECAUSE THERE IS NO PROBLEM.

186
00:07:18,522 --> 00:07:20,566
ARE YOU SURE?

187
00:07:20,649 --> 00:07:23,110
YES. ALL OUR FRIENDS ARE,
THEY'RE JUST JEALOUS
THAT WE'RE HAPPY,

188
00:07:23,193 --> 00:07:25,821
AND THEY'RE NOT.

189
00:07:25,904 --> 00:07:29,324
OKAY, WELL, YOU KNOW
HOW WE CAN PROVE THEM WRONG?

190
00:07:29,408 --> 00:07:32,828
BY ACING THIS HISTORY PROJECT...

I LOVE BEING A CHEERLEADER,
BUT I CAN'T LET ELLEN DOWN,

198
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:57,603

I'VE JUST... NEVER HAD
A SURPRISE PARTY BEFORE.

213
00:08:49,321 --> 00:08:52,491
I'VE NEVER HAD FRIENDS TO THROW
ME A SURPRISE PARTY BEFORE.

214
00:08:52,574 --> 00:08:55,077
AW, COME, GUYS!

215
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:58,664
HMM!

216
00:08:58,747 --> 00:09:01,834
OKAY, SO, WHAT'D YOU CALL
THIS MEETING ABOUT?

217
00:09:01,917 --> 00:09:05,128

AT KEEPING SECRETS.

DALLAS, LOOK, I'M SORRY I DIDN'T
TELL YOU ABOUT CAMBRIDGE.

222
00:09:23,355 --> 00:09:25,732
NO, NOT THAT.

223
00:09:25,816 --> 00:09:28,026
CAMBRIDGE IS AN AMAZING
OPPORTUNITY WHICH I SUPPORT.

224
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:29,987
THEN WHAT SECRET
AM I KEEPING?

225
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:31,363
WHERE YOU'RE GONNA BE
TOMORROW NIGHT,

226
00:09:31,446 --> 00:09:33,031
WHEN YOU TELL YOUR PARENTS
YOU'RE STAYING AT CLARE'S.

227
00:09:33,115 --> 00:09:34,867
AND WHERE WILL THAT BE,
EXACTLY?

228
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:37,160
OKAY,
LET ME SET THE SCENE.

229
00:09:37,244 --> 00:09:38,537
A ROMANTIC DINNER
IN A QUIET RESTAURANT...

230
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:40,873
I LIKE, I LIKE!

231
00:09:40,956 --> 00:09:42,499
WHERE WE CLINK GLASSES,
AND FEAST ON OYSTERS,

232
00:09:42,583 --> 00:09:43,584
AND CHOCOLATE COVERED
STRAWBERRIES.

233
00:09:43,667 --> 00:09:45,794
I LOVE, I LOVE!

234
00:09:45,878 --> 00:09:48,797
BUT, ONE, DO YOU EVEN
LIKE OYSTERS?

235
00:09:48,881 --> 00:09:50,966
AND TWO, WHY DO I HAVE
TO LIE TO MY PARENTS?

236
00:09:51,049 --> 00:09:54,303
BECAUSE AFTERWARDS WE'RE
SPENDING THE NIGHT IN A HOTEL.

NO.

240
00:09:59,725 --> 00:10:01,894
WHY NOT?
IT'LL BE SO ROMANTIC!

241
00:10:01,977 --> 00:10:04,021
EXACTLY, TOO ROMANTIC,

242
00:10:04,104 --> 00:10:05,814
AND I'M WORRIED THAT
WE'LL BE TEMPTED

243
00:10:05,898 --> 00:10:07,232
TO SPEND LESS TIME TALKING,
AND MORE TIME-

245
00:10:08,984 --> 00:10:11,570
YES, AND I'M NOT
READY FOR THAT.

WITH ME?

247
00:10:14,031 --> 00:10:17,993
BECAUSE YOU'VE DONE IT
WITH OTHER GUYS.

ABOUT OUR FUTURES.

DOES IT EVER HURT TO BE
SO WRONG ALL THE TIME?

253
00:10:37,429 --> 00:10:39,473
WHAT NOW?

254
00:10:39,556 --> 00:10:42,601
WELL, MILES AND I TALKED,
AND I'M NOT THE PROBLEM!

255
00:10:42,684 --> 00:10:44,603

FOR A FASHION PRESENTATION?

261
00:10:58,534 --> 00:11:00,619
CLOCK'S TICKING, TRISTAN.

262
00:11:00,702 --> 00:11:01,870
UM, CAN'T WE LET IT TICK
FOR JUST A FEW MORE SECONDS?

263
00:11:01,954 --> 00:11:03,705
HE'LL BE HERE.

264
00:11:03,789 --> 00:11:06,917
SEEMS LIKE YOU HAVE
A PROBLEM NOW.

265
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,169
FINE, UM, HOW ABOUT
I GET STARTED,

266
00:11:09,253 --> 00:11:10,712
AND HE'LL JUMP IN
WHEN HE ARRIVES?

267
00:11:10,796 --> 00:11:12,172
ALL RIGHT.

268
00:11:19,471 --> 00:11:22,224
AHEM!
UH, FASHIONS OF WORLD WAR II:

ESTABLISH STATUS,

273
00:11:37,322 --> 00:11:40,325
WHICH MILES IS ON HIS WAY
HERE WITH...

274
00:11:40,409 --> 00:11:44,079
AND IMAGINE THERE'S
SILVER CAPTAIN WINGS

275
00:11:44,162 --> 00:11:46,582
PINNED RIGHT HERE,
AND UM, IF MILES WAS HERE,

276
00:11:46,665 --> 00:11:49,501
I'D SAY, "PRIVATE MILES."
AND SEEING MY CAPTAIN'S WINGS,

277
00:11:51,712 --> 00:11:54,923
HE'D SAY,
"YES, SIR, CAPTAIN!"

278
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:56,258
UM... UH...

279
00:11:59,261 --> 00:12:02,139
SORRY, UH...
"PRIVATE, I NEED-"

280
00:12:02,222 --> 00:12:04,099
OKAY, LET ME STOP YOU THERE.

281
00:12:04,183 --> 00:12:06,393
I'M SORRY, I'M TRYING MY BEST.

282
00:12:06,476 --> 00:12:07,102
MR. PERINO:
YOUR PRESENTATION
WASN'T THE PROBLEM.

283
00:12:07,186 --> 00:12:09,438
YOUR CHOICE OF PARTNER WAS.

284
00:12:09,521 --> 00:12:11,523
MAYBE NEXT TIME, CHOOSE SOMEONE
A LITTLE MORE RELIABLE.

285
00:12:11,607 --> 00:12:14,151
OKAY, WHO'S NEXT?

286
00:12:14,234 --> 00:12:15,944
AND NOW I CAN'T EVEN GET
MY MONEY BACK,

287
00:12:16,028 --> 00:12:17,362
'CAUSE I GOT THE HOTEL ROOM
AT A DISCOUNT PRICE.

DREW:
WAIT, SO HOW MUCH YOU OUT?

289
00:12:18,906 --> 00:12:20,324
NINETY-FIVE DOLLARS,
AND A GIRLFRIEND!

290
00:12:20,407 --> 00:12:22,075
NO DUDE, IT'S NOT LIKE
SHE BROKE UP WITH YOU.

291
00:12:22,159 --> 00:12:23,243
SHE PRACTICALLY SAID SHE
DOESN'T WANNA HAVE SEX WITH ME,

292
00:12:23,327 --> 00:12:24,953
THAT'S WORSE!

293
00:12:25,037 --> 00:12:26,413
YOU WAITED, LIKE,
A YEAR TO DATE ALLI,

294
00:12:26,496 --> 00:12:28,081
I'M PRETTY SURE YOU CAN WAIT
A LITTLE BIT LONGER

295
00:12:28,165 --> 00:12:29,291
TO GIVE HER THE BUSINESS!

296

(GROANS)

297
00:12:31,126 --> 00:12:33,253
IF IT'S GONNA HAPPEN, FINE.

298
00:12:33,337 --> 00:12:34,671
BUT SHE DOESN'T THINK
I'M WORTH IT.

299
00:12:34,755 --> 00:12:36,340
AND SOON SHE'S GONNA BE
IN ENGLAND,

300
00:12:36,423 --> 00:12:38,425
WITH ALL THOSE SMART GUYS
WHO ARE GONNA BE LIKE,

301
00:12:38,509 --> 00:12:40,219
(WITH ENGLISH ACCENT)
LET'S TALK ABOUT SCIENCE,
AND HAVE A SPOT OF TEA!

302
00:12:40,302 --> 00:12:41,929
OR SHE'LL BE AT MIT
WITH THOSE GUYS,

303
00:12:42,012 --> 00:12:44,181
WHO ARE GONNA BE LIKE,
YEAH, LET'S HAVE AN APPLE,

304
00:12:44,264 --> 00:12:46,934
AND TALK ABOUT ASTROPHYSICS,
AND STUFF.

305
00:12:47,017 --> 00:12:48,685
WHATEVER,
I'M BAD AT ACCENTS!

306
00:12:48,769 --> 00:12:50,312
THE POINT IS, IT'S ONLY
A MATTER OF TIME

307
00:12:50,395 --> 00:12:52,481
BEFORE I'M THE MAYOR
OF DUMPSBURG!

308
00:12:52,564 --> 00:12:53,982
DUDE, RELAX, ALL RIGHT?

309
00:12:54,066 --> 00:12:54,858
SHE'S NOT GONNA BREAK UP
WITH YOU,

310
00:12:54,942 --> 00:12:56,193
YOU GUYS ARE A PERFECT MATCH.

311
00:12:56,276 --> 00:12:57,819
TELL HER THAT.

312
00:12:57,903 --> 00:12:59,655
OH CRAP, MAN, I GOTTA GO.

313
00:12:59,738 --> 00:13:00,239
KEEP STRONG,

(SIGHS)

316
00:13:10,666 --> 00:13:13,001
SHAY:
YOU SHOULDN'T DO THAT
ON YOUR OWN.

317
00:13:13,085 --> 00:13:15,546
DALLAS:
WHAT DO YOU KNOW, NINER?

318
00:13:15,629 --> 00:13:17,381
SHAY:
I KNOW THIS IS ABOUT TEN POUNDS
MORE THAN YOUR USUAL MAX.

319
00:13:17,464 --> 00:13:20,509
AND IT'S YOUR LAST SET.

320
00:13:20,592 --> 00:13:22,886
I ALSO KNOW IT DOESN'T
MATTER WHAT FANCY SCHOOL
YOUR GIRL GOES TO.

321
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:26,723
SHE'LL PROBABLY DUMP YOU,
REGARDLESS.

322
00:13:26,807 --> 00:13:28,684
YEAH, ALL THANKS
TO YOUR GREAT ADVICE!

323
00:13:28,767 --> 00:13:30,185
YOU KNOW WHAT,
NEXT TIME,

324
00:13:30,269 --> 00:13:32,980
WHY DON'T YOU MIND
YOUR OWN DAMN BUSINESS!

325
00:13:33,063 --> 00:13:35,858
I'M SORRY,
I'M JUST TRYING TO HELP.

326
00:13:35,941 --> 00:13:38,193
I OVERREACTED.

327
00:13:38,277 --> 00:13:39,736
I JUST DON'T WANT
TO LOSE ALLI.

328
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:43,073
WHATEVER, I GET IT.

329
00:13:43,156 --> 00:13:46,243
HEY, YOU KNOW,
ACTUALLY, I DON'T!

330
00:13:46,326 --> 00:13:48,203
WHY WOULD YOU WANNA BE
WITH SOMEONE
WHO MAKES YOU MISERABLE?!

331
00:13:48,287 --> 00:13:50,080
DALLAS: SHE DOESN'T.
SHAY: SHE DOES!

332
00:13:50,163 --> 00:13:52,332
EVEN THOUGH YOU'RE THE BEST
ATHLETE IN THIS JOINT.

333
00:13:52,416 --> 00:13:54,418
ME?

334
00:13:54,501 --> 00:13:57,504
YOU PLAYED JUNIOR A HOCKEY,
CAPTAIN OF THE BASKETBALL TEAM,

335
00:13:57,588 --> 00:13:59,381
PLUS, YOU'RE FUNNY.

336
00:13:59,464 --> 00:14:00,883
I TELL A FEW JOKES.

337
00:14:00,966 --> 00:14:03,468
THOSE ACCENTS EARLIER?
I DIED!
