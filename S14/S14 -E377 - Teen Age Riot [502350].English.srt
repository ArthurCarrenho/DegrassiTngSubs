YEAH. WELL, WHERE ELSE
ARE WE SUPPOSED TO GO?

7
00:00:19,937 --> 00:00:21,146
WE CAN'T DO IT AT MAYA'S HOUSE,

8
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:23,065
WE CAN'T DO IT AT SCHOOL,
OBVIOUSLY!

00:00:23,148 --> 00:00:24,942

00:00:28,987 --> 00:00:30,906
TAKE ITS MATE TO ITS NEST.

13
00:00:30,989 --> 00:00:32,991
WOULD YOU PLEASE STOP
WATCHING ANIMAL PLANET?!

14
00:00:33,075 --> 00:00:34,451
THAT'S ACTUALLY A GREAT IDEA.

15
00:00:34,535 --> 00:00:36,578
WHY DON'T I COME OVER TONIGHT?

16
00:00:36,662 --> 00:00:38,455
OH, NO, YOU DON'T WANT

BUT, WHAT IF SHE FINDS LIKE,
VINCE'S DRUGS, OR SOMETHING?

THAT KIND OF THING IS A DEAL
BREAKER FOR GIRLS LIKE MAYA.

27
00:01:02,187 --> 00:01:04,773
AND SO, THE ZIG WORRIES,

28
00:01:04,857 --> 00:01:07,276
WILL A VISIT TO ITS NEST
PROVIDE A VENUE FOR MATING,
