00:07:31,493 --> 00:07:34,997
AFTER HE... YOU-KNOW-WHAT
WITH YOU-KNOW-WHO?

166
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,832
OOH, ARE WE GOSSIPING?
WHO DID WHAT WITH WHO?

167
00:07:36,915 --> 00:07:38,375
GIVE ME ALL THE DIRT!

168
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:40,878
YOU KISSED HER BOYFRIEND?
REMEMBER?

169
00:07:40,961 --> 00:07:44,131
OH. THAT. BUT I'VE APOLOGIZED
A GAGILLION TIMES!

170
00:07:44,214 --> 00:07:45,174
YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO'S ALWAYS SAYING

171
00:07:45,257 --> 00:07:47,050
YOU DON'T WANNA END UP

SO YOU REALLY DON'T THINK
THERE'S ANY WAY FOR ME

174
00:07:50,387 --> 00:07:51,972
TO TRUST WINSTON AGAIN?

175
00:07:52,055 --> 00:07:55,559
ONLY IF YOU CAN PROVE
THAT HE WILL NEVER, EVER

176
00:07:55,642 --> 00:07:56,935

194
00:08:49,988 --> 00:08:51,406
AND HIS BROTHER, VINCENT,
IS THAT RIGHT?

195
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:53,742
YEAH. HOW-
HOW DO YOU KNOW ALL THIS?

196
00:08:53,825 --> 00:08:57,788
WELL, WE'VE BEEN KEEPING AN EYE
ON YOU FOR A WHILE NOW, ZIG.

197
00:08:57,871 --> 00:09:00,457
TINY WAS STABBED
A FEW WEEKS AGO, RIGHT?

198
00:09:00,541 --> 00:09:02,376
THAT MUST HAVE BEEN ROUGH.

199
00:09:02,459 --> 00:09:04,711
UH, YEAH.
YEAH, IT WAS.

200
00:09:04,795 --> 00:09:06,463
I'M SURE YOU HEARD BY NOW
THAT DAMON CARTER

201
00:09:06,547 --> 00:09:08,382
WAS SHOT LAST NIGHT.

202
00:09:08,465 --> 00:09:10,717
YOU TWO USED TO BE
FRIENDS, RIGHT?

203
00:09:10,801 --> 00:09:12,386
UH, KIND OF. YEAH.

204
00:09:12,469 --> 00:09:14,596
SO WHAT HAPPENED?

205
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:18,642
I DON'T KNOW. I GUESS WE JUST...
DRIFTED APART.

206
00:09:18,725 --> 00:09:21,687
OR YOU GOT CAUGHT ON OPPOSITE
SIDES OF A TURF WAR?

207
00:09:24,439 --> 00:09:25,649
WERE YOU INVOLVED IN THIS,
ZIG?

NOT ONLY ARE YOU AN ACCESSORY
TO AN ATTEMPTED MURDER,

211
00:09:32,072 --> 00:09:34,116
BUT YOU'RE LOOKING AT AN
OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE CHARGE.

00:09:34,199 --> 00:09:37,494
YOU COULD GO TO JAIL.

213

YOU EITHER DO THE RIGHT THING
AND HELP ME OUT,

214
00:09:39,288 --> 00:09:41,582
OR YOU CONTINUE PROTECTING
WHOEVER YOU'RE PROTECTING,

215
00:09:41,665 --> 00:09:44,001
AND... I WON'T BE ABLE TO DO
ANYTHING FOR YOU.

216
00:09:46,378 --> 00:09:48,005
LET ME ASK YOU,

217

SADLY, IT'S JUST
A NEON T-SHIRT,

223
00:10:07,858 --> 00:10:09,818
AND VOLUNTEERING
WOULD BE GREAT

224
00:10:09,902 --> 00:10:11,862
IF IT WASN'T FOR DREW.

225
00:10:11,945 --> 00:10:13,363
HE KEPT BUGGING ME
ABOUT OUR RELATIONSHIP.

226
00:10:13,447 --> 00:10:15,616
JUST IGNORE HIM.
HE'S JUST JEALOUS.

227
00:10:15,699 --> 00:10:18,744
WELL, HE KEPT SAYING HE DOESN'T
THINK YOU'RE TRUSTWORTHY.

228
00:10:18,827 --> 00:10:20,579
DO YOU BELIEVE HIM?

229
00:10:20,662 --> 00:10:22,289
NO, OF COURSE NOT.

230
00:10:22,372 --> 00:10:23,665

WHAT HE SAYS?

BECKY: MY MONEY'S GONE!

236
00:10:40,849 --> 00:10:43,185
I HAD TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS
IN HERE FOR YEARBOOK
AND PROM TICKETS.

237
00:10:43,268 --> 00:10:44,353
MAYBE UH...
MAYBE YOU LEFT IT AT HOME?

238
00:10:44,436 --> 00:10:46,688
NO, NO, NO.
IT WAS DEFINITELY IN HERE.

239
00:10:46,772 --> 00:10:48,565

STOLEN IT!

240

WE HAD COFFEE AT THE DOT

242
00:10:52,069 --> 00:10:53,362
BEFORE YOUR SHIFT, RIGHT?

243
00:10:53,445 --> 00:10:57,407
YEAH, AND THEN I HAD IT
WITH ME ALL DAY...

244
00:10:57,491 --> 00:10:58,784
EXCEPT WHEN I FORGOT IT
IN A PATIENT'S ROOM

245
00:10:58,867 --> 00:11:01,203
AND HAD TO GO BACK
TO GET IT!

246
00:11:01,286 --> 00:11:02,788

STOLE FROM YOU?

ALL BLOW OVER.
