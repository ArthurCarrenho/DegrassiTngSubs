00:00:01,502 --> 00:00:04,213
FRANKIE:
OH MY GATSBY!
THIS IS INSANE!

2
00:00:04,296 --> 00:00:05,214
MRS. HOLLINGSWORTH:
THIS IS WHAT YOU WANTED, RIGHT?

3
00:00:05,297 --> 00:00:06,798
FRANKIE:
ARE YOU KIDDING?
IT'S PERFECT!

4
00:00:07,257 --> 00:00:09,218
THE FEATHERS,
THE PEARLS...

5
00:00:09,301 --> 00:00:10,969
IS THIS A GRAMOPHONE?!

6
00:00:11,053 --> 00:00:12,346
MRS. HOLLINGSWORTH: MM-HMM!
FRANKIE: THIS IS SO COOL!

7
00:00:12,429 --> 00:00:13,514
HUNTER:
A PERFECT MONUMENT

8
00:00:13,597 --> 00:00:16,350
TO THE DECLINE
OF AMERICAN CIVILISATION.

9
00:00:16,433 --> 00:00:18,560
WHAT? THAT'S WHAT GREAT
GATSBY'S REALLY ABOUT, RIGHT?

10
00:00:18,644 --> 00:00:19,186
MRS. HOLLINGSWORTH:
NO NEED FOR SOUR GRAPES,
HUNTER.

11
00:00:19,269 --> 00:00:21,230
I ASKED WHAT YOU WANTED, TOO.

12
00:00:21,313 --> 00:00:22,814
HUNTER:
AND I TOLD YOU:
AN OUT.

13
00:00:22,898 --> 00:00:25,692
I'M NOT REALLY "PARTY PEOPLE."

14
00:00:25,776 --> 00:00:27,361
MRS. HOLLINGSWORTH:
OUR FAMILY'S BEEN THROUGH
A LOT LATELY.

15
00:00:27,444 --> 00:00:31,198
WE NEED TO STICK TOGETHER
ON SPECIAL DAYS LIKE THIS.

16
00:00:31,281 --> 00:00:36,036
FRANKIE:
YOU KNOW WHAT WOULD MAKE THIS
PARTY REALLY SPECIAL?

17
00:00:36,119 --> 00:00:37,412
FRANKIE: A CHAMPAGNE FOUNTAIN.
MRS. HOLLINGSWORTH: MM.

18
00:00:37,496 --> 00:00:38,997
IT'S ART DECO,
AND IT'S SO ON THEME!

19
00:00:39,081 --> 00:00:40,624
FRANKIE, YOU'RE FIFTEEN.

20
00:00:40,707 --> 00:00:42,918
AND ALCOHOL WAS ILLEGAL
IN THE TWENTIES.

21
00:00:43,001 --> 00:00:45,003
MRS. HOLLINGSWORTH:
AND TO DEFLECT ANY REBUTTAL,
YOUR PARTY DRESS IS HERE.

22
00:00:45,087 --> 00:00:47,339
IT'S VINTAGE.

23
00:00:47,422 --> 00:00:50,467
(GASPS) THIS IS SO
FREAKING AMAZING!

24
00:00:50,551 --> 00:00:52,219
FIFTEEN AND ALREADY A FLAPPER?

25
00:00:52,302 --> 00:00:54,888
HUNTER:
DAD!

26
00:00:54,972 --> 00:00:55,931
I THOUGHT WE KICKED YOU OUT.

27
00:00:56,014 --> 00:00:58,100
HONEY, HE'S STILL YOUR FATHER.

28
00:00:58,183 --> 00:01:00,394
MR. HOLLINGSWORTH:
PLUS, I COME BEARING
BIRTHDAY GIFTS.

29
00:01:00,477 --> 00:01:03,063
MR. HOLLINGSWORTH: HUNTER.
HUNTER: THANKS.

30
00:01:03,146 --> 00:01:06,400
OH MAN, THIS MUST HAVE
COST TWO GRAND!

31
00:01:06,483 --> 00:01:09,486
MR. HOLLINGSWORTH:
AND FOR MY DARLING DAUGHTER.

32
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:10,737
FRANKIE:
DO YOU THINK BUYING
EXPENSIVE GIFTS

33
00:01:10,821 --> 00:01:12,447
WILL MAKE EVERYTHING BETTER?

34
00:01:12,531 --> 00:01:14,783
MRS. H: HONEY.
MR. H: NO, SHE'S RIGHT.

35
00:01:14,867 --> 00:01:17,411
ONLY TIME WILL TELL.

36
00:01:17,494 --> 00:01:20,330
HOW ABOUT I DRIVE YOU
TO SCHOOL?

37
00:01:20,414 --> 00:01:22,875
I'D RATHER WALK.

38
00:01:22,958 --> 00:01:24,918
♪ Whatever it takes! ♪

39
00:01:25,002 --> 00:01:27,087
♪ The best that I can be ♪

40
00:01:27,171 --> 00:01:28,463
♪ Oh, oh, oh... ♪

41
00:01:28,547 --> 00:01:31,383

42
00:01:33,719 --> 00:01:37,389
(BEEPING)
MAYA: THERE WE GO.

43
00:01:37,472 --> 00:01:41,977
PASSWORD IS SET.
TRY GETTING IN NOW, THIEVES!

44
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:44,771
THIEVES DIDN'T
BREAK IN HERE.

45
00:01:44,855 --> 00:01:45,981
(FRIDGE DOOR THUMPS SHUT)

46
00:01:46,064 --> 00:01:48,442
THIS WAS TIED TO THE LAMP.

47
00:01:48,525 --> 00:01:51,236
THE BREAK-IN WAS A MESSAGE
FROM DAMON.

48
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:55,115
WHY WOULD HE DO THAT?

49
00:01:55,199 --> 00:01:58,410
AFTER HE STABBED TINY,

50
00:01:58,493 --> 00:02:00,454
I WARNED HIM THAT
SOMETHING CRAZY MIGHT HAPPEN;

51
00:02:00,537 --> 00:02:03,749
SOME KIND OF RETALIATION.
WE SHOULD TELL THE COPS.

52
00:02:03,832 --> 00:02:04,416
MAYA:
NO! MY MOM WILL KICK YOU OUT
IF SHE THINKS YOU HAD

53
00:02:04,499 --> 00:02:07,836
SOMETHING TO DO WITH THIS.

54
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:08,962
MRS. MATLIN:
YOU FIGURE OUT THE NEW SYSTEM?

55
00:02:09,046 --> 00:02:10,631
GOOD.

56
00:02:10,714 --> 00:02:12,591
THIS BREAK-IN
MUST MAKE IT TOUGH TO COPE.

57
00:02:12,674 --> 00:02:15,052
WHICH IS WHY I BOOKED YOU
AND A PLUS ONE

58
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:16,345
INTO THE SPA TODAY,
AFTER SCHOOL.

59
00:02:16,428 --> 00:02:17,304
YOU DESERVE SOME FUN
WITH FRIENDS.

60
00:02:17,387 --> 00:02:18,430
THAT'S NOT NECESSARY,
MOM.

61
00:02:18,514 --> 00:02:19,723
I INSIST.
TAKE ZOE.

62
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:21,517
SHE HAS DETENTION.

63
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,227
THEN ASK ONE OF YOUR
OTHER GIRLFRIENDS!

64
00:02:27,064 --> 00:02:28,232
YEAH, YOU SHOULD
TOTALLY DO THAT.

65
00:02:28,315 --> 00:02:29,149
YEAH, EXCEPT FOR YOU
AND I BOTH KNOW

66
00:02:29,233 --> 00:02:31,818
I HAVE NO GIRLFRIENDS.

67
00:02:31,902 --> 00:02:33,237
IF MY MOM KNOWS THAT,

68
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:36,323
SHE'LL THINK THERE'S SOMETHING
WRONG WITH ME.

69
00:02:36,406 --> 00:02:37,324
WHAT ABOUT GRACE?
SHE'S A GIRL, RIGHT?

70
00:02:37,407 --> 00:02:39,034
HAVE YOU MET HER?

71
00:02:39,117 --> 00:02:40,827
MAYA:
COME ON, WHO DOESN'T LOVE
A FREE MANI-PEDI?

72
00:02:40,911 --> 00:02:43,455
(STUDENTS CHATTER)

73
00:02:43,539 --> 00:02:44,831
IMOGEN:
THIS IS THE PITS!

74
00:02:44,915 --> 00:02:46,333
BETWEEN MUSICAL REHEARSALS
AND YOUR DETENTION,

75
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:47,835
I BARELY SEE YOU.

76
00:02:47,918 --> 00:02:49,086
JACK:
AWWWWW... MUFFIN.

77
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:51,171
YOU'RE SO CUTE
WHEN YOU MISS ME.

78
00:02:51,255 --> 00:02:52,965
DREW:
CAST YOUR NOMINATIONS
FOR YEARBOOK'S BEST HAIR, STYLE,

79
00:02:53,048 --> 00:02:55,008

00:02:55,092 --> 00:02:56,301

I'D SAY YOU TWO HAVE A CHANCE
AT THAT LAST ONE.

WOULDN'T IT BE AWESOME?!

82
00:02:57,970 --> 00:02:59,012

I'LL NOMINATE YOU RIGHT NOW
IF YOU KISS FOR ME.

86
00:03:04,518 --> 00:03:07,104
YEAH, EASY THERE,
KNUCKLE DRAGGER, OKAY?

87
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:09,022
THERE'S A BAN ON PDA
IN THESE HERE HALLS.

88
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:10,190
BUT MORE TO THE POINT,

89
00:03:10,274 --> 00:03:12,818
WE WILL NOT LIP WRESTLE
FOR YOUR ENJOYMENT!

90
00:03:12,901 --> 00:03:13,610
THEN WHAT'S THE POINT
OF BEING LESBIANS?

91
00:03:13,694 --> 00:03:15,404
OH, YOU PIG!

92
00:03:15,487 --> 00:03:17,781
NO, I JUST LOVE DIVERSITY!

93
00:03:17,865 --> 00:03:19,241
YOU SHOULD BE MORE DIVERSE
RIGHT NOW!

94
00:03:19,324 --> 00:03:20,951
IMOGEN: SHUT UP!
JACK: IMOGEN...

95
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:22,661
DAMON:
YEAH, CHILL OUT,
TAKE A BREATH.

96
00:03:22,744 --> 00:03:25,455
THAT'S IT.
UNGH!

97
00:03:25,539 --> 00:03:27,332
DAMON:
FEISTY! I LIKE IT.
DO IT AGAIN.

98
00:03:27,416 --> 00:03:29,126
WELL, IF YOU INSIST.

99
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:32,129
DAMON: UNGH!

HAPPY BIRTHDAY!

IT'S A VANILLA CAKE-SHAKE!

105
00:03:48,353 --> 00:03:50,522
THANKS, GUYS.
(BLOWS OUT CANDLE)

106
00:03:53,358 --> 00:03:54,359
I TOLD YOU WE SHOULD'VE
GOTTEN CHOCOLATE!

107
00:03:54,443 --> 00:03:56,278
SORRY.

108
00:03:56,361 --> 00:03:58,155
I'M MAD ABOUT THE FATHER,
NOT THE FLAVOUR.

109
00:03:58,238 --> 00:04:00,616
SHAY:
YIKES. YOU SAW YOUR DAD?

110
00:04:00,699 --> 00:04:02,117
LOLA:
I THOUGHT HE MOVED OUT.

111
00:04:02,201 --> 00:04:04,286
AND NOW HE'S DROPPING IN
FOR BIRTHDAY-RUINING VISITS!

112
00:04:04,369 --> 00:04:05,996
DID HE BRING PRESENTS
AT LEAST?

113
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:09,374
I DON'T WANT STUFF.
I WANT FRIENDS AND FUN.

114
00:04:09,458 --> 00:04:11,293
MY PARENTS ARE SUPPOSED
TO BE SEPARATED.

115
00:04:11,376 --> 00:04:12,794
WHY CAN'T HE JUST
LEAVE ME ALONE?

116
00:04:12,878 --> 00:04:13,962
BECAUSE HE'S YOUR DAD?

117
00:04:14,046 --> 00:04:15,964
NO.
HE'S AN ABUSIVE MONSTER

118
00:04:16,048 --> 00:04:17,466
WHO WANTED ME TO TAKE THE BLAME
FOR DEGRASSI NUDES,

119
00:04:17,549 --> 00:04:18,759
JUST TO WIN THE ELECTION.

120
00:04:18,842 --> 00:04:20,302
YOU'RE LOOKING AT THIS
ALL WRONG.

121
00:04:20,385 --> 00:04:22,054
WHEN MY PARENTS SPLIT,
I GOT A LOT OF STUFF.

122
00:04:22,137 --> 00:04:23,805
I ASKED FOR A PONY!

123
00:04:23,889 --> 00:04:24,848
YOUR PARENTS GOT YOU
A PONY?

124
00:04:24,932 --> 00:04:26,642
WELL, HE WAS STUFFED,

125
00:04:26,725 --> 00:04:27,809
BUT I REALLY WANTED HIM
AT THE TIME.

126
00:04:27,893 --> 00:04:29,061
I DON'T WANT HIS MONEY.

127
00:04:29,144 --> 00:04:30,812
SHAY:
HE DID DRAMA UP YOUR DAY.

128
00:04:30,896 --> 00:04:34,316
YOU COULDN'T EVEN ENJOY
YOUR CAKE-SHAKE!

129
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:37,194
LOLA:
YOU HAVE TO MAKE HIM PAY...
WITH MONEY.

130
00:04:41,782 --> 00:04:44,117
GUYS THINK WE'RE LESBIANS
FOR THEIR BENEFIT!

131
00:04:44,201 --> 00:04:45,327
LIKE WE EXIST
FOR THEIR AROUSAL!

132
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:47,538
IT'S TOTALLY HOMOPHOBIC!

133
00:04:47,621 --> 00:04:50,082
IF YOU'RE SAYING DAMON
WAS MAKING HOMOPHOBIC REMARKS,

134
00:04:50,165 --> 00:04:51,834
WE'LL NEED TO GET
PARENTS INVOLVED.

135
00:04:51,917 --> 00:04:54,378

GOOD! THEY SHOULD KNOW
THEY'RE RAISING A CREEP!

MS. PILL:
YOUR PARENTS, AS WELL.
BOTH OF YOU.

137
00:04:59,883 --> 00:05:01,927
TO BE CLEAR, YOU BOTH FELT
PERSONALLY VICTIMIZED

138
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:03,387
BY THIS STUDENT?

139
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:04,179
IMOGEN: ABSOLUTELY.
JACK: NO.

140
00:05:04,263 --> 00:05:06,348
I'M SORRY, WHAT?!

141
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:09,184
IT WAS JUST A DUMB BOY
MOUTHING OFF.

142
00:05:09,268 --> 00:05:10,018
MS. PILL:
I'M NOT COMFORTABLE
PURSUING THIS

143
00:05:10,102 --> 00:05:11,186
IF THERE ARE DISCREPANCIES,

144
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:12,771
SEEING AS I DIDN'T WITNESS IT.

145
00:05:12,855 --> 00:05:14,815
THERE ARE NO DISCREPANCIES!
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED.

146
00:05:14,898 --> 00:05:15,858
CHECK THE CAMERAS!

147
00:05:15,941 --> 00:05:17,109
YOU'RE OVERREACTING.

148
00:05:22,823 --> 00:05:24,533
WHAT THE HELL
WAS THAT?!

149
00:05:24,616 --> 00:05:25,993
JUST DROP IT, OKAY?

150
00:05:26,076 --> 00:05:28,078
YOU BETRAYED ME, JACK.
I CAN'T JUST DROP THAT!

151
00:05:35,377 --> 00:05:37,546
FRANKIE:
THIS IS NEVER GOING TO WORK.

MR. HOLLINGSWORTH:
MAYOR HOLLINGSWORTH.

153
00:05:38,172 --> 00:05:40,090
HEY, DAD.

154
00:05:40,174 --> 00:05:42,217
MR. HOLLINGSWORTH:
FRANKIE? IS EVERYTHING OKAY?

155
00:05:42,301 --> 00:05:44,553
(WHISPERS)
YOU GOT THIS.

156

YEAH, I... JUST FORGOT SOMETHING
FOR MY BIRTHDAY PARTY...

158
00:05:50,392 --> 00:05:51,810
MR. HOLLINGSWORTH:
WELL, I'M SURE I CAN ORDER
THAT.

159
00:05:51,894 --> 00:05:55,022
WAIT, WHAT'D YOUR MOM SAY?

160
00:05:55,105 --> 00:05:56,815
FRANKIE: NO...?
MR. HOLLINGSWORTH: FRANKIE...

161
00:05:56,899 --> 00:05:59,902
BUT I REALLY WANT ONE,
AND IT'S NOT THAT EXPENSIVE.

162
00:05:59,985 --> 00:06:01,987
MR. HOLLINGSWORTH:
OKAY. IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE?

163
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:04,573
UH... PALM TREES WOULD BE NICE

164
00:06:04,656 --> 00:06:07,326

EVERYBODY HAS THOSE.

A PONY! A PONY!

166

334
00:13:33,772 --> 00:13:36,817
MAYA:
THANKS FOR SHOWING UP, TODAY.
NO ONE ELSE WOULD.

335
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:38,777
IT'S LIKE I'M FRIEND REPELLENT!

336
00:13:38,861 --> 00:13:41,822
YOU JUST HAVE TO LET PEOPLE
PAST YOUR HARD-CANDY SHELL

337
00:13:41,905 --> 00:13:43,574
SO THEY CAN SEE
YOUR GOOEY MIDDLE.

338
00:13:43,657 --> 00:13:45,659
I TRIED! I TRIED TO BRING GRACE
HERE TO SHARE SOME GOO!

339
00:13:45,742 --> 00:13:47,953
MAYA, I HEARD YOU.

340
00:13:48,036 --> 00:13:49,454
YOUR INVITE
INCLUDED THE WORDS

341
00:13:49,538 --> 00:13:51,540
"I LITERALLY HAVE
NO-ONE ELSE TO BRING."

342
00:13:51,623 --> 00:13:52,958
MAYA: I DIDN'T SAY THAT...
ZIG: (LAUGHING) YEAH.

343
00:13:53,041 --> 00:13:55,961
MAYA:
DID I? MAN, I'M BAD AT GIRLS.

344
00:13:56,044 --> 00:13:57,838
ZIG:
(LAUGHING)
YEAH, YOU SAID IT.

345
00:14:01,341 --> 00:14:04,011
ANYWAY, UH... I KINDA CAME HERE
TO TALK ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE.

346
00:14:08,223 --> 00:14:13,228
THIS MORNING,
WHEN I TOLD YOU ABOUT DAMON...

347
00:14:13,312 --> 00:14:15,647
I NEVER WANNA BE THE ONE
THAT MAKES YOU FEEL THAT WAY.

348
00:14:15,731 --> 00:14:17,649
YOU DIDN'T;
DAMON DID.

349
00:14:17,733 --> 00:14:19,610
I KNOW, BUT I'M THE REASON
THAT HE BROKE IN.

350
00:14:22,821 --> 00:14:25,991
(SIGHS) THAT'S WHY
I NEED TO MOVE OUT.

351
00:14:26,074 --> 00:14:29,328
NO. NO.
I CAN'T LOSE YOU.

352
00:14:29,411 --> 00:14:30,996
MAYA, THIS STUFF WITH DAMON,
IT'S SERIOUS.

353
00:14:31,079 --> 00:14:32,372
WHY?
DID HE THREATEN YOU?

354
00:14:32,873 --> 00:14:36,084
NO, BUT HE WAS IN
YOUR HOUSE.

355
00:14:36,168 --> 00:14:38,295
IF ANYTHING EVER HAPPENED TO
YOU BECAUSE OF ME...

356
00:14:38,378 --> 00:14:41,590
YEAH, BUT WHAT'LL HAPPEN
TO YOU, ZIG?

357
00:14:41,673 --> 00:14:46,345
I'VE BEEN MESSED UP FOREVER
BECAUSE OF CAM.

358
00:14:46,428 --> 00:14:50,098
THANKS TO YOU,
I'M FINALLY GETTING PASSED IT.

359
00:14:50,182 --> 00:14:53,268
YOU CAN'T.
I NEED YOU IN MY LIFE, ZIG.

360
00:14:53,352 --> 00:14:56,188
WE'RE SAFE, NOW.
WE HAVE THE ALARM.

361
00:14:56,271 --> 00:14:58,190
PLEASE...

362
00:14:58,273 --> 00:15:00,275
WE CAN PROTECT EACH OTHER,
OKAY?

363
00:15:00,359 --> 00:15:01,944
OKAY?

364
00:15:02,027 --> 00:15:03,904
YEAH.

365
00:15:03,987 --> 00:15:08,116
SO YOU'RE STAYING?

366
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:10,285
SOMEONE'S GOTTA HELP YOU MAKE
THINGS RIGHT WITH GRACE, RIGHT?

367
00:15:10,369 --> 00:15:12,454
(RELIEVED SIGH)

368
00:15:12,538 --> 00:15:14,957

370
00:15:17,376 --> 00:15:19,461
MRS. JONES:
CAN I HELP YOU?

371
00:15:19,545 --> 00:15:21,505
IMOGEN:
I'M LOOKING FOR JACK.

372
00:15:21,588 --> 00:15:22,464
MRS. JONES:
ARE YOU A FRIEND?

373
00:15:22,548 --> 00:15:24,466
NO, I'M IMOGEN,

374
00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:25,467
JACK:
BEST FRIEND.
SHE'S MY BEST FRIEND.

375
00:15:25,551 --> 00:15:27,386
THI- THIS IS MY MOM.

376
00:15:27,469 --> 00:15:29,805
IT'S SO NICE TO MEET YOU,
IMOGEN.

377
00:15:29,888 --> 00:15:32,724
JACK DOESN'T TELL ME AND HER DAD
MUCH ABOUT HER LIFE AT SCHOOL.

378
00:15:32,808 --> 00:15:34,977
JACK:
UH, MOM, YOU WANNA GIVE US
A SEC?

379
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:36,186
IMOGEN AND I HAVE SOME IMPORTANT
HISTORY HOMEWORK TO DISCUSS,

380
00:15:36,270 --> 00:15:38,856
YEAH.

381
00:15:38,939 --> 00:15:39,815
MRS. JONES:
I WOULDN'T WANT TO GET BETWEEN
YOU AND YOUR SCHOOLWORK.

382
00:15:39,898 --> 00:15:40,774
JACK:
YEAH.

383
00:15:44,903 --> 00:15:47,489
IMOGEN:
OKAY, I GET IF YOU'RE STILL MAD
AT ME,

384
00:15:47,573 --> 00:15:49,658
BUT I CAME HERE TO APOLOGIZE
FOR CALLING YOU A JERK.

385
00:15:49,741 --> 00:15:51,660
AND WHILE I WILL CONTINUE
TO BE OUTRAGED BY DUMB IDIOTS,

386
00:15:51,743 --> 00:15:52,452
I CAN'T EXPECT YOU
TO REACT THE SAME,

387
00:15:52,536 --> 00:15:53,412
SO IT'S FINE.

388
00:15:53,495 --> 00:15:55,080
(GROCERIES RUSTLE)

389
00:15:55,163 --> 00:15:57,583
I'M NOT OUT
TO MY PARENTS.

390
00:15:57,666 --> 00:16:00,085
IMOGEN: WHAT?
JACK: THEY DON'T KNOW I'M GAY.

391
00:16:00,169 --> 00:16:01,795
(APPROACHING FOOTSTEPS)

392
00:16:01,879 --> 00:16:04,381
MRS. JONES:
IMOGEN, WOULD YOU LIKE
TO COME IN?

393
00:16:04,464 --> 00:16:06,967
WE JUST BOUGHT ALL SORTS
OF ICE CREAM.

394
00:16:07,050 --> 00:16:09,970
IMOGEN: NO... I NEED TO GO HOME.
JACK: IMOGEN-

395
00:16:10,053 --> 00:16:11,805
IMOGEN:
I HAVE A REALLY IMPORTANT
CLOSET TO CLEAN OUT!

396
00:16:16,768 --> 00:16:18,854
FRANKIE:
I'M GONNA EAT SO MANY CREPES.

397
00:16:18,937 --> 00:16:20,689
WINSTON:
CORRECTION: ALL THE POUTINE.

398
00:16:20,772 --> 00:16:23,567
FRANKIE:
MMM... CHEESE CURDS.

399
00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:24,902
THERE'S NO-ONE ELSE
I'D RATHER HAVE HERE.

400
00:16:24,985 --> 00:16:26,236
THANK YOU.

401
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:29,198
(KISS)

402
00:16:29,281 --> 00:16:33,202
(SOMEONE CLEARS THEIR THROAT,
APPROACHING HEELS CLACK)

403
00:16:33,285 --> 00:16:34,995
MRS. HOLLINGSWORTH:
WINSTON, CAN WE HAVE A MOMENT?

404
00:16:40,834 --> 00:16:42,503
YOU DITCHED
YOUR OWN BIRTHDAY PARTY?

405
00:16:42,586 --> 00:16:44,046
I HAD TO GET AWAY.

406
00:16:44,129 --> 00:16:45,339
MRS. HOLLINGSWORTH:
FAR AWAY, APPARENTLY.

407
00:16:45,422 --> 00:16:47,925
SO YOU RENTED THE PLANE?

408
00:16:48,008 --> 00:16:50,928
WHERE WERE YOU
GONNA GO?

409
00:16:51,011 --> 00:16:52,721
FRANKIE: MONTREAL.
MRS. H: I DON'T UNDERSTAND,
FRANKIE.

410
00:16:52,804 --> 00:16:54,056
YOU GOT EVERYTHING
YOU WANTED TODAY.

411
00:16:54,139 --> 00:16:57,434
YEAH,, AND THE ONE THING
I DIDN'T.

412
00:16:57,518 --> 00:17:00,479
THIS IS ABOUT
YOUR FATHER.

413
00:17:00,562 --> 00:17:02,814
SEEING HIM GIVES ME
A STOMACHACHE.

414
00:17:02,898 --> 00:17:06,485
IT'S TOO HARD.

415
00:17:06,568 --> 00:17:09,530
I KNOW THIS SEPARATION
IT'S WEIRD AND IT'S DIFFICULT,

416
00:17:09,613 --> 00:17:11,782
BUT HE'S YOUR DAD.

417
00:17:11,865 --> 00:17:13,116
HE WANTS TO BE PART
OF YOUR LIFE.

418
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:15,744
AND I WANT HIM
NOT BE A JERK!

419
00:17:15,827 --> 00:17:17,246
MILES GETS TO CHOOSE
WHETHER HE SEES HIM OR NOT

420
00:17:17,329 --> 00:17:20,916
BECAUSE HE'S SIXTEEN.

421
00:17:20,999 --> 00:17:22,668
I WANT THAT CHOICE, TOO.

422
00:17:26,004 --> 00:17:29,299
OKAY.

423
00:17:29,383 --> 00:17:30,592
FRANKIE: REALLY?
MRS. HOLLINGSWORTH: MM-HMM.

424
00:17:30,676 --> 00:17:32,302
I DON'T HAVE TO SEE HIM
ANYMORE?

425
00:17:32,386 --> 00:17:36,431
AS LONG AS YOU CAN
TELL HIM THAT YOURSELF.

426
00:17:36,515 --> 00:17:38,809
AND BY THE WAY,
YOU'RE GROUNDED.

427
00:17:55,701 --> 00:17:57,452
MR. HOLLINGSWORTH:
YOUR MOTHER SAID
YOU WANTED TO SEE ME?

428
00:17:59,746 --> 00:18:02,499
I DON'T WANT TO SPEND TIME
WITH YOU ANYMORE.

429
00:18:02,624 --> 00:18:04,585
AND YOU CAN TAKE
THIS BACK.

430
00:18:08,505 --> 00:18:11,175
YOU DIDN'T LIKE IT?

431
00:18:11,258 --> 00:18:13,177
I DON'T WANNA BE BOUGHT.

432
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:17,014
IT DIDN'T COST ME
A CENT.

433
00:18:17,097 --> 00:18:18,599
IT'S A...

434
00:18:21,310 --> 00:18:25,814
THIS, UM,
WAS MY GRANDMOTHER'S.

435
00:18:25,898 --> 00:18:29,526
SHE, UH, WORE IT
IN THE TWENTIES.

436
00:18:29,610 --> 00:18:32,279
(EMOTIONAL)
I JUST THOUGHT...

437
00:18:32,362 --> 00:18:36,533
I JUST THOUGHT IT WOULD BE
PERFECT FOR YOUR PARTY.

438
00:18:36,617 --> 00:18:40,245
DAD, YOU WANTED ME TO TAKE
THE FALL FOR DEGRASSI NUDES

439
00:18:40,329 --> 00:18:43,207
TO WIN THE ELECTION.

440
00:18:43,290 --> 00:18:46,793
YOU WERE GONNA RUIN MY LIFE
FOR YOUR OWN SELFISH GAINS.

441
00:18:46,877 --> 00:18:48,295
I KNOW, I KNOW, BUT...

442
00:18:48,378 --> 00:18:49,546
IF YOU WOULD JUST PLEASE
LET ME EXPLAIN.

443
00:18:49,630 --> 00:18:51,256
NO, DAD, I DON'T WANT
ANOTHER EXCUSE!

444
00:18:53,383 --> 00:18:54,551
FRANKIE...

445
00:18:54,635 --> 00:18:55,969
FRANKIE:
(CRYING)

446
00:19:01,683 --> 00:19:03,393
YOU'VE NEVER EVEN SAID
YOU WERE SORRY.

447
00:19:03,477 --> 00:19:04,603
MR. HOLLINGSWORTH:
I AM.

448
00:19:04,686 --> 00:19:09,066
I AM... I AM...
I'M JUST SO, SO SORRY.

449
00:19:09,149 --> 00:19:11,360
MY GOD, I'VE MESSED UP IN
MORE WAYS THAN I CAN COUNT.

450
00:19:11,443 --> 00:19:13,237
I'M SO SORRY.

451
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:16,406
PLEASE, JUST...
LET ME FIX THINGS.

452
00:19:16,490 --> 00:19:18,492
GIVE ME ANOTHER CHANCE.

453
00:19:22,579 --> 00:19:24,206
YOU CAN'T FORCE DROP-INS
LIKE YESTERDAY,

454
00:19:24,289 --> 00:19:26,375
BIRTHDAY OR NO.

455
00:19:26,458 --> 00:19:28,252
AND NO MORE TRYING
TO BUY ME OFF.

456
00:19:28,335 --> 00:19:30,754
I'M WILLING TO WORK,
FRANKIE.

457
00:19:30,838 --> 00:19:33,799
THEN I'M WILLING
TO WORK TOO.

458
00:19:33,882 --> 00:19:36,260
AND I PROMISE
NO MORE SPENDING SPREES.

459
00:19:39,972 --> 00:19:43,475
BUT, UM...
YOU'LL KEEP THE NECKLACE?

ABOUT YESTERDAY.

463

THEY'LL GO RUNNING
FOR THE HILLS.
