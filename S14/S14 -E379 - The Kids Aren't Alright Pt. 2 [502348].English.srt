YOU SNITCHED!

341
00:16:10,929 --> 00:16:13,432
OKAY, LET'S TALK ABOUT THIS,
ALL RIGHT? BUT LET HER LEAVE.

342
00:16:13,515 --> 00:16:15,350
SHE'S NOT GOING ANYWHERE!

343
00:16:15,434 --> 00:16:17,561
ZIG:
LISTEN, EVERYTHING
IS GOING TO BE OKAY,

344
00:16:17,644 --> 00:16:19,646
I DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING
ABOUT YOU TO THE COPS,

345
00:16:19,730 --> 00:16:20,397
THEY DON'T EVEN KNOW
YOU WERE THERE!

346
00:16:21,106 --> 00:16:23,192
YOU DON'T GET IT!

347
00:16:23,275 --> 00:16:25,861
VINCE IS GONE,
AND IT'S ALL YOUR FAULT!

348
00:16:25,944 --> 00:16:28,155
MY DAD'S IN PRISON,

349
00:16:28,238 --> 00:16:29,573
MY MOM'S SO HIGH
MOST OF THE TIME,

350
00:16:29,656 --> 00:16:31,825
SHE BARELY REMEMBERS MY NAME!

351
00:16:31,909 --> 00:16:33,785
VINCE WAS ALL I HAD.

352
00:16:33,869 --> 00:16:37,497
HE TOOK CARE OF ME!

353
00:16:37,581 --> 00:16:40,083
ZIG:
WELL...

354
00:16:40,167 --> 00:16:44,213
YOU'RE NOT ALONE,
ALL RIGHT?

355
00:16:44,296 --> 00:16:46,089
YOU'VE GOT ME.

356
00:16:46,173 --> 00:16:47,341
THE GUY WHO RATTED
ON MY BROTHER!

357
00:16:47,424 --> 00:16:48,800
BECAUSE HE SHOT A DUDE!

358
00:16:48,884 --> 00:16:50,302
THE DUDE WHO STABBED ME!

359
00:16:50,385 --> 00:16:52,763
ZIG:
AND NOW YOU'RE THE ONE
WITH THE KNIFE!

360
00:16:52,846 --> 00:16:55,057
COME ON T,
YOU'RE NOT THIS PERSON.

361
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:58,101
MAYBE I AM BECAUSE NO MATTER
HOW HARD I TRY

362
00:16:58,185 --> 00:17:01,146
TO GET AWAY FROM THIS MESS,
IT KEEPS FINDING ME!

363
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:03,815
AND HOW IS HURTING ME
OR MAYA GONNA FIX THAT?

364
00:17:10,155 --> 00:17:11,573
I-I DON'T KNOW, I...

365
00:17:11,657 --> 00:17:13,492
EXACTLY!

366
00:17:17,412 --> 00:17:19,915
WE NEED TO STOP
THIS STUPID CYCLE.

367
00:17:19,998 --> 00:17:23,293
AND WE CAN.

368
00:17:23,377 --> 00:17:26,588
TOGETHER.

369
00:17:26,672 --> 00:17:28,507

SIMON!

378
00:18:05,419 --> 00:18:07,629
YOU DON'T HAVE TO
IF YOU DON'T WANT TO.

379
00:18:07,713 --> 00:18:11,091
(LAUGHS)

381
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,393
YEAH, OKAY, BYE.

382
00:18:25,355 --> 00:18:27,524
JOSE SAID THAT WE COULD
STAY WITH HIM FOR A WHILE.

383
00:18:27,608 --> 00:18:29,109
SO WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN NOW?

384
00:18:29,193 --> 00:18:31,486
HE'S GONNA DO SOME OF HIS
GANG-INTERVENING OR WHATEVER?

385
00:18:31,570 --> 00:18:33,947
UH YEAH,
YEAH, I GUESS.

386
00:18:34,031 --> 00:18:35,407
HE WANTS TO MAKE SURE THAT
WE FLY UNDER THE RADAR

387
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:37,326
WHILE WE COOPERATE
WITH THE COPS.

388
00:18:37,409 --> 00:18:40,579
WAIT, YOU GUYS AREN'T
GETTING CHARGED, RIGHT?

389
00:18:40,662 --> 00:18:42,039
WELL, THE DETECTIVE
SAID COOPERATING

390
00:18:42,122 --> 00:18:44,041
WILL MAKE CUTTING
A DEAL EASIER, BUT...

391
00:18:44,124 --> 00:18:45,918
BUT THERE ARE NO GUARANTEES.

392
00:18:46,001 --> 00:18:48,712
IT WAS STILL THE RIGHT
THING TO DO.

393
00:18:48,795 --> 00:18:50,589
WASN'T IT?

394
00:18:50,672 --> 00:18:52,216
TINY:
YEAH.

395
00:18:52,299 --> 00:18:55,302
IT WAS.

396
00:18:55,385 --> 00:18:56,803
LISTEN MAN, I'M SORRY.

397
00:18:56,887 --> 00:18:59,473
DON'T APOLOGIZE.

398
00:18:59,556 --> 00:19:02,809
I GET IT.

399
00:19:02,893 --> 00:19:04,436
LOOK BLONDIE, I-

400
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:08,232
I'LL BE OKAY, AS LONG
AS YOU GUYS WILL BE, TOO.

401
00:19:08,315 --> 00:19:10,484
(SIGHS) YEAH.

402
00:19:10,567 --> 00:19:14,071
WE WILL.

403
00:19:14,154 --> 00:19:15,572
WE SHOULD HEAD TO JOSE'S.

404
00:19:15,656 --> 00:19:19,159
YEAH... YEAH.

405
00:19:19,243 --> 00:19:22,496
BUT I NEED TO STOP
SOMEWHERE FIRST.

THAT JOKE AT THE END
OF THE THIRD SCENE,

409
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:34,967
YOU GOT SO MANY LAUGHS!

410
00:19:35,050 --> 00:19:36,009
WELL, THAT WAS NOTHING
COMPARED TO YOUR SOLO,

411
00:19:36,093 --> 00:19:39,805
YOU TOTALLY KILLED IT!

412
00:19:39,888 --> 00:19:41,974
HEY, UM...

413
00:19:42,057 --> 00:19:45,435
THANKS FOR COMING THROUGH,
IT MEANT A LOT TO ME.

414
00:19:45,519 --> 00:19:47,437
AND IF YOU WANT US TO GO
OUR SEPARATE WAYS, I-

415
00:19:47,521 --> 00:19:49,439
WINSTON...
SHUT UP.

416

(LAUGHS)

418
00:20:06,790 --> 00:20:08,792
YOU GOT MY MESSAGE.

419
00:20:08,876 --> 00:20:10,711
TWO CHEESEBURGERS, NO ONIONS.

420
00:20:10,794 --> 00:20:14,047
(BOTH LAUGH)

421
00:20:14,131 --> 00:20:17,593
WHAT, ARE YOU TRYING TO POISON
ME NOW, OR SOMETHING?

422
00:20:17,676 --> 00:20:18,552
UH NO, I JUST THOUGHT
YOU MIGHT WANT-

423
00:20:18,635 --> 00:20:20,345
I'M JUST MESSING WITH YOU.

424
00:20:20,429 --> 00:20:23,807

425
00:20:23,891 --> 00:20:25,726
SO, UH...

426
00:20:25,809 --> 00:20:28,687
THE COPS PICKED VINCE UP.

427
00:20:28,770 --> 00:20:30,606
THEY THINK THE CHARGES'LL HOLD.

428
00:20:30,689 --> 00:20:32,274
SO IT'S OVER?

429
00:20:32,357 --> 00:20:34,026
FOR NOW.

430
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:39,364
WHAT, YOU GONNA MAKE ME
EAT BOTH OF THESE?

431
00:20:39,448 --> 00:20:41,158
(LAUGHS)

432
00:20:44,328 --> 00:20:45,746
