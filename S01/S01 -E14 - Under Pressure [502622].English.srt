00:00:03,977 --> 00:00:05,579
CATHODE RAY TUBE.

2
00:00:07,514 --> 00:00:11,452
CATHODE RAY TUBE- UH - WAS DEVELOPED... WHEN?

3
00:00:13,754 --> 00:00:18,025
1897. AND WHEN WAS THE FIRST TELEVISED BROADCAST?

4
00:00:20,294 --> 00:00:21,028
UM... 1956?

5
00:00:22,496 --> 00:00:23,697
CLOSE. '36.

6
00:00:25,099 --> 00:00:26,734
YEAH, ONLY TWO DECADES OFF.

7
00:00:28,802 --> 00:00:33,607
HEY- CUT YOURSELF SOME SLACK, THIS IS HARD STUFF TO REMEMBER.

8
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:37,778
YOU'RE DOING THAT WRONG. C'MON. LET ME. TAKE A SEAT.

9
00:00:43,884 --> 00:00:46,820
SO MOM CALLED. SHE'S OFF THE BOOZE.

10
00:00:48,789 --> 00:00:50,224
GOOD FOR HER.

11
00:00:50,257 --> 00:00:52,526
YEAH, WELL I'M JUST WARNING YOU BECAUSE SHE UH-

12
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:54,528
WANTED TO TALK TO YOU.

13
00:00:54,561 --> 00:00:58,599
WHICH MEANS THAT SHE'S GONNA BE CALLING BACK AND --

14
00:00:58,632 --> 00:01:00,501
-- AND SHE'S GONNA WANNA TALK TO ME ABOUT MOVING BACK

15
00:01:00,534 --> 00:01:01,602
WITH THEM TO WASAGA BEACH.

16
00:01:01,635 --> 00:01:05,239
WELL, IT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN, ALRIGHT? FORGET IT.

17
00:01:05,272 --> 00:01:05,672
SEAN --

18
00:01:07,207 --> 00:01:08,842
--I'M NOT MOVING BACK!

19
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:11,378
HEY -- TAKE IT EASY.

20
00:01:12,846 --> 00:01:15,616
USE SOME OF THOSE TRICKS THEY TAUGHT YOU.

21
00:01:15,649 --> 00:01:20,320
OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU ARE NOT MY SOCIAL WORKER, OKAY?

22
00:01:20,754 --> 00:01:23,590
LOOK. DON'T WORRY ABOUT MOM, OKAY?

23
00:01:27,594 --> 00:01:31,532
YOU JUST KEEP YOUR NOSE CLEAN, GET GOOD GRADES-

24
00:01:31,565 --> 00:01:34,701
AND EVERYTHING'LL BE OKAY. ALRIGHT?

25
00:01:38,539 --> 00:01:39,673
ALRIGHT.

26
00:01:39,773 --> 00:01:41,842
♪ WHAT EVER IT TAKES

27
00:01:43,377 --> 00:01:46,213

28
00:01:48,615 --> 00:01:50,217

♪ I KNOW I CAN MAKE IT THROUGH

36
00:02:20,447 --> 00:02:23,183
THIS MEDIA IMMERSION TEST IS GONNA KILL ME.

37
00:02:23,217 --> 00:02:27,254
SO DEAD, THEY'LL HAVE TO CHECK MY DENTAL RECORDS, MY DNA-

38
00:02:27,287 --> 00:02:29,556
WOULD YOU STOP BEING SO MELODRAMATIC FOR ONCE?

39
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:31,658
PLEASE?!

40
00:02:31,692 --> 00:02:33,727
I'M NOT MELODRAMATIC.

41
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:36,530
J.T., TRY STUDYING. IT HELPS.

42
00:02:36,563 --> 00:02:39,533
EMMA. YOU SAID YOU'D HELP ME STUDY FOR THE TEST, RIGHT?

43
00:02:39,566 --> 00:02:40,701
SURE, I'D LOVE TO.

44
00:02:40,734 --> 00:02:42,803
ARE YOU WORRIED ABOUT MEDIA IMMERSION?

45
00:02:42,836 --> 00:02:44,371
BIG TIME.

46
00:02:45,672 --> 00:02:48,675
OH, MR. SIMPSON. TWENTIETH CENTURY MEDIA HISTORY

47
00:02:48,709 --> 00:02:50,577
IS A MAJOR COMPONENT OF THIS TEST.

48
00:02:50,611 --> 00:02:52,846
DO WE NEED TO ANYTHING BEFORE THAT?

49
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:54,515
LIKE THE GUTTENBERG PRESS?

50
00:02:54,548 --> 00:02:57,417
NO, LIBERTY. JUST WHAT WE STUDIED.

51
00:02:57,451 --> 00:02:58,619
BECAUSE I KNOW THE GUTTENBERG PRESS.

52
00:02:58,652 --> 00:03:01,255
I'M SURE YOU DO. I SHOULD, UH-

53
00:03:01,288 --> 00:03:05,425
NOW- MATH'S NOT MY STRONG SUIT. BUT IF I WANT AN A+

54
00:03:05,459 --> 00:03:09,263
IN MEDIA IMMERSION, I'LL HAVE TO SCORE ABOUT 92.48%

55
00:03:09,296 --> 00:03:13,700
ON THIS TEST. DOES THAT CALCULATION SOUND RIGHT TO YOU?

56
00:03:14,535 --> 00:03:16,637
DID YOU GUYS JUST HEAR MR. RADITCH CALL ME?

57
00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:19,540
YEAH, I THINK HEARD HIM CALL ME.

58
00:03:21,875 --> 00:03:24,711
HEY SEAN, GONNA MISS THAT LOCKER, EH?

59
00:03:24,745 --> 00:03:27,514
WHAT'S THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

60
00:03:27,548 --> 00:03:29,516
NOTHING, IT'S JUST YOU'LL BE MOVING TO GRADE EIGHT

61
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:30,951
NEXT YEAR, FINALLY.

62
00:03:31,585 --> 00:03:33,520
YEAH, FINALLY.

63
00:03:33,987 --> 00:03:35,255
YEAH.

64
00:03:36,723 --> 00:03:38,926
PAIGE! CHECK THIS OUT!

65
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:40,861
SPINNER, WE'RE GOING TO BE LATE AND RADITCH

66
00:03:40,894 --> 00:03:42,729
IS GOING TO EXPEL YOU.

67
00:03:43,664 --> 00:03:46,366
SO? ANYTHING TO GET ME OUT OF THAT ENGLISH TEST.

68
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,801
I THOUGHT YOU READ ALL THE BOOKS.

69
00:03:47,834 --> 00:03:50,571
YEAH. ONCE. NOW I'M SUPPOSED TO REVIEW THEM FOR THE TEST?

70
00:03:50,604 --> 00:03:53,674
FORGET IT. I'VE DONE ENOUGH WORK.

71
00:03:53,707 --> 00:03:58,545
UGH! HURRY UP. YOU KNOW WHAT A FASCIST RADITCH IS-

72
00:04:01,915 --> 00:04:04,718
PAIGE, GAVIN, YOU'RE LATE.

73
00:04:04,751 --> 00:04:07,588
I SEE SOME THINGS HAVEN'T CHANGED.

74
00:04:15,095 --> 00:04:18,065
...AND I KNOW THAT I SPEAK FOR ALL OF DEGRASSI WHEN I SAY-

75
00:04:18,098 --> 00:04:20,734
WELCOME BACK, MS. KWAN. WE MISSED YOU.

76
00:04:20,767 --> 00:04:23,036
THANK YOU, MR. RADITCH.

77
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:25,672
OKAY, THEN, WHERE TO START...

78
00:04:26,773 --> 00:04:28,475
YES, TERRI?

79
00:04:29,576 --> 00:04:31,745
UM... I KNOW IT'S NONE OF MY BUSINESS, BUT...

80
00:04:31,778 --> 00:04:33,614
IS EVERYTHING ALRIGHT?

81
00:04:34,448 --> 00:04:37,651
YES. MY HUSBAND'S FINISHED ALL HIS CHEMO,

82
00:04:38,685 --> 00:04:40,087
AND GETTING BETTER EACH DAY.

83
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:42,723
NOW - HOW HAVE YOUR TESTS BEEN?

84
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:46,560
LOOK ON THE BRIGHT SIDE. I MEAN THERE'S ONLY ONE TEST LEFT.

85
00:04:46,593 --> 00:04:48,662
MINE. WHAT'S WRONG OSKAR?

86
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:54,801
I'M NOT FEELING VERY WELL, MS. KWAN. CAN I BE EXCUSED?

87
00:04:57,871 --> 00:05:00,707
I HOPE OSKAR'S NOT COMING DOWN WITH THIS FLU.

88
00:05:00,741 --> 00:05:04,711
THESE BUGS SEEM TO FLOURISH IN TIMES OF STRESS.

89
00:05:04,745 --> 00:05:07,347
OKAY, LET'S START OUR REVIEW...

90
00:05:12,119 --> 00:05:14,855
SO I'LL JUST GRAB MY BOOK.

91
00:05:15,789 --> 00:05:18,058
WHY DON'T WE JUST STUDY HERE INSTEAD?

92
00:05:18,091 --> 00:05:21,361
UH... TRACKER FIXES MOTORCYCLES - IT'LL BE NOISY.

93
00:05:21,395 --> 00:05:23,030
OKAY. WHATEVER.

94
00:05:23,797 --> 00:05:27,868
UM- WOULD YOU MIND... IF YOU WAITED OUTSIDE?

95
00:05:29,603 --> 00:05:32,673
MY PLACE ISN'T LIKE YOURS. IT'S A DUMP.

96
00:05:33,407 --> 00:05:36,743
OKAY, SURE. I'LL WAIT RIGHT HERE.

97
00:05:47,421 --> 00:05:49,956
HEY. SO, WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

98
00:05:52,459 --> 00:05:54,428
A NEW REPORT FOR YOUR SCHOOL NEWSPAPER?

99
00:05:54,461 --> 00:05:57,731
LIFE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE TRACKS?

100
00:05:57,764 --> 00:06:00,834
NO, I'M WAITING FOR SEAN. WE'RE STUDYING TOGETHER TONIGHT.

101
00:06:00,867 --> 00:06:02,602
OH YEAH? WHAT DO YOU THINK?

102
00:06:02,636 --> 00:06:06,440
YOU'RE BEING A GOOD INFLUENCE OR SOMETHING?

103
00:06:07,574 --> 00:06:12,446
'CAUSE YOU ARE. HE HASN'T GOTTEN INTO TROUBLE THIS YEAR.

104
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,749
THAT'S GOOD. SO - THANKS.

105
00:06:16,616 --> 00:06:18,719
TROUBLE? WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

106
00:06:18,752 --> 00:06:22,556
OH, DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT. IT'S IN THE PAST.

107
00:06:23,757 --> 00:06:26,693
HE'S A DIFFERENT KIND OF KID NOW.

108
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:31,932
WHAT WERE YOU GUYS JUST TALKING ABOUT?

109
00:06:31,965 --> 00:06:34,735
NOTHING. SO, YOU GUYS ARE GOING TO GO STUDY TOGETHER?

110
00:06:34,768 --> 00:06:36,703
YEAH. C'MON, EM.

111

OKAY, REPEAT AFTER ME. SHOOTBAC.

112
00:06:44,177 --> 00:06:47,447
SHOOTBAC? IS THAT ON THE TEST?

113
00:06:48,248 --> 00:06:50,450
NO, I MADE IT UP.

114
00:06:50,484 --> 00:06:52,486
THE CONSONANTS - STAND FOR THE HTML TAGS

115
00:06:52,519 --> 00:06:54,755
USED IN A WEB PAGE. S IS FOR STARTING, H FOR HEAD,

116
00:06:54,788 --> 00:06:57,791
T - TITLE, B - BODY AND C - CLOSING.

117
00:06:58,792 --> 00:07:02,596
I ADDED VOWELS TO MAKE IT EASY TO REMEMBER. SHOOTBAC!

118
00:07:02,629 --> 00:07:04,664
YOU ARE SUCH A LIBERTY!

119
00:07:04,698 --> 00:07:06,833
I AM NOT. IT'S CALLED MNEMONICS.

120
00:07:06,867 --> 00:07:09,870
ALRIGHT, LIBERTY. WHATEVER, LIBERTY.

121
00:07:17,677 --> 00:07:20,480
YOU WANT TO MESS WITH ME? I'LL MESS YOU UP.

122
00:07:20,514 --> 00:07:22,582
I'M BIG TROUBLE. HEH-HEH.

123
00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:25,218
YEAH. I HEARD.

124
00:07:28,054 --> 00:07:29,523
YOU HEARD WHAT?

125
00:07:30,157 --> 00:07:34,528
JUST- TRACKER JUST SAID YOU GOT INTO TROUBLE ONCE.

126
00:07:36,596 --> 00:07:39,666
HE DIDN'T GIVE ME THE DETAILS.

127
00:07:45,105 --> 00:07:46,106
OKAY.

128
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:51,945
BACK IN WASAGA BEACH I GOT INTO A FIGHT WITH THIS GUY.

129
00:07:53,013 --> 00:07:55,749
MESSED UP HIS HEARING PRETTY BAD.

130
00:07:55,782 --> 00:07:57,150
YOU MADE HIM DEAF?

131
00:07:57,184 --> 00:07:59,119
YEAH, YEAH. IN ONE EAR,

132
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:01,721
PERMANENTLY?

133
00:08:03,590 --> 00:08:06,760
I'M NOT PROUD OF WHAT I DID, YOU KNOW?

134
00:08:08,595 --> 00:08:12,065
SOMETIMES I JUST GET REALLY REALLY MAD AND--

135
00:08:15,836 --> 00:08:18,171
BUT I'M WORKING ON IT, OKAY?

136
00:08:18,905 --> 00:08:21,775

137
00:08:21,808 --> 00:08:23,510
YEAH, YEAH IT WAS.

00:08:25,812 --> 00:08:27,514
WHAT'S THAT SMELL?

139
00:08:28,582 --> 00:08:29,983
OH NO! THE POPCORN!

140
00:08:34,855 --> 00:08:37,858
HOW ABOUT WE HAVE CORN-NUTS INSTEAD?

141
00:08:44,364 --> 00:08:46,700
SO, ARE YOU NERVOUS?

142
00:08:46,733 --> 00:08:47,734
YEAH.

143
00:08:49,669 --> 00:08:51,671

THE TEST AUTOMATICALLY ENDS WHEN TIME'S UP. GOOD LUCK.

151
00:09:27,274 --> 00:09:30,844
SPINNER, I TOLD YOU. I DON'T WANT TO HEAR ANY STUPID IDEAS.

152
00:09:30,877 --> 00:09:34,047
AND GETTING SICK, ON PURPOSE? QUALIFIES.

153
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,650
PAIGE, YOU SURE YOU'RE NOT PSYCHIC?

154
00:09:36,683 --> 00:09:38,385
'CAUSE YOU JUST READ MY MIND.

155
00:09:38,418 --> 00:09:40,120
AH CHOO!

157
00:09:47,661 --> 00:09:49,062
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

158
00:09:52,299 --> 00:09:53,733
NOT A GOOD IDEA, SPINNER.

159
00:09:53,767 --> 00:09:55,635
I THINK I'VE GOT WHAT OSKAR HAD.

160
00:09:55,669 --> 00:09:57,637
WHAT KIND OF FRIEND WOULD I BE IF I LET

161
00:09:57,671 --> 00:10:00,740
A SILLY LITTLE FLU VIRUS COME BETWEEN US?

162
00:10:00,774 --> 00:10:04,311
SORRY I'M LATE, GUYS. I JUST FINISHED MARKING YOUR TESTS

164
00:10:07,714 --> 00:10:10,850
HOWEVER, SOME SCORES WERE DISAPPOINTING.

00:10:14,354 --> 00:10:15,755

176
00:11:08,341 --> 00:11:09,743
NO. I'M NOT DONE.

177
00:11:12,012 --> 00:11:14,080
FORTY-FIVE MINUTES, REMEMBER?

178
00:11:14,114 --> 00:11:15,482
BUT - I'M NOT FINISHED!

179
00:11:15,515 --> 00:11:18,118
TIME'S UP. YOU'RE LOCKED OUT.

180
00:11:22,088 --> 00:11:24,124
SEE SEAN? IT WASN'T SO HARD.

181
00:11:24,157 --> 00:11:26,026
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

182
00:11:26,059 --> 00:11:27,427
I DIDN'T EVEN HAVE TIME TO FINISH. I FAILED.

183
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:28,695
OH.

184
00:11:28,828 --> 00:11:29,929
I WAS RIGHT. I'M SCREWED.

185
00:11:29,963 --> 00:11:31,297
SEAN, YOU DON'T KNOW THAT.

186
00:11:31,331 --> 00:11:33,466
NO, EMMA. YOU DON'T KNOW. ANYTHING I HAVE EVER TRIED AT-

187
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:34,768
- I HAVE FAILED.

188
00:11:34,801 --> 00:11:37,070
SEAN, COME ON -

189
00:11:37,804 --> 00:11:41,007
YOU KNOW WHAT EMMA? JUST- DON'T TALK TO ME, OKAY?

190
00:11:41,041 --> 00:11:42,776
JUST- LEAVE ME ALONE.

191
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:02,429
AWW- WHAT'S WRONG? FORGOT YOUR COMBO?

192
00:12:02,462 --> 00:12:04,464
YOU SHOULD ASK SPINNER FOR ONE OF HIS RITALIN.

193
00:12:04,497 --> 00:12:06,399
REALLY HELPS SHARPENS THE MEMORY.

194
00:12:06,433 --> 00:12:08,468
WAS THAT A JOKE?

195
00:12:09,135 --> 00:12:10,103
YEAH. RELAX.

196
00:12:10,136 --> 00:12:10,970
DON'T PUSH ME, OKAY?

197
00:12:11,004 --> 00:12:12,839
DUDE, WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM?

198
00:12:12,872 --> 00:12:13,606
WHAT'S MY PROBLEM?

199
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:15,275
YEAH. YOU DO UNDERSTAND ENGLISH?

200
00:12:15,308 --> 00:12:17,110
SO, YOU THINK I'M STUPID?

201
00:12:17,143 --> 00:12:19,412
NO- I THINK YOU'RE A FREAK.

202
00:12:21,014 --> 00:12:25,518
HEY! HEY GUYS- GUYS, WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?

203
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:31,024
NOTHING. WE'RE JUST PLAYING AROUND.

204
00:12:32,425 --> 00:12:35,962
WELL, TONE IT DOWN, ALRIGHT?

205
00:12:39,332 --> 00:12:41,501
I'LL SEE YOU AFTER SCHOOL.

206
00:13:02,589 --> 00:13:06,493
MS. KWAN, I DON'T FEEL SO GOOD.

207
00:13:06,526 --> 00:13:11,798
GAVIN, YOU'RE BURNING UP. YOU BETTER GO SEE THE NURSE.

208
00:13:12,398 --> 00:13:15,502
JIMMY, YOU CAN'T FIGHT SEAN.

209
00:13:15,535 --> 00:13:17,137
THE PSYCHO TOTALLY STARTED IT THE MINUTE HE GOT BACK

210
00:13:17,170 --> 00:13:20,840
TO DEGRASSI. GUESS WHAT - I'M GONNA END IT.

211
00:13:20,874 --> 00:13:22,876
I HEARD HE GOT SENT BACK FROM WASAGA BECAUSE HE GOT IN-

212
00:13:22,909 --> 00:13:25,512
A FIGHT WITH A KID AND DEAFENED HIM IN ONE EAR.

213
00:13:25,545 --> 00:13:29,883
SO IS IT TRUE?! ARE YOU REALLY GONNA FIGHT SEAN?

214
00:13:29,916 --> 00:13:31,417
LIBERTY VAN ZANDT?

215
00:13:31,518 --> 00:13:32,986
HERE.

216
00:13:33,019 --> 00:13:35,121
JAMES TIBERIUS YORKE?

217
00:13:35,155 --> 00:13:37,323
IT'S J.T. AND I'M STILL HERE. DESPITE HOW HARD

218
00:13:37,357 --> 00:13:39,492
THAT MEDIA IMMERSION TEST WAS-

219
00:13:39,526 --> 00:13:42,595
THANK YOU, J.T. TOO MUCH INFORMATION.

220
00:13:42,629 --> 00:13:44,998
AND THAT JUST LEAVES SEAN.

221
00:13:46,065 --> 00:13:47,567
SEAN. YOU'RE LATE.

222
00:13:48,601 --> 00:13:52,372
YEAH, LIKE IT'S THE END OF THE WORLD?

223
00:13:52,405 --> 00:13:54,007
NO, IT'S THE END OF YOUR LUNCH HOUR.

224
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:57,544
WHICH YOU'LL NOW BE SPENDING WITH ME.

225
00:13:57,577 --> 00:13:58,845
GREAT.

226
00:14:07,153 --> 00:14:10,156
98.6, NORMAL BODY TEMPERATURE.

227
00:14:10,190 --> 00:14:13,259
WHAT? BUT - I'M BURNING UP.

228
00:14:14,694 --> 00:14:17,530
YOU ARE A LITTLE WARM.

229
00:14:17,564 --> 00:14:20,033
OF COURSE, YOU COULD'VE BEEN RUNNING AROUND -

230
00:14:20,066 --> 00:14:24,204
NURSE HENDERSON, I'M APPALLED YOU'D EVEN SUGGEST SUCH A THING

231
00:14:24,237 --> 00:14:26,573
MAYBE THAT SPACE-AGE THERMOMETER'S LIKE,

232
00:14:26,606 --> 00:14:28,107
NOT WORKING RIGHT.

233
00:14:29,509 --> 00:14:35,014
WELL, THERE'S ONE TRIED AND TRUE METHOD... FOOL-PROOF.

234
00:14:40,153 --> 00:14:45,892
UM- WHAT ARE YOU DOING? I DON'T WANT THAT GUNK IN MY MOUTH.

235
00:14:48,061 --> 00:14:51,231
NOT GOING IN YOUR MOUTH...

236
00:14:52,665 --> 00:14:56,703
YOU KNOW WHAT? I'M FEELING A LOT BETTER. ALL OF A SUDDEN.

237
00:14:56,736 --> 00:14:57,537
REALLY.

238
00:15:10,483 --> 00:15:13,319
NO NOTE FROM MR. HENDERSON?

239
00:15:19,425 --> 00:15:21,694
GAVIN. WE BOTH KNOW WHAT YOU TRIED TO PULL JUST NOW.

240
00:15:21,728 --> 00:15:23,529
MS. KWAN, I RESENT --

241
00:15:23,563 --> 00:15:26,566
AND I'M GOING TO KEEP THIS BETWEEN US.

242
00:15:26,599 --> 00:15:28,668
PART OF A FRESH START. IN EXCHANGE YOU'LL HEAR ME OUT.

243
00:15:28,701 --> 00:15:30,536
YOU'RE NOT A DUMB KID.

244
00:15:31,371 --> 00:15:33,539
BUT THE STUFF YOU PULL AROUND HERE IS.

245
00:15:33,573 --> 00:15:34,641
IF YOU'D JUST CHANNEL ALL THAT ENERGY INTO YOUR SCHOOLWORK

246
00:15:34,674 --> 00:15:37,110
YOU COULD BE A GOOD STUDENT.

247
00:15:37,143 --> 00:15:41,281
BUT MS. KWAN. THESE TESTS. THEY FREAK ME OUT.

248
00:15:41,314 --> 00:15:42,515
IT MUST BE MY A.D.D.

249
00:15:42,548 --> 00:15:44,617
HAVE YOU TAKEN YOUR RITALIN?

250
00:15:44,651 --> 00:15:45,985
OF COURSE.

251
00:15:46,019 --> 00:15:49,622
THEN IT'S NOT YOUR ADD. GAVIN, I'LL TELL YOU WHAT TO DO.

252
00:15:49,656 --> 00:15:53,159
YOU STOP AVOIDING. YOU BREATHE. YOU FOCUS.

253
00:15:53,192 --> 00:15:57,030
AND YOU TAKE THIS TEST ONE QUESTION AT A TIME.

254
00:16:00,066 --> 00:16:03,603
CLASS? YOU HAVE FORTY-FIVE MINUTES. AND - GO.

255
00:16:13,813 --> 00:16:17,350
I SHOULD HAVE YOUR TESTS BACK TO YOU GUYS BY TOMORROW.

256
00:16:17,383 --> 00:16:20,053
OKAY, OFF TO LUNCH. EXCEPT SEAN.

257
00:16:29,762 --> 00:16:32,198
WHAT'S GOING ON?

258
00:16:32,231 --> 00:16:35,234
JUST BEING MYSELF. A FAILURE.

259
00:16:36,269 --> 00:16:39,739
SEAN - YOU ARE NOT A FAILURE.

260
00:16:39,772 --> 00:16:43,276
OH NO? I TOTALLY SCREWED UP THAT TEST.

261
00:16:43,309 --> 00:16:45,645
NOW, HOW DO YOU KNOW? I HAVEN'T EVEN MARKED IT YET -

262
00:16:45,678 --> 00:16:49,515
DON'T BOTHER. I FAILED. THAT'S MY LIFE.

263
00:16:50,583 --> 00:16:54,354
WHAT DO YOU MEAN, THAT'S YOUR LIFE?

264
00:16:54,387 --> 00:16:57,123
THAT'S JUST THE WAY IT IS.

265
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:02,295
WELL, I GUESS IF YOU BELIEVE THAT,

266
00:17:02,328 --> 00:17:05,331
THEN THAT'S THE WAY IT'S GONNA BE.

267
00:17:05,365 --> 00:17:08,768
OH YEAH! WHO'S THE KING OF THE WORLD! YES.

268
00:17:08,801 --> 00:17:10,503
I PASSED THE TEST.

269
00:17:11,337 --> 00:17:13,606
I ASSUME IT WENT WELL, GAVIN?

270
00:17:13,639 --> 00:17:16,342
I HAD NO IDEA I KNEW AS MUCH AS I DID!

271
00:17:16,376 --> 00:17:19,712
SO YOU SEE WHAT GOOD THINGS HAPPEN WHEN YOU FOCUS?

272
00:17:19,746 --> 00:17:22,448
I OWE IT ALL TO YOU, MS. KWAN!

273
00:17:22,782 --> 00:17:25,184
HEY - WHERE ARE YOU TWO GOING?

274
00:17:25,218 --> 00:17:27,620
SEAN CAMERON WANTS TO FIGHT JIMMY.

275
00:17:27,653 --> 00:17:29,522
THAT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN.

276
00:17:29,555 --> 00:17:32,325
DUDE, YOU'RE WALKING AWAY FROM-

277
00:17:32,358 --> 00:17:34,293
JIMMY. LET'S GO.

278
00:17:34,627 --> 00:17:39,499
LOOK MAN, WE DON'T HAVE TO DO THIS. IT'S STUPID.

279
00:17:40,133 --> 00:17:43,569
MAN, NO WONDER ARMSTRONG CUT YOU FROM THE TEAM.

280
00:17:43,603 --> 00:17:46,172
HE ONLY CUT ME 'CAUSE YOU GOT IN MY WAY. AND FAKED AN INJURY.

281
00:17:46,205 --> 00:17:47,573
YEAH. WHATEVER.

282
00:17:47,607 --> 00:17:49,575
YOU WANNA FIGHT? THEN LET'S FIGHT.

283
00:17:49,609 --> 00:17:52,645
I'LL MEET YOU IN THE ALLEY WAY.

284
00:17:52,678 --> 00:17:55,281
JIMMY, IF YOU DO THIS, DON'T EXPECT ME TO WATCH.

285
00:17:55,314 --> 00:17:58,718
FINE. IT'S GONNA BE UGLY, ANYWAY-

286
00:18:11,164 --> 00:18:12,698
SEAN, STOP IT.

287
00:18:13,433 --> 00:18:14,700
GET OUT OF HERE, EMMA.

288
00:18:14,734 --> 00:18:17,203
EMMA, JUST GO.

289
00:18:17,236 --> 00:18:18,538
WHAT IF RADITCH FINDS OUT?

290
00:18:18,571 --> 00:18:21,374
WE'RE OFF SCHOOL PROPERTY.

291
00:18:21,407 --> 00:18:23,810
PLEASE. BEFORE IT GETS TOO SERIOUS.

292
00:18:23,843 --> 00:18:26,379
FIGHT! FIGHT! FIGHT!

293
00:18:29,215 --> 00:18:32,585
WHAT YOU'RE GONNA CRY NOW, JIMMY, HUH?

294
00:18:32,618 --> 00:18:34,754
FIGHT! FIGHT! FIGHT!

295
00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:02,615
SEAN, LEAVE HIM ALONE!

296
00:19:02,648 --> 00:19:05,251
EMMA, GET OUT OF HERE!

297
00:19:14,494 --> 00:19:14,694
EMMA.

298
00:19:17,597 --> 00:19:18,664
EMMA. I'M S--

299
00:19:27,006 --> 00:19:29,475
...AND THEN THE COWARD WALKS AWAY, AFTER PICKING THE FIGHT

300
00:19:29,509 --> 00:19:31,611
AND THROWING HIS OWN GIRLFRIEND TO THE GROUND-

301
00:19:31,644 --> 00:19:32,345
SEAN DID THAT? TO EMMA?

302
00:19:32,378 --> 00:19:35,548
UH-HUH. TOTAL COWARD.

303
00:19:35,581 --> 00:19:38,584
YEAH, AND YOU'RE SO BRAVE FOR GETTING IN A FIGHT.

304
00:19:38,618 --> 00:19:40,486
ASH, C'MON--

305
00:19:42,288 --> 00:19:43,956
HEY - HOW WAS KWAN'S TEST?

306
00:19:43,990 --> 00:19:45,925
BRUTAL. YOU'RE LUCKY YOU MISSED IT.

307
00:19:45,958 --> 00:19:48,528
MISSED IT? I HAVE TO DO IT TODAY AFTER SCHOOL.

308
00:19:48,561 --> 00:19:50,863
A MAKE-UP ONE. PROBABLY HARDER.

309
00:19:50,897 --> 00:19:53,900
AW, REALLY? POOR TER.

310
00:19:53,933 --> 00:19:56,269
GEE, THANKS FOR THE SYMPATHY.

311
00:19:56,302 --> 00:19:57,403
TODAY IS JUST TOO BEAUTIFUL!

312
00:19:57,436 --> 00:20:00,706
GOT MY WORST SUBJECT OUTTA THE WAY. IT'S THE WEEKEND.

313
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:03,743
MY DAD'S SCORED THESE AMAZING JAY--

314
00:20:03,776 --> 00:20:04,377
A-CHOO!

315
00:20:06,379 --> 00:20:09,382
UH-- THAT'S EXACTLY HOW MY FLU STARTED.

316
00:20:09,415 --> 00:20:11,617
IT'S NOTHING. SOME DUST--

317
00:20:11,651 --> 00:20:12,251
A-CHOO!

318
00:20:13,486 --> 00:20:15,555
AW, POOR SPINNER.

319
00:20:16,422 --> 00:20:18,324
UH, MAYBE WE'LL SEE YOU ON MONDAY.

320
00:20:18,357 --> 00:20:20,860
WHEN YOU'RE NOT SO CONTAGIOUS.

321
00:20:21,827 --> 00:20:25,364
GUYS, COME ON. I'M FINE --

322
00:20:25,398 --> 00:20:26,465
A-CHOO. OH, NO...

323
00:20:29,936 --> 00:20:31,003
SEAN.

324
00:20:35,074 --> 00:20:39,478
SOME GOOD NEWS. I FINISHED MARKING. AND YOU DID WELL.

325
00:20:40,313 --> 00:20:40,513
WHAT?

326
00:20:41,981 --> 00:20:45,651
YOUR BEST MARK YET. IT PULLED YOUR GRADE UP TO A B MINUS.

327
00:20:45,685 --> 00:20:47,453
BUT - I DIDN'T FINISH --

328
00:20:47,486 --> 00:20:50,389
SO? YOU ACED THE REST. IT'S A GOOD JOB.

329
00:20:50,423 --> 00:20:53,059
YOU SHOULD BE PROUD OF YOURSELF.

330
00:20:53,092 --> 00:20:55,561
AND LEARN FROM THIS - OKAY?

331
00:21:00,399 --> 00:21:02,868
EMMA, EMMA! PLEASE. STOP.

332
00:21:08,808 --> 00:21:11,477
EMMA, YESTERDAY WAS WRONG, OKAY?

333
00:21:13,913 --> 00:21:17,049
I JUST GOT MY MARK FROM MR. SIMPSON.

334
00:21:17,083 --> 00:21:18,884
I PASSED AFTER ALL.

335
00:21:21,687 --> 00:21:24,023
I SHOULD'VE LISTENED TO YOU-

336
00:21:24,590 --> 00:21:25,758
AND I'M SORRY.

337
00:21:27,827 --> 00:21:28,427
YEAH.

338
00:21:29,662 --> 00:21:30,396
SO AM I.
