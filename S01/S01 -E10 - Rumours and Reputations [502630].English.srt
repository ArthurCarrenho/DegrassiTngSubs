1
00:00:02,643 --> 00:00:03,610
I'VE JUST GOT TO HAND THIS IN TO ARMSTRONG.

2
00:00:03,644 --> 00:00:05,245
I'LL SEE YOU LATER.

3
00:00:23,497 --> 00:00:24,665
SO I'M TELLING MY MOM THAT JOKE.

4
00:00:24,698 --> 00:00:26,200
YOU KNOW. THE ONE ABOUT THE DUCK?

5
00:00:26,233 --> 00:00:27,601
THAT ONE'S PRETTY GOOD.

6
00:00:27,634 --> 00:00:29,236
AND WHEN I TELL HER THE PUNCHLINE?

7
00:00:29,269 --> 00:00:31,805
SHE SPEWS MILK - OUT OF HER NOSE!

8
00:00:34,375 --> 00:00:38,178
EMMA. MILK. OUT OF MY MOM'S NOSE.

9
00:00:38,212 --> 00:00:38,512
FUNNY.

10
00:00:39,313 --> 00:00:42,316
HUH? OH, YEAH. FUNNY, J.T.

11
00:00:47,488 --> 00:00:48,489
WHAT'S GOING ON?

12
00:00:48,522 --> 00:00:51,692
NOTHING. JUST WRITING SOME E-MAILS.

13
00:00:51,725 --> 00:00:54,695
UM, I WANTED TO ASK YOU....

14
00:00:54,728 --> 00:00:57,331
I SAW YOU AND ARMSTRONG THIS MORNING.

15
00:00:57,364 --> 00:01:00,267
AND? WHAT'S YOUR POINT?

16
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:02,236
IT LOOKED LIKE -

17
00:01:03,203 --> 00:01:06,340
LOOKED LIKE WHAT? I HAD A FEW QUESTIONS.

18
00:01:06,373 --> 00:01:08,242
ABOUT EQUATIONS. SO?

19
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:12,479
ARE YOU TRYING TO READ MY E-MAILS?

20
00:01:12,513 --> 00:01:13,714
NO. NOT AT ALL.

21
00:01:13,747 --> 00:01:18,285
E-MAILS ARE PRIVATE. MIND YOUR OWN BUSINESS.

22
00:01:25,426 --> 00:01:27,428
♪ WHAT EVER IT TAKES

23
00:01:29,363 --> 00:01:32,199
♪ I KNOW I CAN MAKE IT THROUGH

24
00:01:34,435 --> 00:01:36,236
♪ IF I HOLD OUT

25
00:01:38,338 --> 00:01:41,175
♪ I KNOW I CAN MAKE IT THROUGH

26
00:01:43,877 --> 00:01:45,579
♪ BE THE BEST

27
00:01:45,612 --> 00:01:47,548
♪ THE BEST I CAN BE

28
00:01:49,283 --> 00:01:51,418
♪ HEAR WHAT I SAY TO YOU

29
00:01:52,419 --> 00:01:54,421
♪ WHAT EVER IT TAKES

30
00:01:56,223 --> 00:01:58,392
♪ I KNOW I CAN MAKE IT

31
00:02:00,828 --> 00:02:03,764
♪ I KNOW I CAN MAKE IT THROUGH

32
00:02:18,545 --> 00:02:20,314
DON'T YOU THINK YOU'RE BEING A BIT OBVIOUS?

33
00:02:20,347 --> 00:02:21,715
ABOUT WHAT?

34
00:02:21,748 --> 00:02:27,254
SEAN. IF YOU STARE ANY HARDER YOUR EYEBALLS WILL POP OUT.

35
00:02:27,287 --> 00:02:29,556
J.T.? WHAT DO YOU THINK OF ARMSTRONG?

36
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:31,391
I MEAN AS A PERSON.

37
00:02:31,725 --> 00:02:35,896
TEACHERS AREN'T PEOPLE. THEY'RE-- TEACHERS.

38
00:02:36,563 --> 00:02:40,934
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN. DO YOU THINK HE'S-- OKAY?

39
00:02:40,968 --> 00:02:44,872
OH YEAH. ARMSTRONG'S GIVEN ME LOTS OF EXTRA HELP.

40
00:02:44,905 --> 00:02:47,908
HE'S BEEN REALLY NICE. TO ME, ANYWAY.

41
00:02:47,941 --> 00:02:52,679
YEAH, COME TO THINK OF IT, HE'S NICE TO EVERYONE--

42
00:03:09,396 --> 00:03:10,430
YOU GONNA EAT THAT?

43
00:03:10,464 --> 00:03:12,799
HUH? NO. YOU TAKE IT.

44
00:03:16,403 --> 00:03:18,405
SOMETHING I SAID?

45
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:23,844
HEY, SHEILA. TWO SPECIALS PLEASE.

46
00:03:25,379 --> 00:03:28,315
WHAT IS THAT? NUCLEAR WASTE?

47
00:03:28,348 --> 00:03:30,951
I DON'T WANT TO HEAR ABOUT IT, GAVIN.

48
00:03:30,984 --> 00:03:33,820
HEY GUYS. DID YA SEE THE SIGN IN THE BATHROOM?

49
00:03:33,854 --> 00:03:36,623
'FLUSH TWICE - IT'S A LONG WAY TO THE CAFETERIA.'

50
00:03:36,657 --> 00:03:39,426
GAVIN? IT MIGHT TAKE YOU A FEW EXTRA YEARS,

51
00:03:39,459 --> 00:03:42,963
BUT I CAN'T WAIT FOR THE DAY YOU GRADUATE.

52
00:03:59,313 --> 00:04:00,747
AW MAN!

53
00:04:00,781 --> 00:04:03,350
EW, WHAT IS IT? EW! EW!

54
00:04:03,383 --> 00:04:06,453
SHEILA, THERE'S A BUG IN MY SQUASH.

55
00:04:06,486 --> 00:04:10,290
I THINK THE JOKE GOES, 'WAITER, THERE'S A FLY IN MY SOUP.'

56
00:04:10,324 --> 00:04:13,460
I'M SERIOUS. IT'S RIGHT OVER--

57
00:04:14,928 --> 00:04:17,464
NICE TRY, GAVIN. BY THE WAY, DON'T FORGET TO PAY FOR THAT.

58
00:04:17,497 --> 00:04:20,567
IT'S FOUR NINETY-NINE PLUS TAX. NEXT!

59
00:04:26,073 --> 00:04:29,710
SO, EM, FOR MEDIA IMMERSION. SHOULD WE USE HTML?

60
00:04:29,743 --> 00:04:32,279
YEAH. SURE. WHATEVER.

61
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:36,450
MANNY? HAS ARMSTRONG EVER TOUCHED YOU?

62
00:04:38,452 --> 00:04:41,588
WHAT? NO! DID HE TOUCH YOU?

63
00:04:41,922 --> 00:04:46,860
NO, NO. NOT ME. LIBERTY. I SAW HIM TOUCHING LIBERTY.

64
00:04:47,861 --> 00:04:49,596
ARE YOU SURE?

65
00:04:52,132 --> 00:04:54,768
YEAH. I KNOW WHAT I SAW.

66
00:04:54,801 --> 00:04:59,973
I DON'T KNOW, EM. ARMSTRONG'S A PRETTY PHYSICAL GUY.

67
00:05:00,007 --> 00:05:02,442
MAYBE YOU GOT THE WRONG IDEA?

68
00:05:02,476 --> 00:05:03,477
I HOPE SO.

69
00:05:05,479 --> 00:05:08,081
BUT THIS MORNING? HE HAD HIS ARM AROUND LIBERTY.

70
00:05:08,115 --> 00:05:11,485
THEN I SAW HIM PASS HER A NOTE OUTSIDE.

71
00:05:11,518 --> 00:05:13,487
IT REALLY LOOKED LIKE HE WAS COMING ON TO HER.

72
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:17,124
MR. ARMSTRONG? YOU'VE GOT TO BE MAKING THIS UP.

73
00:05:17,157 --> 00:05:18,358
NO. I SWEAR.

74
00:05:18,392 --> 00:05:20,394
IT JUST SO HAPPENS THAT YOU'RE ALWAYS COMPLAINING

75
00:05:20,427 --> 00:05:23,363
ABOUT THE FOOD AND NOW YOU FIND A BUG. HMM.

76
00:05:23,397 --> 00:05:27,601
PAIGE, C'MON. DOES THIS LOOK LIKE THE FACE OF A LIAR?

77
00:05:27,634 --> 00:05:29,536
YOU WANT AN HONEST ANSWER?

78
00:05:29,569 --> 00:05:32,472
WHY WON'T ANYONE BELIEVE ME? TELL HER, JIMMY.

79
00:05:32,506 --> 00:05:35,742
THERE WAS SOME KIND OF WEIRDNESS ON HIS PLATE.

80
00:05:35,776 --> 00:05:37,411
YOU SURE IT WASN'T JUST A HAIR?

81
00:05:37,444 --> 00:05:38,779
A MOTH, I THINK.

82
00:05:38,812 --> 00:05:41,381
AN EARWIG, DUDE. AN EARWIG.

83
00:05:41,415 --> 00:05:45,719
SEE? YOU TWO CAN'T EVEN GET YOUR STORIES STRAIGHT.

84
00:05:45,752 --> 00:05:47,454
BOYCOTT THE CAF!

85
00:05:47,487 --> 00:05:50,524
HEY GUYS, THE CAF HAS BUGS! BOYCOTT THE CAF!

86
00:05:50,557 --> 00:05:53,493
THAT'S A SERIOUS ACCUSATION.

87
00:05:53,527 --> 00:05:57,698
MS. KWAN. I FOUND A BUG IN MY FOOD. AN EARWIG.

88
00:05:57,731 --> 00:05:59,866
AND WHERE IS THIS OFFENSIVE CREATURE NOW?

89
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:01,735
STUCK TO A KID'S SHOE.

90
00:06:01,768 --> 00:06:05,639
GAVIN. DEFAMATION AND RUMOUR MONGERING ARE SERIOUS OFFENCES.

91
00:06:05,672 --> 00:06:07,474
THE NEXT TIME YOU HAVE AN ACCUSATION LIKE THAT

92
00:06:07,507 --> 00:06:09,543
YOU BETTER HAVE PROOF.

93
00:06:23,623 --> 00:06:26,493
WHAT'S WITH YOU? YOU LOOK AWFUL.

94
00:06:26,526 --> 00:06:28,161
THANKS, PAIGE.

95
00:06:28,195 --> 00:06:30,597
NO, I MEAN, WHAT'S GOING ON?

96
00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:32,165
IT'S GOOD TO GET THINGS OFF YOUR CHEST.

97
00:06:32,199 --> 00:06:33,834
YOU'LL FEEL WAY BETTER.

98
00:06:33,867 --> 00:06:35,802
I GUESS SO. BUT --

99
00:06:35,836 --> 00:06:41,575
TERRI. WE'RE FRIENDS, RIGHT? FRIENDS TALK TO EACH OTHER.

100
00:06:41,608 --> 00:06:45,011
OKAY, BUT YOU HAVE TO PROMISE TO KEEP IT SECRET.

101
00:06:45,045 --> 00:06:46,446
I REALLY MEAN IT.

102
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:48,782
OF COURSE. WHAT IS IT?

103
00:06:49,649 --> 00:06:51,651
YOU KNOW LIBERTY? THAT KID IN SEVENTH GRADE?

104
00:06:51,685 --> 00:06:55,689
WELL, I HEARD ARMSTRONG... WAS COMING ON TO HER.

105
00:06:59,593 --> 00:07:01,728
EW. YOU'RE KIDDING, RIGHT?

106
00:07:01,762 --> 00:07:06,466
NO, I OVERHEARD EMMA. SHE SAW HIM WITH HIS ARM AROUND HER.

107
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:08,568
THEN, ON THE STEPS, HE GAVE HER A LOVE NOTE.

108
00:07:08,602 --> 00:07:10,670
SO WHAT DO WE DO? REPORT IT?

109
00:07:10,704 --> 00:07:17,711
HON, YOU CAN'T REPORT A RUMOUR.

110
00:07:21,181 --> 00:07:23,850
AFTERNOON, EVERYONE.

111
00:07:27,087 --> 00:07:28,555
SOMETHING WRONG, GIRLS?

112
00:07:28,588 --> 00:07:31,858
OH, NO. NOTHING, MR. ARMSTRONG.

113
00:07:34,661 --> 00:07:36,630
OKAY.

114
00:07:36,663 --> 00:07:41,201
TODAY WE'RE GONNA TAKE A LOOK AT DISTRIBUTIVE PROPERTIES.

115
00:07:42,035 --> 00:07:45,605
ALRIGHT, IN REVIEW YOU'LL REMEMBER THE THREE MAIN RULES,

116
00:07:45,639 --> 00:07:47,707
THE OPERATIONS IN BRACKETS...

117
00:08:02,255 --> 00:08:06,760
GET THIS. LIBERTY AND ARMSTRONG WERE SEEN KISSING OUTSIDE.

118
00:08:06,793 --> 00:08:11,631
YEAH. THEY WERE IN HIS CAR, KISSING IN FRONT OF EVERYBODY.

119
00:08:12,766 --> 00:08:15,135
SHE GOT A RIDE IN WITH HIM THIS MORNING.

120
00:08:15,168 --> 00:08:16,770
DO YOU THINK THEY SPENT THE NIGHT TOGETHER?

121
00:08:16,803 --> 00:08:19,639
HOW COULD COACH ARMSTRONG DO THAT?

122
00:08:22,709 --> 00:08:25,579
DUDE. LIBERTY AND ARMSTRONG ARE DOING IT!

123
00:08:59,179 --> 00:09:00,780
NEXT ON THE AGENDA?

124
00:09:00,814 --> 00:09:03,717
THE MOTION THAT LIBERTY PUT FORWARD LAST MEETING.

125
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:05,685
RIGHT. ABOUT THE TALENT SHOW.

126
00:09:05,719 --> 00:09:08,121
SO WHAT DO YOU THINK, ASHLEY? SHOULD WE HAVE ONE?

127
00:09:08,154 --> 00:09:10,690
SURE. SOUNDS GREAT.

128
00:09:12,859 --> 00:09:18,798
WOW. THAT WAS EASY. WE ARGUED ABOUT IT FOR HOURS LAST WEEK.

129
00:09:19,165 --> 00:09:20,834
GUYS? YOU CAN STOP WHISPERING.

130
00:09:20,867 --> 00:09:22,969
I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

131
00:09:23,003 --> 00:09:24,337
YOU DO?

132
00:09:24,838 --> 00:09:26,740
OF COURSE. EVERYBODY KNOWS WHAT HAPPENED.

133
00:09:26,773 --> 00:09:28,942
SO WE MIGHT AS WELL DISCUSS IT.

134
00:09:28,975 --> 00:09:33,380
UM, OKAY. BUT DON'T YOU WANT TO DISCUSS IT IN PRIVATE?

135
00:09:33,413 --> 00:09:36,616
IT'S NO SECRET, ASHLEY. WE ALL KNOW SOME MICROPHONES

136
00:09:36,650 --> 00:09:38,752
WERE STOLEN AT LAST YEAR'S SHOW.

137
00:09:38,785 --> 00:09:42,188
BUT IT WON'T HAPPEN THIS YEAR, I PROMISE.

138
00:09:46,927 --> 00:09:48,328
LIBERTY?

139
00:09:49,296 --> 00:09:50,363
IF IT'S ABOUT THE MICROPHONES--

140
00:09:50,397 --> 00:09:54,868
IT'S NOT. DO YOU EVEN KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON?

141
00:09:55,769 --> 00:09:59,105
PEOPLE ARE TALKING. ABOUT YOU AND ARMSTRONG.

142
00:09:59,139 --> 00:10:01,741
THAT YOU'RE PRETTY CLOSE.

143
00:10:01,775 --> 00:10:04,210
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

144
00:10:04,244 --> 00:10:09,849
IT MEANS PEOPLE THINK YOU TWO ARE, UH... EXTRA-FRIENDLY.

145
00:10:11,785 --> 00:10:14,955
THEY- THEY THINK HE'S DOING THINGS TO ME?

146
00:10:14,988 --> 00:10:16,823
YES. IS IT TRUE?

147
00:10:16,856 --> 00:10:18,058
OF COURSE NOT!

148
00:10:18,091 --> 00:10:22,729
IF IT IS, WE HAVE TO REPORT IT. LIBERTY, PLEASE!

149
00:10:22,762 --> 00:10:24,397
JUST WAIT WE CAN TALK!

150
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,983
I KNEW SOMETHING WAS GOING ON.

151
00:10:43,016 --> 00:10:44,384
YOU DID?

152
00:10:44,417 --> 00:10:48,021
WE TALKED ABOUT IT YESTERDAY. I JUST COULDN'T BELIEVE IT.

153
00:10:48,054 --> 00:10:51,091
I STILL CAN'T. MAYBE WE SHOULD REPORT IT?

154
00:10:51,124 --> 00:10:52,892
ARMSTRONG WOULD BE TOAST.

155
00:10:52,926 --> 00:10:55,962
THAT'S TRUE. WE SHOULD WAIT AND FIND OUT FOR SURE.

156
00:10:55,996 --> 00:10:58,398
THIS WHOLE THING? IT'S DISGUSTING.

157
00:10:58,431 --> 00:11:02,035
JUST THE THOUGHT OF IT -- YECH. MAKES ME WANT TO TAKE A SHOWER.

158
00:11:02,068 --> 00:11:04,437
THAT WOULDN'T BE SUCH A BAD IDEA.

159
00:11:04,471 --> 00:11:07,073
SO, WHAT DO WE DO NOW?

160
00:11:27,527 --> 00:11:29,462
LEAVE ME ALONE, EMMA.

161
00:11:30,263 --> 00:11:32,265
LIBERTY, WHAT YOU NEED RIGHT NOW IS A FRIEND.

162
00:11:32,298 --> 00:11:33,867
SOMEONE TO TALK TO.

163
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:36,002
BUT THERE'S NOTHING TO TALK ABOUT!

164
00:11:36,036 --> 00:11:37,170
IT'S OKAY. YOU CAN TELL ME.

165
00:11:37,203 --> 00:11:39,939
I AM TELLING YOU.

166
00:11:39,973 --> 00:11:41,241
ARE YOU SURE YOU'RE NOT LYING?

167
00:11:41,274 --> 00:11:43,009
BECAUSE WE REALLY HAVE TO REPORT IT --

168
00:11:43,043 --> 00:11:47,814
EMMA! I SWEAR ON MY LIFE THAT NOTHING'S GOING ON.

169
00:11:47,847 --> 00:11:49,049
THE WHOLE SCHOOL IS TALKING.

170
00:11:49,082 --> 00:11:53,019
I KNOW! BUT IT'S JUST A VICIOUS RUMOUR. HONEST.

171
00:11:53,053 --> 00:11:56,756
WHAT IF IT GETS TO RADITCH? TO MY PARENTS?

172
00:11:57,123 --> 00:12:01,061
WHAT'LL MR. ARMSTRONG SAY WHEN HE HEARS THIS?

173
00:12:04,097 --> 00:12:06,099
THEN THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY TO HANDLE THIS.

174
00:12:06,132 --> 00:12:08,501
STOP THE RUMOUR AND TRACK DOWN IT'S SOURCE.

175
00:12:08,535 --> 00:12:10,103
THEN GIVE WHOEVER STARTED IT A --

176
00:12:10,136 --> 00:12:12,272
-- GOOD SWIFT KICK?

177
00:12:12,305 --> 00:12:17,477
I WAS GOING TO SAY 'A GOOD TALKING TO'. BUT THAT'LL DO.

178
00:12:24,484 --> 00:12:27,120
HEY SPINNER, FIND ANY BUGS IN YOUR BREAKFAST THIS MORNING?

179
00:12:27,153 --> 00:12:30,457
VERY FUNNY. SO I MADE A MISTAKE.

180
00:12:32,025 --> 00:12:33,827
WHY'D YOU SAY YOU MADE A MISTAKE?

181
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:35,395
BECAUSE I DID.

182
00:12:35,428 --> 00:12:36,496
WHAT?

183
00:12:37,697 --> 00:12:39,399
I'M ALWAYS COMPLAINING ABOUT THE FOOD, RIGHT?

184
00:12:39,432 --> 00:12:41,801
SO I MUST'VE MADE IT UP.

185
00:12:41,835 --> 00:12:44,270
OKAY, NOW I'M COMPLETELY CONFUSED.

186
00:12:44,304 --> 00:12:46,072
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN TOTALLY DIFFERENT IF SOMEONE ELSE

187
00:12:46,106 --> 00:12:48,875
FOUND THAT BUG. THEN EVERYONE WOULD BELIEVE IT.

188
00:12:48,908 --> 00:12:50,376
EVEN THE WRATH OF KWAN.

189
00:12:50,410 --> 00:12:52,011
I GUESS SO.

190
00:13:01,488 --> 00:13:04,224
BETTER NOT BE TUNA SALAD IN HERE.

191
00:13:05,992 --> 00:13:06,259
AW!

192
00:13:08,094 --> 00:13:10,597
TODAY'S SPECIAL? EARWIG SURPRISE.

193
00:13:10,630 --> 00:13:13,333
TOOK ME HOURS TO COLLECT THEM.

194
00:13:14,467 --> 00:13:18,538
WHEN I GET DONE? CAF WILL BE CLOSED. PERMANENTLY.

195
00:13:23,443 --> 00:13:24,878
ARE YOU SURE IT ISN'T TRUE, THOUGH?

196
00:13:24,911 --> 00:13:26,479
WHEN I TALKED TO LIBERTY YESTERDAY,

197
00:13:26,513 --> 00:13:29,482
SHE WAS REALLY DEFENSIVE. LIKE SHE WAS HIDING SOMETHING.

198
00:13:29,516 --> 00:13:34,120
SHE WAS PROBABLY JUST UPSET. WOULDN'T YOU BE?

199
00:13:34,154 --> 00:13:36,856
YEAH, I WOULD. POOR GIRL.

200
00:13:36,890 --> 00:13:38,358
WHO WOULD SPREAD A RUMOUR LIKE THAT?

201
00:13:38,391 --> 00:13:40,160
THAT'S WHAT I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT.

202
00:13:40,193 --> 00:13:43,363
WHO DID YOU HEAR IT FROM, ASHLEY?

203
00:13:43,396 --> 00:13:47,567
IT WAS JIMMY. BUT HE HEARD IT FROM SPINNER!

204
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:51,204
HEY, IT WASN'T ME WHO STARTED IT. TALK TO THIS GUY --

205
00:13:51,237 --> 00:13:52,172
SEAN!?

206
00:13:52,205 --> 00:13:53,039
WHAT!?

207
00:13:53,072 --> 00:13:54,040
HE'S THE ONE WHO TOLD ME.

208
00:13:54,073 --> 00:13:56,176
ABOUT COACH ARMSTRONG AND LIBERTY?

209
00:13:56,209 --> 00:13:58,077
MAN, IT'S JUST SICK.

210
00:13:58,111 --> 00:14:00,480
IT'S NOT TRUE, SEAN.

211
00:14:00,513 --> 00:14:01,447
IT ISN'T?

212
00:14:01,481 --> 00:14:02,515
NO.

213
00:14:03,983 --> 00:14:06,286
MAN, I KNEW IT SOUNDED FAKE.

214
00:14:06,319 --> 00:14:08,621
I SHOULD HAVE NEVER BELIEVED HER.

215
00:14:08,655 --> 00:14:10,523
BELIEVED WHO?

216
00:14:11,057 --> 00:14:14,060
I'M INNOCENT. TALK TO PAIGE.

217
00:14:17,096 --> 00:14:18,464
I WAS MERELY IMPARTING INFORMATION.

218
00:14:18,498 --> 00:14:21,201
AND BESIDES, I HEARD IT FROM TERRI.

219
00:14:21,234 --> 00:14:24,170
SHE'S THE ONE YOU NEED TO SPEAK TO.

220
00:14:30,577 --> 00:14:32,579
I NEED TO TALK TO YOU.

221
00:14:32,612 --> 00:14:33,947
O-KAY.

222
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:36,349
THE WHOLE SCHOOL'S GOSSIPING ABOUT LIBERTY AND ARMSTRONG.

223
00:14:36,382 --> 00:14:38,184
NO KIDDING. I HAVE EARS TOO.

224
00:14:38,218 --> 00:14:39,686
WELL, IT'S NOT TRUE. IT'S JUST A RUMOUR.

225
00:14:39,719 --> 00:14:42,555
PAIGE SPREAD IT AROUND. BUT SHE HEARD IT FROM YOU.

226
00:14:42,589 --> 00:14:44,290
I SWORE HER TO SECRECY!

227
00:14:44,324 --> 00:14:47,327
AS IF SHE'D KEEP QUIET. PAIGE LIVES FOR RUMOURS.

228
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:51,231
I WAS UPSET, OKAY? I WAS SHOCKED. I HAD TO TELL SOMEONE.

229
00:14:51,264 --> 00:14:52,265
I'M SORRY.

230
00:14:52,298 --> 00:14:54,400
WELL, TOO LATE. I HOPE YOU'RE HAPPY.

231
00:14:54,434 --> 00:14:55,602
ME!?

232
00:14:55,635 --> 00:14:57,604
HELLO? YOU'RE THE ONE WHO STARTED THE RUMOUR.

233
00:14:57,637 --> 00:14:59,272
HATE TO TELL YOU, BUT -- NO.

234
00:14:59,305 --> 00:15:02,075
IT WAS RIGHT HERE. YESTERDAY. YOU WERE TALKING TO MANNY.

235
00:15:02,108 --> 00:15:04,244
ABOUT LIBERTY AND ARMSTRONG. REMEMBER?

236
00:15:04,277 --> 00:15:06,679
YOU STARTED THE RUMOUR, EMMA.

237
00:15:10,416 --> 00:15:13,653
SPIN, YOU SURE YOU WANT TO DO THIS?

238
00:15:13,686 --> 00:15:15,088
DON'T YOU THINK IT'S A BIT DRASTIC?

239
00:15:15,121 --> 00:15:20,994
NOPE. ALL IS FAIR IN LOVE AND WAR. AND DUDE? THIS IS WAR.

240
00:15:25,164 --> 00:15:29,002
YOU'RE EATING THE CAFETERIA FOOD AGAIN?

241
00:15:29,035 --> 00:15:32,238
I DECIDED TO BE, YOU KNOW, MATURE.

242
00:15:32,272 --> 00:15:34,641
I PROBABLY NEVER EVEN SAW THAT BUG.

243
00:15:34,674 --> 00:15:37,510
GOOD FOR YOU, SPINNER.

244
00:15:37,543 --> 00:15:41,247
JIMMY, CAN YOU PASS ME THE PEPPER, PLEASE?

245
00:15:49,622 --> 00:15:51,557
WHAT'RE YOU SMILING AT?

246
00:15:55,662 --> 00:15:56,729
AHHHHHHHHH!!!

247
00:15:57,630 --> 00:15:59,632
YOU PUT BUGS ON HER TRAY!?

248
00:15:59,666 --> 00:16:02,135
NOBODY BELIEVES ME. BUT THEY'LL BELIEVE HER.

249
00:16:02,168 --> 00:16:03,536
SPINNER! YOU IDIOT!

250
00:16:03,569 --> 00:16:08,207
ASH, CALM DOWN. I TOLD YOU. THERE'S BUGS IN THE FOOD.

251
00:16:08,241 --> 00:16:11,077
BECAUSE YOU PUT THEM THERE!

252
00:16:11,110 --> 00:16:13,579
WHAT'S IN THAT CONTAINER?

253
00:16:13,613 --> 00:16:15,114
NOTHING.

254
00:16:18,451 --> 00:16:19,519
UGH!

255
00:16:23,589 --> 00:16:26,592
GAVIN. WHAT IS GOING ON HERE?

256
00:16:33,132 --> 00:16:37,637
MATH CLASS. I'VE BEEN DREADING THIS ALL DAY.

257
00:16:48,147 --> 00:16:50,783
SO, DID YOU TRACK DOWN THE RUMOUR?

258
00:16:51,718 --> 00:16:56,422
YEAH, BUT I NEED TO SAY SOMETHING TO YOU FIRST.

259
00:16:58,324 --> 00:17:00,727
OKAY, TODAY WE'RE GOING TO BE WORKING ON EQUATIONS.

260
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:04,664
NOW WHEN DEALING WITH EQUATIONS WE ALWAYS USE THE BEDMAS RULE.

261
00:17:04,697 --> 00:17:08,301
NOW WHO CAN TELL ME WHAT THAT STANDS FOR?

262
00:17:11,604 --> 00:17:13,673
WHAT'S WITH EVERYONE TODAY?

263
00:17:18,845 --> 00:17:20,680
OKAY, UH, WHY DON'T YOU TELL US, LIBERTY?

264
00:17:20,713 --> 00:17:23,549
YOU AND I HAVE BEEN WORKING ON IT.

265
00:17:32,692 --> 00:17:34,093
WHAT IS SO FUNNY?

266
00:17:36,295 --> 00:17:38,297
THAT'S ENOUGH!

267
00:17:39,399 --> 00:17:41,334
MR. ARMSTRONG, CAN I HAVE FIVE MINUTES OF YOUR TIME?

268
00:17:41,367 --> 00:17:43,636
I WAS JUST ABOUT TO GET STARTED HERE.

269
00:17:43,669 --> 00:17:47,507
MRS. SMITH WILL TAKE OVER THE CLASS.

270
00:17:49,308 --> 00:17:51,611
RIGHT... UH, OKAY.

271
00:17:51,644 --> 00:17:53,713
CLASS, I WANT YOU TO BEGIN WORKING ON THE UH,

272
00:17:53,746 --> 00:17:57,250
ORDER OF OPERATIONS EXERCISES ON PAGE 129.

273
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:04,624
LIBERTY? WILL YOU JOIN US PLEASE.

274
00:18:31,584 --> 00:18:34,787
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

275
00:18:34,821 --> 00:18:36,722
EMMA. GO BACK TO CLASS.

276
00:18:36,756 --> 00:18:39,592
I NEED TO TALK TO YOU, MR. RADITCH.

277
00:18:39,625 --> 00:18:40,526
WELL IT'LL HAVE TO WAIT.

278
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:41,928
I'M IN THE MIDDLE OF SOMETHING RIGHT NOW.

279
00:18:41,961 --> 00:18:44,831
IT CAN'T WAIT. YOU SEE...

280
00:18:45,565 --> 00:18:47,767
I'M IN THE MIDDLE OF IT, TOO.

281
00:18:56,275 --> 00:18:57,310
YOU'LL HELP ME SERVE AT EVERY LUNCH.

282
00:18:57,343 --> 00:19:01,681
AND THEN AFTER SCHOOL YOU CAN HELP ME CLEAN UP.

283
00:19:01,714 --> 00:19:05,218
OH, AND UH, DON'T FORGET ABOUT THIS.

284
00:19:05,251 --> 00:19:07,653
I'M NOT WEARING THAT.

285
00:19:08,454 --> 00:19:10,389
HEALTH REGULATIONS, PRINCESS.

286
00:19:10,423 --> 00:19:13,493
YOU DO KNOW ABOUT HEALTH REGULATIONS.

287
00:19:21,834 --> 00:19:25,204
HEY, SPIN. HOW LONG ARE YOU --

288
00:19:29,575 --> 00:19:31,844
NICE NET, SPINNER.

289
00:19:36,816 --> 00:19:41,587
CHEER UP. IT WON'T BE FOR LONG. ONLY FOR ABOUT TWO MONTHS.

290
00:19:41,621 --> 00:19:42,622
TWO MONTHS!

291
00:19:42,655 --> 00:19:44,490
YOU OWE THE SCHOOL THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS.

292
00:19:44,524 --> 00:19:47,460
THAT'S WHAT IT'LL COST TO EXTERMINATE THE CAFETERIA.

293
00:19:47,493 --> 00:19:50,930
BUT THE CAF NEEDED TO BE EXTERMINATED ANYWAY!

294
00:19:50,963 --> 00:19:54,567
SURE IT DID, GAVIN. SURE IT DID.

295
00:19:59,472 --> 00:20:00,540
LIBERTY?

296
00:20:04,544 --> 00:20:06,579
I KNOW YOU'RE IN HERE.

297
00:20:08,514 --> 00:20:10,716
I WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE RUMOUR STARTING.

298
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:12,685
BUT I DIDN'T SPREAD IT.

299
00:20:16,322 --> 00:20:18,624
AND THERE'S A DIFFERENCE?

300
00:20:18,658 --> 00:20:21,494
YOU'RE LUCKY MR. ARMSTRONG DIDN'T LOSE HIS JOB.

301
00:20:21,527 --> 00:20:23,763
AND YOU KNOW WHAT MAKES ME REALLY MAD?

302
00:20:23,796 --> 00:20:25,631
THAT YOU THOUGHT I COULD DO THAT.

303
00:20:25,665 --> 00:20:27,800
DO WHAT? BE VIOLATED?

304
00:20:29,035 --> 00:20:31,904
AND WHAT WERE YOU DOING WITH MR. ARMSTRONG ANYWAY?

305
00:20:31,938 --> 00:20:35,775
HE HAD HIS ARM AROUND YOU. PASSED YOU A NOTE -

306
00:20:37,376 --> 00:20:40,379
YOU WANT TO SEE MY 'NOTE'?

307
00:20:42,615 --> 00:20:44,417
DYSCALCULIA?

308
00:20:44,817 --> 00:20:49,555
IT'S A LEARNING DISORDER. LIKE DYSLEXIA BUT WITH NUMBERS.

309
00:20:49,589 --> 00:20:51,390
I'VE BEEN REALLY UPSET ABOUT IT.

310
00:20:51,424 --> 00:20:53,993
MR. ARMSTRONG'S BEEN HELPING ME.

311
00:20:54,026 --> 00:20:59,498
SO THAT'S THE EXPLANATION? WHY DIDN'T YOU SAY SOMETHING?

312
00:21:01,701 --> 00:21:03,502
BECAUSE IT MEANS YOU'RE NOT PERFECT?

313
00:21:03,536 --> 00:21:05,037
BECAUSE IT MEANS I'M STUPID!

314
00:21:05,071 --> 00:21:08,307
STUPID? YOU'RE ONE OF THE SMARTEST KIDS IN SCHOOL.

315
00:21:08,341 --> 00:21:09,575
NOT IN MATH, I'M NOT.

316
00:21:09,609 --> 00:21:11,010
WHO CARES?

317
00:21:11,043 --> 00:21:14,347
I DO! IT'S IMPORTANT TO ME TO BE THE BEST.

318
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:15,915
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND!

319
00:21:18,784 --> 00:21:21,053
LIBERTY, I FEEL REALLY BAD.

320
00:21:21,087 --> 00:21:23,956
IS THERE'S SOMETHING I CAN DO? TO HELP?

321
00:21:23,990 --> 00:21:27,727
NO, EMMA. GO BACK TO SAVING RAINFORESTS. AND WHALES.

322
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:32,031
'CAUSE WHEN IT COMES TO HELPING PEOPLE - YOU SUCK.
