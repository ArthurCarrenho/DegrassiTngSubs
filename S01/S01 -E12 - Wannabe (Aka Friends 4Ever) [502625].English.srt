1
00:00:04,345 --> 00:00:05,245
Sorry I'm late.

2
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:06,814
No problem, the interview isn't over yet.

3
00:00:06,847 --> 00:00:08,515
Hazel, you were saying?

4
00:00:08,549 --> 00:00:10,284
Well, we are a school sanctioned club -

5
00:00:10,317 --> 00:00:12,386
so now it's just a question of getting enough people

6
00:00:12,419 --> 00:00:15,656
to sign up. But they will. Of course.

7
00:00:15,689 --> 00:00:18,492
Okay. What would you say to a student who thinks-

8
00:00:18,525 --> 00:00:20,194
cheerleading is sexist?

9
00:00:20,227 --> 00:00:22,529
I'd say - get over it. Welcome to the new millennium.

10
00:00:22,563 --> 00:00:25,733
Totally. I mean, cheerleading is such a positive thing.

11
00:00:25,766 --> 00:00:27,468
It's great exercise--

12
00:00:27,501 --> 00:00:29,136
it builds leadership skills.

13
00:00:29,169 --> 00:00:30,671
It's better than watching TV.

14
00:00:30,704 --> 00:00:34,174
And it boosts school spirit. I mean, what's bad about that?

15
00:00:34,274 --> 00:00:36,643
Thank you. and good luck.

16
00:00:41,315 --> 00:00:42,783
Can I help you?

17
00:00:42,816 --> 00:00:45,152
I'm Manny. I'd like to try out?

18
00:00:45,319 --> 00:00:48,155
Okay. what can you do?

19
00:00:57,631 --> 00:01:01,168
Manny, sweetie. sign right here.

School spirit. can you have enough?

31
00:01:50,284 --> 00:01:52,186
If you ask me the answer is no!

32
00:01:52,219 --> 00:01:54,755
That's why I've formed the degrassi spirit squad.

33
00:01:54,788 --> 00:01:57,691
So come sign up. girls and boys.

34
00:01:57,791 --> 00:02:02,262
Gimme a D! Gimme an E! Gimme a G! Gimme an I!

35
00:02:02,296 --> 00:02:05,432
Gimme a break. cheerleaders? Please.

36
00:02:05,466 --> 00:02:09,903
What does that spell? De---grassi! Whooooo!

37
00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:11,572
It's like we're traveling back in time.

38
00:02:11,605 --> 00:02:13,340
Cheerleading is so over.

39
00:02:13,373 --> 00:02:16,543
What? Cheerleading is huge. More popular than ever.

40
00:02:16,577 --> 00:02:19,213
So are a lot of things that're just sexist and wrong.

41
00:02:19,246 --> 00:02:21,448
How can it be sexist if there are guys?

42
00:02:21,482 --> 00:02:23,750
I bet the guys won't be wearing tight sweaters and mini-skirts.

43
00:02:23,784 --> 00:02:25,552
I hope not.

44
00:02:25,586 --> 00:02:28,388
Anyway, I was just think cheerleading might be... fun.

45
00:02:28,422 --> 00:02:32,793
Fun? Manny, you're not thinking of...

46
00:02:33,694 --> 00:02:36,797
You really wanna become some pom-pom pumping robot?

47
00:02:36,830 --> 00:02:37,898
I'm surprised.

48
00:02:37,931 --> 00:02:39,032
Em - to tell you the truth?

49
00:02:39,066 --> 00:02:42,669
I don't think degrassi should have a squad, period.

50
00:02:42,703 --> 00:02:44,638
Okay. Forget it. You're right.

51
00:02:44,671 --> 00:02:47,341
Can we talk about something else?

52
00:02:48,876 --> 00:02:52,246
I can't taste them anymore. I can't taste anything anymore.

53
00:02:52,412 --> 00:02:55,282
That's just the sodium. Keep going. Faster.

54
00:03:04,024 --> 00:03:06,493
What exactly are you two doing?

55
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:08,195
Nothing. -Nothing.

56
00:03:29,816 --> 00:03:30,851
Why don't you trust me?

57
00:03:30,884 --> 00:03:33,654
I don't not trust you. I just want to make sure

58
00:03:33,687 --> 00:03:35,455
you didn't overlook the ace of clubs.

59
00:03:35,489 --> 00:03:37,591
As if I'd overlook that!

60
00:03:37,624 --> 00:03:40,260
You're right. you didn't. No luck.

61
00:03:42,696 --> 00:03:45,599
My twelve o'clock. Liberty van Zandt. With a chip can.

62
00:03:46,867 --> 00:03:47,634
What?

63
00:03:47,668 --> 00:03:49,836
What? We can't come over to say hi?

64
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:51,605
Okay. We want your chip can.

65
00:03:51,638 --> 00:03:53,440
Shut up.

66
00:03:53,473 --> 00:03:56,376
Guys-- what's going on?

67
00:03:56,410 --> 00:03:59,346
It's a contest. Get one can with the ace of spades

68
00:03:59,379 --> 00:04:02,316
and one with the ace of clubs, you win a million bucks.

69
00:04:02,549 --> 00:04:03,650
We already have the ace of spades.

70
00:04:03,684 --> 00:04:05,686
It is in a top-secret hiding place.

71
00:04:05,719 --> 00:04:07,688
Yes, yes very top secret.

72
00:04:07,721 --> 00:04:09,489
But we still need the other half.

73
00:04:09,523 --> 00:04:11,625
And the deadline's in three days.

74
00:04:11,658 --> 00:04:13,694
You've been doing this how long?

75
00:04:13,727 --> 00:04:15,062
Two months.

76
00:04:15,095 --> 00:04:18,465
Some advice. Find a dictionary and look up "pathetic".

77
00:04:19,032 --> 00:04:21,368
Can we just have your can?

78
00:04:25,706 --> 00:04:28,875
"Sorry, try again." Like the rest of them.

79
00:04:30,577 --> 00:04:32,913
Try again?

80
00:04:33,046 --> 00:04:35,515
Liberty, wait. Liberty let's make a deal--

81
00:04:35,549 --> 00:04:37,784
So you're still coming over tonight to study, right?

82
00:04:37,951 --> 00:04:41,388
Manny, there you are! Let's see that awesome cartwheel again.

83
00:04:43,023 --> 00:04:44,124
Come on, Manny.

84
00:04:44,157 --> 00:04:46,827
If you want to be on the spirit squad you can't be shy.

85
00:04:52,966 --> 00:04:54,768
Still amazing!

86
00:04:54,901 --> 00:04:58,605
Yeah, but her landing could've been smoother. if you ask me.

87
00:04:59,406 --> 00:05:02,075
Better watch out, Manny. you're making Hazel jealous.

88
00:05:04,544 --> 00:05:07,547
Please. Paige? Hazel? Are you all gonna, like,

89
00:05:07,581 --> 00:05:10,317
do your colours, like, together, like?

90
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:16,123
Come on, Emma. they're the coolest kids in school.

91
00:05:16,156 --> 00:05:17,991
Mmm-hmm.

92
00:05:18,025 --> 00:05:20,027
And they like me - a grade 7.

93
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:21,862
That's a pretty big deal, you know.

94
00:05:21,895 --> 00:05:24,031
The "big deal" is that no one in this school, except me,

95
00:05:24,064 --> 00:05:26,700
is pointing out the bad side of cheerleading.

96
00:05:26,733 --> 00:05:29,002
Maybe 'cause no one else feels the same way you do.

97
00:05:29,436 --> 00:05:31,872
Most people realize that it's just good fun.

98
00:05:31,905 --> 00:05:32,806
Well maybe if my views-

99
00:05:32,839 --> 00:05:35,142
were brought to the school's attention--

100
00:05:35,175 --> 00:05:38,478
what? Are you saying you're gonna write another article

101
00:05:38,512 --> 00:05:40,614
for the Grapevine?

102
00:05:40,647 --> 00:05:42,115
No, it's not that big a deal.

103
00:05:42,149 --> 00:05:43,283
Great.

104
00:05:43,316 --> 00:05:46,720
Can we talk about something else for a while, please?

105
00:05:52,759 --> 00:05:54,428
You'd have nothing without me.

106
00:05:54,461 --> 00:05:57,030
And you'd have nothing without us!

107
00:05:57,130 --> 00:05:58,965
Fifty-fifty - that's our final offer.

108
00:05:58,999 --> 00:06:01,702
Make that forty-five, forty five.

109
00:06:07,607 --> 00:06:09,142
But that only makes ninety percent.

110
00:06:09,176 --> 00:06:12,713
That's right, Einstein. Plus ten percent for me.

111
00:06:12,746 --> 00:06:13,714
What for?

112
00:06:13,747 --> 00:06:14,881
For protection.

113
00:06:14,915 --> 00:06:17,617
Protection? From who?

114
00:06:17,651 --> 00:06:22,723
The only people who know about this are me, J.T., Liberty --

115
00:06:23,623 --> 00:06:25,892
and you.

116
00:06:28,762 --> 00:06:31,732
Okay. J.T. will bring the ace of spades tomorrow.

117
00:06:31,765 --> 00:06:35,168
I'll hold on to the ace of clubs in the meantime.

118
00:06:35,202 --> 00:06:37,571
For protection.

119
00:06:37,604 --> 00:06:41,875
Then we go cash in. One million smackers.

120
00:06:48,882 --> 00:06:51,718
Hey, girl. Something wrong?

121
00:06:51,752 --> 00:06:54,521
It's Emma. She's taking this whole cheerleading

122
00:06:54,554 --> 00:06:56,957
is sexism thing too far.

123
00:06:56,990 --> 00:07:00,794
Really. How far?

124
00:07:00,827 --> 00:07:04,631
She did say she might write something for the Grapevine.

125
00:07:06,099 --> 00:07:08,468
You know what Manny needs, Hazel?

126
00:07:08,502 --> 00:07:12,606
Some time with the girls. Wanna hang out?

127
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:15,108
Wow. That would be amazing.

128
00:07:15,242 --> 00:07:18,478
My house is like, two minutes from here.

129
00:07:21,047 --> 00:07:22,549
I'd say... an eight.

130
00:07:22,582 --> 00:07:25,018
Hello? We're talking about Joseph here. Try a nine.

131
00:07:25,051 --> 00:07:28,255
Try four. He doesn't wear deodorant.

132
00:07:28,288 --> 00:07:31,591
Major pointage loss on the scent factor.

133
00:07:31,625 --> 00:07:34,494
But I guess we shouldn't be rating boys.

134
00:07:34,528 --> 00:07:37,197
Perfect little Emma would say it's sexist.

135
00:07:37,597 --> 00:07:41,134
Just like cheerleading.

136
00:07:41,168 --> 00:07:44,204
[phone rings]

137
00:07:44,771 --> 00:07:46,840
Guys! It's her.

138
00:07:46,873 --> 00:07:49,743
Make sure she's not writing the article, Manny.

139
00:07:52,145 --> 00:07:53,280
Hello?

140
00:07:53,313 --> 00:07:54,347
Manny? Where are you?

141
00:07:54,381 --> 00:07:56,616
I thought you were coming over tonight to study?

142
00:07:56,650 --> 00:08:00,587
I was, but - I'm not feeling too well.

143
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:02,189
Must be a 24 hour flu.

144
00:08:02,222 --> 00:08:04,224
Oh. Well, hope you feel better.

145
00:08:04,558 --> 00:08:10,831
Thanks. but, um, em? I was just wondering. just to make sure.

146
00:08:10,864 --> 00:08:12,566
You're not really going to write that article

147
00:08:12,599 --> 00:08:14,100
for the Grapevine--

148
00:08:14,134 --> 00:08:16,770
I told you I wasn't. Why?

149
00:08:17,103 --> 00:08:19,706
She's not.

150
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:23,810
I mean, trying to protect the world from cheerleading?

151
00:08:23,844 --> 00:08:24,845
As if.

152
00:08:25,078 --> 00:08:26,613
Did I hear Paige?

153
00:08:26,646 --> 00:08:29,916
She'll be leaving soon and then I'll come by.

154
00:08:30,016 --> 00:08:31,985
Don't bother.

155
00:08:34,621 --> 00:08:37,691
Guys - she heard you.

156
00:09:00,247 --> 00:09:03,116
I - am - toast!

157
00:09:10,624 --> 00:09:14,594
Hey all you panther fans - show your spirit - clap your hands -

158
00:09:14,961 --> 00:09:19,566
D-E-S - Let's hear it! - D-E-S - Let's hear it!

159
00:09:21,167 --> 00:09:24,304
Okay! Let's try this new move. It's called the toe touch.

160
00:09:24,638 --> 00:09:26,306
I'll show you.

161
00:09:30,010 --> 00:09:30,877
Okay?

162
00:09:30,911 --> 00:09:33,346
Not bad. But let's not get crazy here.

163
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:36,016
Besides, I'm sure Manny could do it better.

164
00:09:37,851 --> 00:09:39,786
I don't know about that, girl...

165
00:09:39,819 --> 00:09:42,155
Try.

166
00:09:52,699 --> 00:09:53,633
Manny, sweetie!

167
00:09:53,667 --> 00:09:56,736
You are so going to be the star of the show.

168
00:09:58,004 --> 00:10:02,008
After me, of course.

169
00:10:14,888 --> 00:10:16,089
Emma? Can I help you?

170
00:10:16,122 --> 00:10:17,424
I know this is totally last minute,

171
00:10:17,457 --> 00:10:19,759
but I have an article here for the Grapevine.

172
00:10:19,793 --> 00:10:21,394
Emma, I'm just about to publish--

173
00:10:21,428 --> 00:10:24,731
please, just read it before you say no.

174
00:10:27,067 --> 00:10:30,236
"How can we advance as women if some of us insist

175
00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:34,040
on wearing short skirts and dancing like bimbos..."

176
00:10:34,074 --> 00:10:36,009
Wow. that's harsh.

177
00:10:36,042 --> 00:10:38,011
Really? I didn't think it was strong enough.

178
00:10:38,044 --> 00:10:39,145
I could make it harsher.

179
00:10:39,179 --> 00:10:40,914
No, no, this is good.

180
00:10:40,947 --> 00:10:44,351
You do know that Manny signed up for the spirit squad.

181
00:10:44,384 --> 00:10:46,252
Isn't it weird that you're attacking it?

182
00:10:46,286 --> 00:10:48,154
No! What's weird is Manny.

183
00:10:48,188 --> 00:10:51,891
She's totally becoming this phony person.

184
00:10:54,461 --> 00:10:58,331
Um-- what are those?

185
00:10:58,498 --> 00:11:01,134
Aren't they the most beautiful boots you've ever seen?

186
00:11:01,167 --> 00:11:04,804
They are... they're something.

187
00:11:15,281 --> 00:11:17,684
Manny - that last handstand was flawless!

188
00:11:19,085 --> 00:11:21,921
Oh look, it's little miss save the world.

189
00:11:22,188 --> 00:11:23,890
And it's little miss plastic.

190
00:11:23,923 --> 00:11:26,059
Shouldn't you be out testing your makeup on animals?

191
00:11:26,092 --> 00:11:27,861
Shouldn't you be out hugging trees?

192
00:11:27,894 --> 00:11:29,763
Guys. Come on...

193
00:11:30,130 --> 00:11:33,133
Manny? You were asking about this. it's coming out at noon.

194
00:11:35,835 --> 00:11:39,205
"the spirit squad's only spirit is the spirit of sexism?"

195
00:11:39,973 --> 00:11:42,475
Look what your little friend wrote.

196
00:11:45,345 --> 00:11:48,148
Nice, Emma. so I'm a bimbo too?

197
00:12:02,228 --> 00:12:04,197
I can't believe you wrote that article, em!

198
00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:06,199
You've got to get liberty to cancel it -

199
00:12:06,232 --> 00:12:08,001
how long have we been friends?

200
00:12:08,034 --> 00:12:09,335
Since kindergarten --

201
00:12:09,369 --> 00:12:11,337
And now you think you can drop me like a hot potato

202
00:12:11,371 --> 00:12:13,440
just because, ooh, some eighth grader is finally

203
00:12:13,473 --> 00:12:14,974
talking to you?!

204
00:12:15,008 --> 00:12:16,276
It's not like that, Em.

205
00:12:16,309 --> 00:12:18,845
I want to become a cheerleader, that's all.

206
00:12:18,878 --> 00:12:20,547
Please--

207
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:22,382
Is it so wrong if I become friends with Paige

208
00:12:22,415 --> 00:12:25,018
in the process?

209
00:12:25,351 --> 00:12:27,921
You honestly think Paige is your friend?

210
00:12:27,954 --> 00:12:29,856
Is that so hard to believe?

211
00:12:29,889 --> 00:12:32,058
That for once someone cool likes me?

212
00:12:32,092 --> 00:12:33,893
She's just using you, Manny.

213
00:12:33,927 --> 00:12:35,328
No. you're just jealous--

214
00:12:35,361 --> 00:12:38,131
Jealous of that pretentious wannabe??

215
00:12:38,431 --> 00:12:41,801
You know the difference between you and Paige? Paige is fun.

216
00:12:41,835 --> 00:12:44,304
You're so boring, sometimes I want to scream.

217
00:12:48,374 --> 00:12:51,544
Well - I sure hope you and Paige have fun together.

218
00:12:52,078 --> 00:12:53,213
Just don't come crying to me-

219
00:12:53,246 --> 00:12:55,048
when she stabs a knife in your back.

220
00:12:55,081 --> 00:12:57,083
Don't worry. I won't!

221
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:09,229
Please. I can afford it.

222
00:13:09,262 --> 00:13:12,132
It's yours. really, take it.

223
00:13:13,199 --> 00:13:15,301
What are you doing??

224
00:13:15,969 --> 00:13:19,606
It was cheap. I'm upgrading my whole electronic system.

225
00:13:19,639 --> 00:13:22,342
You - might want to stop doing that for a while.

226
00:13:22,375 --> 00:13:24,511
Why?

227
00:13:26,946 --> 00:13:30,917
You do have the other can don't you?

228
00:13:31,151 --> 00:13:33,052
You lost the ace of spades?!

229
00:13:33,153 --> 00:13:37,090
Shh! I didn't lose it. I just - misplaced it.

230
00:13:37,423 --> 00:13:41,961
What!? How could you misplace our chance at a million bucks??

231
00:13:42,162 --> 00:13:45,031
My mom went on one of her cleaning binges.

232
00:13:45,064 --> 00:13:47,433
I just can't remember where I moved it to.

233
00:13:47,567 --> 00:13:49,502
Well think, man, think!

234
00:13:49,536 --> 00:13:52,138
Shh!

235
00:13:52,305 --> 00:13:56,843
Ah, my two favourite people. Anything wrong?

236
00:13:58,311 --> 00:14:01,014
Okay. our last unit was online portfolios.

237
00:14:01,047 --> 00:14:03,917
Today, I'm going to introduce you to photoshop.

238
00:14:03,950 --> 00:14:05,385
So you can begin to learn how to scan and edit

239
00:14:05,418 --> 00:14:08,388
images digitally. It's amazing what these programs can do.

240
00:14:08,421 --> 00:14:11,491
You can change hair colour, eye colour, whatever you want.

241
00:14:12,192 --> 00:14:13,259
Now, we're going to take it slow at first

242
00:14:13,293 --> 00:14:15,028
because I don't want you guys to get too caught up

243
00:14:15,061 --> 00:14:17,063
with playing around with the technology--

244
00:14:17,096 --> 00:14:20,133
[bell rings]

245
00:14:20,934 --> 00:14:22,368
Students, remember to pick up the new edition

246
00:14:22,402 --> 00:14:25,305
of the Degrassi Grapevine, out now.

247
00:14:25,338 --> 00:14:29,509
And lunch today - mongolian chicken stir-fry.

248
00:14:44,457 --> 00:14:46,459
What are you guys doing?

249
00:14:46,492 --> 00:14:50,163
Just making some editorial changes.

250
00:14:56,369 --> 00:14:58,137
Emma's article is just horrible.

251
00:14:58,171 --> 00:15:00,940
I mean, it's really going to hurt us.

252
00:15:00,974 --> 00:15:03,109
Here, Manny. you do the next one.

253
00:15:04,344 --> 00:15:07,280
Normally I wouldn't put stock in anything a grade 7 wrote.

254
00:15:07,313 --> 00:15:08,414
No offence.

255
00:15:08,448 --> 00:15:10,283
But we need 12 people for the squad.

256
00:15:10,316 --> 00:15:11,985
And we only have eight.

257
00:15:12,018 --> 00:15:14,420
This article might convince people not to join.

258
00:15:14,454 --> 00:15:16,522
And then -- no spirit squad.

259
00:15:17,056 --> 00:15:19,192
I mean, you do want a spirit squad?

260
00:15:19,225 --> 00:15:21,160
Of course!

261
00:15:21,427 --> 00:15:24,030
Then prove it.

262
00:15:40,013 --> 00:15:42,382
There. Was that so hard?

263
00:15:46,719 --> 00:15:49,989
This can't be happening. This can't be happening.

264
00:15:50,023 --> 00:15:51,591
This can't be happening.

265
00:15:51,624 --> 00:15:54,661
J.T. when was the last place you remember having it?

266
00:15:55,295 --> 00:15:56,629
What are you, my mother?

267
00:15:56,663 --> 00:16:00,300
If I knew that I'd have it right now. I lost it!

268
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:01,634
So sue me!

269
00:16:01,668 --> 00:16:05,204
J.T., you find that can or I will sue you.

270
00:16:05,505 --> 00:16:07,573
Spin. shouldn't you be at work?

271
00:16:07,607 --> 00:16:11,244
He has his priorities. And his priority, right now?

272
00:16:11,277 --> 00:16:14,247
To hurt J.T. I told him everything.

273
00:16:14,514 --> 00:16:17,417
Guys. I'll make it up to you. I'll be your slave --

274
00:16:17,450 --> 00:16:19,419
Sorry? I don't speak dork.

275
00:16:20,353 --> 00:16:22,322
J.T. you're gonna find that can.

276
00:16:22,355 --> 00:16:24,390
If I have to stuff you in your locker to--

277
00:16:24,424 --> 00:16:27,026
My locker!! That's it!

278
00:16:32,231 --> 00:16:33,599
No, they're not in there.

279
00:16:33,633 --> 00:16:35,468
It's in a plastic bag ...

280
00:16:58,257 --> 00:17:00,326
There it is!

281
00:17:01,627 --> 00:17:07,266
Ace of spades, ace of clubs -- we're rich!

282
00:17:08,501 --> 00:17:13,239
You - moron! They're both clubs.

283
00:17:13,806 --> 00:17:16,275
Oh no...

284
00:17:16,409 --> 00:17:21,280
Ace of spades, ace of clubs- they're so similar...

285
00:17:22,415 --> 00:17:24,384
I knew it was a mistake-

286
00:17:24,417 --> 00:17:27,053
Hooking up with a bunch of loser grade 7's.

287
00:17:27,787 --> 00:17:31,224
Guys, c'mon. Ow. Ow. Help! Help!

288
00:17:35,261 --> 00:17:37,830
I think I like the shorter skirts better, Oskar.

289
00:17:37,864 --> 00:17:42,101
In the blue and gold. Oh yeah. That's it.

290
00:17:42,702 --> 00:17:45,838
Yeah, I think that looks way better.

291
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:50,276
You guys know anything about this?

292
00:17:50,610 --> 00:17:52,445
Who would do something like that?

293
00:17:52,478 --> 00:17:53,713
You tell me.

294
00:17:53,746 --> 00:17:56,549
My opinion piece was ripped out of every copy of the Grapevine.

295
00:17:56,582 --> 00:17:57,817
Well, I had nothing to do with it.

296
00:17:57,850 --> 00:18:01,387
No one's accusing you, Paige. Even if it was Emma 's critique

297
00:18:01,421 --> 00:18:03,523
of the spirit squad that was attacked...

298
00:18:03,556 --> 00:18:05,425
I don't have to tell you that vandalism

299
00:18:05,458 --> 00:18:08,761
can result in suspension. This is pretty serious.

300
00:18:11,330 --> 00:18:12,498
Mr. Simpson?

301
00:18:12,532 --> 00:18:13,766
-- let me, Manny.

302
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:17,804
If anyone should tell you this, mr. Simpson, it should be me.

303
00:18:17,837 --> 00:18:21,841
As head of the spirit squad. But-

304
00:18:21,874 --> 00:18:24,844
We saw Hazel hanging around the foyer earlier.

305
00:18:24,877 --> 00:18:26,879
Acting suspicious.

306
00:18:26,913 --> 00:18:28,815
More incidents like this, and the school may question

307
00:18:28,848 --> 00:18:31,417
having extracurricular activities at all.

308
00:18:31,451 --> 00:18:34,454
Including the spirit squad. You got it?

309
00:18:43,696 --> 00:18:46,599
So - two more people signed up! We're really on our way.

310
00:18:46,632 --> 00:18:49,402
Why did you do that? Why did you backstab Hazel?

311
00:18:49,435 --> 00:18:51,737
Hello? I had to give up somebody.

312
00:18:51,771 --> 00:18:53,773
And you were about to spill your guts.

313
00:18:53,806 --> 00:18:55,341
I was simply looking out for you.

314
00:18:55,374 --> 00:18:56,342
Well don't, okay?

315
00:18:56,375 --> 00:18:58,611
Not if it means dragging me into your dirty work.

316
00:18:58,644 --> 00:19:00,880
My dirty work? You were there, too.

317
00:19:00,913 --> 00:19:02,915
Yeah, I ripped one newspaper -

318
00:19:02,949 --> 00:19:05,718
One? More like all. at least, that's what I'll tell

319
00:19:05,751 --> 00:19:07,787
Mr. Simpson if you don't shut up.

320
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:09,188
Paige, you were the one who--

321
00:19:09,222 --> 00:19:11,757
who is he gonna believe - you or me?

322
00:19:12,425 --> 00:19:14,527
Let's go find out.

323
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:16,229
Manny - what is your damage?

324
00:19:16,262 --> 00:19:17,597
You, Paige.

325
00:19:17,630 --> 00:19:18,798
You'd better watch your mouth--

326
00:19:18,831 --> 00:19:21,601
or what? You'll spread lies about me? Deface my locker?

327
00:19:21,634 --> 00:19:23,536
Just try it.

328
00:19:31,944 --> 00:19:36,415
Fyi? Your attitude sucks. Good luck making the squad.

329
00:20:13,386 --> 00:20:14,453
Hey.

330
00:20:14,587 --> 00:20:15,922
Hey.

331
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:22,728
Can I sit down?

332
00:20:22,762 --> 00:20:24,864
Sure.

333
00:20:36,375 --> 00:20:38,844
Manny, I wanted to apologize.

334
00:20:38,878 --> 00:20:41,747
I should've supported your cheerleading. Not attacked you.

335
00:20:41,781 --> 00:20:44,750
Why? It's just a bunch of stupid sexist idiot girls

336
00:20:44,784 --> 00:20:46,385
prancing around--

337
00:20:46,419 --> 00:20:50,022
Manny. I was wrong. I'm admitting it.

338
00:20:51,524 --> 00:20:55,294
It's just - all I wanted to do was have fun, Em.

339
00:20:55,328 --> 00:20:57,630
And then Paige took an interest in me,

340
00:20:57,663 --> 00:21:01,834
and then it all became so complicated. I'm sorry.

341
00:21:04,670 --> 00:21:08,541
So what're you gonna do? About the spirit squad, I mean.

342
00:21:08,574 --> 00:21:12,044
Give it up. Paige won't want me anymore.

343
00:21:12,078 --> 00:21:13,879
Not after what I said to her...

344
00:21:14,013 --> 00:21:16,682
Manny - you're good. Paige is mean, not dumb.

345
00:21:16,716 --> 00:21:19,018
She's not going to cut you from the squad.

346
00:21:19,051 --> 00:21:23,556
Besides, what you said? I thought it was amazing.

347
00:21:24,690 --> 00:21:27,526
You were there?

348
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:32,365
And you know what? I couldn't have said it better myself.
