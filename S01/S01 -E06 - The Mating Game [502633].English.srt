1
00:00:03,344 --> 00:00:04,712
DO YOU THINK JIMMY WILL LIKE IT?

2
00:00:04,745 --> 00:00:10,551
IT IS SO PERFECT. ROMANTIC YET MASCULINE. JUST LIKE JIMMY.

3
00:00:10,584 --> 00:00:13,253
SHAKESPEARE'S LANGUAGE CAN BE HARD TO FOLLOW.

4
00:00:13,287 --> 00:00:14,388
SO WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO IS

5
00:00:14,421 --> 00:00:15,589
WE'RE GOING TO BREAK UP INTO GROUPS

6
00:00:15,622 --> 00:00:19,460
AND WE'RE GOING TO PERFORM SCENES FROM ROMEO AND JULIET.

7
00:00:19,493 --> 00:00:21,562
OH, COME ON!

8
00:00:21,595 --> 00:00:23,063
WE'RE GOING TO PERFORM THE SCENES NEXT WEEK

9
00:00:23,097 --> 00:00:25,432
WITH THE TEXT FULLY MEMORIZED.

10
00:00:25,466 --> 00:00:28,202
I'M PLAY BALTHAZAR. WHO'S SHE?

11
00:00:28,235 --> 00:00:31,305
HE IS ROMEO'S SERVANT.

12
00:00:31,338 --> 00:00:34,708
LET ME GUESS. YOU'RE JULIET AND JIMMY'S ROMEO.

13
00:00:34,742 --> 00:00:37,578
HE'S ROMEO. BUT I'M THE NURSE.

14
00:00:37,611 --> 00:00:39,146
SO WHO'S JULIET?

15
00:00:40,848 --> 00:00:43,684
"ROMEO, O ROMEO, WHEREFORE ARE THOU, ROMEO?"

16

00:01:41,408 --> 00:01:42,910
TO DEGRASSI - TODAY.

28
00:01:42,943 --> 00:01:44,912
WHO'S DR. SALLY?

29
00:01:44,945 --> 00:01:46,513
THE SEX LADY.

30
00:01:46,547 --> 00:01:48,482
BUT SHE'S ONLY TALKING TO THE EIGHTH GRADERS

31
00:01:48,515 --> 00:01:49,450
- OF COURSE.

32
00:01:49,483 --> 00:01:50,150
OF COURSE.

33
00:01:50,184 --> 00:01:51,885
IT'S TOTALLY UNFAIR.

34
00:01:51,919 --> 00:01:56,523
I HEARD THAT SHE BRINGS LIKE PROPS. AND SHE GETS GRAPHIC -

35
00:01:56,557 --> 00:02:01,595
AS IN PORNOGRAPHIC. EIGHTH GRADERS GET ALL THE LUCK.

36
00:02:08,402 --> 00:02:11,305
OKAY, PEOPLE, AS WE DISCUSSED AT THE END OF THE LAST CLASS,

37
00:02:11,338 --> 00:02:12,906
TODAY YOU GUYS ARE GOING TO CREATE A WEBSITE

38
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:15,275
ON AN ANIMAL OF YOUR CHOICE.

39
00:02:15,309 --> 00:02:15,642
OOH.

40
00:02:17,344 --> 00:02:20,614
CAN WE DO IT ON A SPECIFIC ANIMAL - LIKE MAMA ONU?

41
00:02:20,647 --> 00:02:21,582
MAMA WHO?

42
00:02:22,716 --> 00:02:23,250
MAMA ONU. SHE'S AN ENDANGERED GREEN TURTLE

43
00:02:23,283 --> 00:02:24,485
FROM THE SOUTH PACIFIC.

44
00:02:24,518 --> 00:02:25,586
THAT SOUNDS VERY INFORMATIVE. YOU KNOW,

45
00:02:25,619 --> 00:02:29,490
BUT DON'T FORGET TO HAVE FUN AND USE THE TECHNOLOGY

46
00:02:29,523 --> 00:02:31,325
AND YOUR IMAGINATION, OKAY?

47
00:02:31,358 --> 00:02:33,660
THAT'S WHAT THIS IS ALL ABOUT IS TAKING THE TECHNOLOGY

48
00:02:33,694 --> 00:02:34,795
TO THE NEXT STEP.

49
00:02:34,828 --> 00:02:38,365
♪ SHE WANTS ME, SHE NEEDS ME, SHE LOVES ME...♪

50
00:02:40,367 --> 00:02:42,536
♪ BUT SHE DOESN'T KNOW IT YET

51
00:02:42,569 --> 00:02:42,903
WOW.

52
00:02:44,938 --> 00:02:45,539
TOBY.

53
00:02:54,014 --> 00:02:56,617
HEY MAN, THANKS FOR LETTING ME BORROW YOUR NOTES.

54
00:02:56,650 --> 00:02:59,353
YEAH. NO PROBLEM, SEAN.

55
00:03:00,454 --> 00:03:02,956
REALLY? THAT'S YOUR FRIEND'S BROTHER?

56
00:03:02,990 --> 00:03:04,458
YOU OKAY?

57
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:08,829
YEAH... YEAH. FINE. PERFECT.

58
00:03:10,464 --> 00:03:14,334
AS THE MALE BECOMES AROUSED, THE PENIS FILLS WITH BLOOD

59
00:03:14,368 --> 00:03:16,370
AND HE GETS AN ERECTION.

60
00:03:16,837 --> 00:03:21,008
NOW IF YOU WANT TO AVOID HERPES, AIDS, CHLAMYDIA

61
00:03:21,041 --> 00:03:24,611
AND AN UNPLANNED PREGNANCY, YOU MUST PRACTICE SAFER SEX

62
00:03:24,645 --> 00:03:27,581
BY USING ONE OF THESE - A CONDOM.

63
00:03:28,515 --> 00:03:32,953
ROLL A CONDOM DOWN OVER THE PENIS RIGHT TO THE BASE,

64
00:03:32,986 --> 00:03:37,658
LEAVING A SPACE AT THE TIP. THIS IS VERY EMBARRASSING,

65
00:03:37,691 --> 00:03:41,962
I KNOW THAT. BUT IT'S SOMETHING YOU REALLY NEED TO KNOW.

66
00:03:41,995 --> 00:03:44,665
PROTECTION FOR BOTH OF YOU. YES?

67
00:03:45,532 --> 00:03:50,337
UM, YEAH, I HAVE A FRIEND. HE'S ABOUT MY AGE.

68
00:03:51,705 --> 00:03:54,675
HE AND HIS GIRLFRIEND ARE LIKE TOTALLY SERIOUS.

69
00:03:54,708 --> 00:03:56,610
I'M TALKING LIKE EIGHT MONTHS SERIOUS.

70
00:03:56,643 --> 00:03:57,811
MHM.

71
00:03:57,844 --> 00:04:00,047
AND AH, HOW ARE THEY SUPPOSED TO KNOW WHEN

72
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:03,684
OR IF THEY'RE READY TO, YOU KNOW, DO IT?

73
00:04:03,717 --> 00:04:08,055
WELL, ANATOMICALLY PHYSICALLY YOU'RE READY RIGHT NOW.

74
00:04:08,088 --> 00:04:10,591
BUT EMOTIONALLY, PSYCHOLOGICALLY,

75
00:04:10,624 --> 00:04:13,827
WE'RE NOT SURE. YOU HAVE TO BE ABLE TO DECIDE.

76
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:16,530
DECIDE WHETHER YOU LIKE YOUR BODY-

77
00:04:16,563 --> 00:04:20,567
OKAY, I WILL NEVER EAT ANOTHER BANANA AS LONG AS I LIVE.

78
00:04:20,601 --> 00:04:22,402
I THINK IT WAS GOOD SHE WAS SO BLUNT.

79
00:04:22,436 --> 00:04:24,871
I MEAN WE'RE NOT ALL GOING TO WAIT UNTIL WE GET MARRIED.

80
00:04:24,905 --> 00:04:27,841
I'M GOING TO STRANGLE SPINNER. CAN YOU BELIEVE HE ASKED THAT?

81
00:04:27,874 --> 00:04:29,610
I MEAN, HELLO, WHO ELSE IN THIS SCHOOL

82
00:04:29,643 --> 00:04:31,411
HAS BEEN GOING OUT FOR EIGHT MONTHS?

83
00:04:31,445 --> 00:04:32,779
WELL, WHAT ABOUT YOU AND JIMMY?

84
00:04:32,813 --> 00:04:35,882
I MEAN EIGHT MONTHS IS A LONG TIME.

85
00:04:35,916 --> 00:04:38,885
OUR RELATIONSHIP IS DEEP ENOUGH WITHOUT SEX.

86
00:04:38,919 --> 00:04:41,888
LOOK WHAT HE MADE ME FOR OUR ANNIVERSARY.

87
00:04:41,922 --> 00:04:44,725
IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE HIS HEART.

88
00:04:44,758 --> 00:04:45,892
IT LOOKS MORE LIKE A PILE OF-

89
00:04:45,926 --> 00:04:48,595
I THINK IT'S SWEET.

90
00:04:48,629 --> 00:04:49,796
IT IS SO ROMANTIC.

91
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:51,431
ROMANTIC OR-

92
00:04:51,465 --> 00:04:52,599
WHAT?

93
00:04:52,633 --> 00:04:55,636
WELL, YOU GOT HIM A $50 SILVER CHAIN, RIGHT?

94
00:04:55,669 --> 00:04:59,940
AND HE GOT YOU A HUNK OF CLAY? BUT, WHAT DO I KNOW?

95
00:05:09,716 --> 00:05:14,054
SPINNER IS READING? QUICK, RECORD THE TIME OF DAY.

96
00:05:14,087 --> 00:05:17,090
YO MAN, SHAKESPEARE WAS WILD.

97
00:05:17,124 --> 00:05:20,527
JULIET LIKE DOES IT WITH ROMEO AT THIRTEEN.

98
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:23,630
YOU KNOW, I GUESS SHE WAS READY PHYSICALLY AND EMOTIONALLY,

99
00:05:23,664 --> 00:05:24,398
YOU KNOW?

100
00:05:25,565 --> 00:05:29,469
HEY ROMEO, I'VE MEMORIZED MY LINES ALREADY.

101
00:05:31,605 --> 00:05:35,575
I HEARD SHE DID IT LAST SUMMER AT CAMP WITH THE COUNSELLOR.

102
00:05:35,609 --> 00:05:37,978
I HAVE A GIRLFRIEND. REMEMBER?

103
00:05:38,011 --> 00:05:42,649
RIGHT. ASHLEY YOU'LL-NEVER-GET PAST-SECOND-BASE KERWIN.

104
00:05:42,683 --> 00:05:45,619
SPINNER YOU-BETTER-SHUT-YOUR MOUTH MASON.

105
00:05:45,652 --> 00:05:48,855
LOOK, ALL I'M SAYING IS YOU'VE GOT TWO DINERS

106
00:05:48,889 --> 00:05:50,924
BUT ONLY ONE IS SELLING FRIES.

107
00:05:50,957 --> 00:05:53,527
AND YOU'VE REALLY GOT A CRAVING FOR FRIES.

108
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:54,428
SHUT UP!

109
00:05:57,597 --> 00:06:01,168
I COULD HELP YOU WITH YOUR ASSIGNMENT. I GET STRAIGHT A'S.

110
00:06:01,201 --> 00:06:05,605
AND I GET STRAIGHT D'S. SO WHY ROCK THE BOAT?

111
00:06:07,841 --> 00:06:09,176
OH. HEY, SEAN.

112
00:06:13,447 --> 00:06:15,916
THE LEATHERBACK TURTLE. IS THAT FOR MEDIA IMMERSION?

113
00:06:15,949 --> 00:06:18,118
ISN'T EMMA ALREADY DOING ENDANGERED TURTLES

114
00:06:18,151 --> 00:06:19,820
FOR HER ASSIGNMENT?

115
00:06:19,853 --> 00:06:22,055
I WAS INSPIRED AFTER LEARNING ABOUT MAMA ONU

116
00:06:22,089 --> 00:06:26,159
TO UNCOVER THE PLIGHT OF OTHER TURTLES. THAT'S OKAY ISN'T IT?

117
00:06:26,193 --> 00:06:29,162
OF COURSE. WHO KNEW I COULD HAVE SUCH AN IMPACT.

118
00:06:29,196 --> 00:06:31,498
YOU KNOW, I SAW THIS DVD IN THE VIDEO STORE

119
00:06:31,531 --> 00:06:32,733
THE OTHER DAY.

120
00:06:32,766 --> 00:06:34,668
IT'S A DOCUMENTARY ON ENDANGERED SPECIES.

121
00:06:34,701 --> 00:06:36,536
WE SHOULD WATCH IT TOMORROW NIGHT.

122
00:06:36,570 --> 00:06:38,105
I THOUGHT WE WERE GOING TO THE MOVIES.

123
00:06:38,138 --> 00:06:39,740
MAYBE THE FUTURE OF HELPLESS ANIMALS

124
00:06:39,773 --> 00:06:42,042
IS A LITTLE MORE IMPORTANT THAN THAT.

125
00:06:42,075 --> 00:06:45,512
WE CAN WATCH IT AT MY PLACE. MY DAD WON'T LET ME GO OUT

126
00:06:45,545 --> 00:06:49,082
ON A SCHOOL NIGHT. BUT YOU GUYS CAN COME OVER.

127
00:06:49,116 --> 00:06:52,719
HOW ABOUT YOU, SEAN? WANT TO COME?

128
00:06:57,224 --> 00:07:01,561
NO, I'VE GOT OTHER PLANS. SEE YOU GUYS LATER.

129
00:07:08,769 --> 00:07:10,637
DON'T YOU THINK THAT WAS A BIT MUCH?

130
00:07:10,670 --> 00:07:13,840
'OH HI, EMMA. I'VE RENTED THIS DVD FOR TOMORROW NIGHT.'

131
00:07:13,874 --> 00:07:15,642
J. T., YOU BETTER SHUT UP.

132
00:07:15,675 --> 00:07:17,677
'I WAS SO INSPIRED BY MAMA ONU

133
00:07:17,711 --> 00:07:19,112
AND THE PLIGHT OF OTHER TURTLES.

134
00:07:19,146 --> 00:07:20,981
EMMA, I - I LOVE YOU.'

135
00:07:23,517 --> 00:07:25,652
YOU DO KNOW THAT PHYSICAL VIOLENCE VIOLATES

136
00:07:25,685 --> 00:07:28,822
THE DEGRASSI CODE OF CONDUCT, DON'T YOU?

137
00:07:30,624 --> 00:07:33,627
VIOLATES THE CODE OF CONDUCT?

138
00:07:34,027 --> 00:07:38,498
I'LL BE BACK IN A COUPLE OF MINUTES.

139
00:07:38,532 --> 00:07:40,834
OH VENDOR SAINT, LET LIPS DO ENHANCE YOU,

140
00:07:40,867 --> 00:07:45,138
THEY PRAY. GRANT NOW, LEST FATE TURN TO DESPAIR.

141
00:07:45,172 --> 00:07:47,774
SAINTS DO NOT MOVE GRANT NOW FOR PRAYER'S SAKE.

142
00:07:47,808 --> 00:07:50,277
THEN MOVE NOT WHILE MY PRAYERS AFFECT THY TAKE.

143
00:07:50,310 --> 00:07:54,047
THUS FROM MY LIPS BY THINE MY SIN IS PERCHED.

144
00:07:56,550 --> 00:07:58,585
MADAM, YOUR MOTHER CRAVES A WORD WITH YOU.

145
00:07:58,618 --> 00:08:01,588
ASHLEY, YOU DON'T COME IN FOR ANOTHER HALF PAGE.

146
00:08:01,621 --> 00:08:03,924
OKAY, WHY DON'T WE START FROM THE TOP AND KEEP DOING

147
00:08:03,957 --> 00:08:08,128
WHAT YOU'RE DOING BECAUSE YOUR CHEMISTRY IS GREAT.

148
00:08:11,331 --> 00:08:12,566
ASH, DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

149
00:08:12,599 --> 00:08:14,201
IT'S JUST A HOMEWORK ASSIGNMENT.

150
00:08:14,234 --> 00:08:16,303
YOU DON'T GET IT. EVEN WHEN WE WERE LITTLE,

151
00:08:16,336 --> 00:08:18,939
ANYTHING I EVER HAD, PAIGE HAD TO HAVE TOO.

152
00:08:18,972 --> 00:08:21,842
I HAVE TO DRAW THE LINE AT MY BOYFRIEND.

153
00:08:21,875 --> 00:08:24,978
WELL, I'LL SEE YOU LATER.

154
00:08:25,011 --> 00:08:27,581
HEY ASH, YOU WERE A GREAT NURSE.

155
00:08:27,614 --> 00:08:29,816
I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING, PAIGE MICHAELCHUK.

156
00:08:29,850 --> 00:08:30,984
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

157
00:08:31,017 --> 00:08:33,553
I'M NOT BLIND. YOU WERE ALL OVER JIMMY IN THERE.

158
00:08:33,587 --> 00:08:35,188
IT'S CALLED REHEARSAL.

159
00:08:35,222 --> 00:08:36,756
IT'S CALLED BACK STABBING.

160
00:08:36,790 --> 00:08:38,558
ASHLEY, WE'RE STUDYING ROMEO AND JULIET -

161
00:08:38,592 --> 00:08:40,260
NOT JULIUS CAESAR, OKAY?

162
00:08:40,293 --> 00:08:42,929
WHAT DOES THAT EVEN MEAN?

163
00:08:42,963 --> 00:08:44,998
ANYWAY, JUST BECAUSE YOU TWO HAVE BEEN GOING OUT FOR LIKE

164
00:08:45,031 --> 00:08:48,001
FOREVER DOESN'T MEAN THAT JIMMY IS BORED OF YOU.

165
00:08:48,034 --> 00:08:50,237
AT LEAST HE'S NEVER SAID SO TO ME.

166
00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:51,605
YOU'VE HEARD JIMMY IS BORED WITH ME?

167
00:08:51,638 --> 00:08:56,243
NOT AT ALL. BUT IF I WERE YOU, I'D MAKE SURE HE WASN'T -

168
00:08:56,276 --> 00:09:00,947
BEFORE SOMEONE WITH A LITTLE MORE CHEMISTRY COMES ALONG.

169
00:09:07,787 --> 00:09:10,023
HEY, ASHLEY. I WAS LOOKING FOR YOU. I JUST -

170
00:09:10,056 --> 00:09:11,324
YEAH.

171
00:09:11,892 --> 00:09:13,960
WHOA. WHAT WAS THAT FOR?

172
00:09:13,994 --> 00:09:15,962
DIDN'T YOU LIKE IT?

173
00:09:15,996 --> 00:09:17,264
SURE.

174
00:09:17,297 --> 00:09:19,633
WELL, IF YOU LIKE THAT YOU'LL LOVE WHAT I HAVE PLANNED

175
00:09:19,666 --> 00:09:21,067
FOR OUR ANNIVERSARY.

176
00:09:21,101 --> 00:09:22,769
MOM IS GOING TO SEE JEFF PERFORM IN HIS ORCHESTRA

177
00:09:22,802 --> 00:09:24,871
AND TOBY IS GOING TO A FRIEND'S HOUSE.

178
00:09:24,905 --> 00:09:29,743
SO WE'LL BE ALL ALONE. REMEMBER WHAT DR. SALLY SAID TODAY?

179
00:09:30,377 --> 00:09:31,711
WELL, I'M READY.

180
00:09:37,217 --> 00:09:40,720

181
00:09:42,422 --> 00:09:43,857
HEY!

182
00:09:43,890 --> 00:09:45,825
WHAT'S WITH YOU TODAY?

183
00:09:45,859 --> 00:09:51,865
FOR OUR ANNIVERSARY, ASH WANTS TO GIVE ME THE ULTIMATE GIFT.

184
00:09:51,898 --> 00:09:53,900
A FERRARI.

185
00:09:53,934 --> 00:09:58,672
YOU'RE SUCH AN IDIOT. NO. WHAT JULIET GAVE ROMEO.

186
00:10:01,041 --> 00:10:04,945
ASH WANTS TO HAVE SEX! MAN, YOU'RE GONNA GET SOME?

187
00:10:04,978 --> 00:10:06,646
YOU GOT HORSESHOES UP YOUR BUTT.

188
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:07,914
YEAH COOL, HUH?

189
00:10:07,948 --> 00:10:09,649
LOOK, TO MARK THIS HEROIC OCCASION

190
00:10:09,683 --> 00:10:13,987
I THINK YOU BETTER GET LITTLE JIMMY JR. THERE A PRESENT.

191
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:15,088
WHAT?

192
00:10:15,722 --> 00:10:17,324
CONDOMS, YOU IDIOT.

193
00:10:17,357 --> 00:10:19,292
CONDOMS. RIGHT.

194
00:10:25,298 --> 00:10:28,301
FRENCH DELIGHT, THAI TICKLER.

195
00:10:28,335 --> 00:10:31,137
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU CAN BUY CONDOMS ON THE NET.

196
00:10:31,171 --> 00:10:34,808
TERRI, YOU CAN BUY ANYTHING ON THE NET.

197
00:10:34,841 --> 00:10:38,144
WHY ISN'T JIMMY, YOU KNOW, TAKING CARE OF THIS?

198
00:10:38,178 --> 00:10:39,779
YOU HEARD WHAT DR. SALLY SAID.

199
00:10:39,813 --> 00:10:42,949
IT'S THE GUY'S AND THE GIRL'S RESPONSIBILITY.

200
00:10:42,983 --> 00:10:45,251
ARE YOU SURE YOU'RE MAKING THE RIGHT DECISION?

201
00:10:45,285 --> 00:10:48,121
OF COURSE. I MEAN JIMMY AND I LOVE EACH OTHER, RIGHT?

202
00:10:48,154 --> 00:10:50,223
IT'S JUST YOU SAID YOUR RELATIONSHIP

203
00:10:50,256 --> 00:10:52,292
WAS DEEP ENOUGH WITHOUT SEX. THEN PAIGE-

204
00:10:52,325 --> 00:10:55,228
THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH PAIGE.

205
00:10:55,261 --> 00:10:59,165
I JUST DON'T WANT YOU TO REGRET THIS LATER. IT'S A BIG DEAL.

206
00:10:59,199 --> 00:11:01,034
I CAN'T BELIEVE I'M LISTENING TO RELATIONSHIP ADVICE

207
00:11:01,067 --> 00:11:04,270
FROM SOMEONE WHO'S NEVER EVEN HAD A DATE.

208
00:11:05,005 --> 00:11:07,941
OKAY, I'M GOING TO BE LATE FOR DINNER.

209
00:11:38,772 --> 00:11:40,373
THERE'S NOTHING!

210
00:11:40,407 --> 00:11:41,541
SOMETHING WRONG?

211
00:11:41,574 --> 00:11:43,309
YEAH. PEOPLE THAT ARE HUNTING GREEN TURTLES

212
00:11:43,343 --> 00:11:45,311
HAVE ALSO WIPED THEM OFF CYBER SPACE.

213
00:11:45,345 --> 00:11:46,913
HM, CAN I TRY?

214
00:11:46,946 --> 00:11:49,883
GO AHEAD. BUT IT'S HOPELESS...

215
00:11:54,888 --> 00:11:56,456
HOW DID YOU DO THAT?

216
00:11:56,489 --> 00:11:59,426
IT'S A LITTLE GIFT I HAVE.

IF YOU WANT TO DO SOMETHING ELSE.

230
00:12:42,235 --> 00:12:43,336
WHY WOULD I WANT TO DO THAT?

231
00:12:43,369 --> 00:12:45,405
WELL, THE SCENE IS ALL ABOUT JIMMY AND ME.

232
00:12:45,438 --> 00:12:48,475
SO WHY SHOULD YOU WAIT AROUND FOR WHAT, JUST TWO LINES?

00:13:21,407 --> 00:13:22,375

00:13:28,882 --> 00:13:31,417
OH! MOM, WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

241
00:13:31,451 --> 00:13:34,220
LAST TIME I LOOKED, I LIVED HERE.

242
00:13:34,254 --> 00:13:35,655
BUT AREN'T YOU GOING TO SEE JEFF PERFORM TONIGHT?

243
00:13:35,688 --> 00:13:38,358
YEP. THAT'S WHY I HAD TO COME HOME AND MAKE MYSELF GORGEOUS.

244
00:13:38,391 --> 00:13:40,994
(Knock at door)

245
00:13:41,027 --> 00:13:41,427
OH. I'LL GET IT.

246
00:13:41,461 --> 00:13:42,395

PACKAGE FOR YOU.

248
00:13:52,338 --> 00:13:53,339
HI.

249
00:14:02,448 --> 00:14:05,285
HEY, WHAT'S IN THE BOX?

250
00:14:05,318 --> 00:14:08,922
OH AH, YOU KNOW, JUST GIRL STUFF.

251
00:14:08,955 --> 00:14:11,224
GIRL STUFF? WHAT KIND OF GIRL STUFF?

252
00:14:11,257 --> 00:14:12,025
MOM?

253
00:14:12,058 --> 00:14:13,459
OKAY, OKAY.

00:14:24,304 --> 00:14:28,041
WELL, COME ON. THEY WON'T BITE YOU.

255
00:14:35,415 --> 00:14:36,616
I'LL GET THESE.

256
00:14:36,649 --> 00:14:39,252
WELL, ARE YOU SURE THIS IS THE RIGHT SIZE FOR YOU?

257
00:14:39,285 --> 00:14:43,890
CAUSE WE'VE GOT SMALL, MEDIUM, LARGE AND EXTRA LARGE.

258
00:14:44,457 --> 00:14:45,391
THOSE ARE FINE.

259
00:14:45,425 --> 00:14:47,360
THEN YOU'VE ALSO GOT YOUR CHOICE

260
00:14:47,393 --> 00:14:50,196
OF REGULAR AND SUPER SENSITIVE.

261
00:14:50,496 --> 00:14:52,198
JUST RING THEM IN.

262
00:14:52,498 --> 00:14:54,000
BUT THEN THERE'S COLOURS TO THINK OF.

263
00:14:54,033 --> 00:14:55,268
BECAUSE PERSONALLY, I THINK A LITTLE BIT OF COLOUR

264
00:14:55,301 --> 00:14:56,336
SPICES THINGS UP.

265
00:14:56,369 --> 00:14:59,439
JUST RING THEM IN, PLEASE.

266
00:14:59,472 --> 00:15:00,540
OKAY.

267
00:15:15,054 --> 00:15:15,388
HEY.

268
00:15:16,422 --> 00:15:16,489
HI.

269
00:15:28,234 --> 00:15:28,968
SO?

270
00:15:30,403 --> 00:15:31,404
RIGHT.

271
00:15:57,463 --> 00:15:59,365
ARE YOU SURE MY EDITORIAL ON SCHOOL FOUNTAINS

272
00:15:59,399 --> 00:16:01,601
BACTERIA BREEDERS ISN'T TOO LONG?

273
00:16:01,634 --> 00:16:02,936
POSITIVE.

274
00:16:02,969 --> 00:16:08,308
GREAT. HEY, ON THE WAY HOME WANT TO GRAB A SMOOTHIE?

275
00:16:08,341 --> 00:16:11,444
UM, ACTUALLY, I FORGOT.

276
00:16:11,477 --> 00:16:14,380
FORGOT WHAT? NOT SOMETHING FOR THE PAPER I HOPE?

277
00:16:14,414 --> 00:16:18,584
NO. SEAN ASKED ME TO HELP HIM AFTER SCHOOL. I'VE GOTTA RUN.

278
00:16:18,618 --> 00:16:22,188
OKAY. SEE YOU TOMORROW THEN. OR, AS THEY SAY IN ITALY,

279
00:16:22,221 --> 00:16:22,755
A DOMANI.

280
00:16:31,297 --> 00:16:34,467
SPRINGER SPANIELS? HARDLY ON THE ENDANGERED LIST.

281
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:37,570
SO? MR. SIMPSON DIDN'T SAY THEY HAD TO BE.

282
00:16:37,603 --> 00:16:42,775
NO, YOU'RE RIGHT. OF COURSE NOT. WHY SPRINGER SPANIELS?

283
00:16:46,145 --> 00:16:50,383
I USED TO HAVE ONE WHEN I LIVED WITH MY PARENTS. CHARLIE.

284
00:16:50,416 --> 00:16:51,684
WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM?

285
00:16:51,718 --> 00:16:53,486
I HAD TO LEAVE HIM.

286
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:57,323
MY BROTHER'S BUILDING, IT DOESN'T ALLOW DOGS.

287
00:16:57,357 --> 00:16:59,425
YOU MUST MISS HIM.

288
00:17:00,126 --> 00:17:03,463
HE WAS SORT OF DUMB, YOU KNOW. HE CHASED HIS OWN TAIL.

289
00:17:03,496 --> 00:17:07,433
HE WAS AFRAID OF CATS. BUT, I MISS HIM - A LOT.

290
00:17:20,813 --> 00:17:22,749
WHAT'S WRONG?

291
00:17:25,518 --> 00:17:26,119
ASH?...

292
00:17:27,286 --> 00:17:29,355
I'M AH, I'M JUST GOING TO GO AND FRESHEN UP.

293
00:17:29,389 --> 00:17:30,790
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

294
00:17:35,795 --> 00:17:37,630
COME ON, ASH. GROW UP!

295
00:17:42,602 --> 00:17:45,304
YOU CAN DO THIS. JUST GROW UP.

296
00:17:56,816 --> 00:17:58,651
SORRY ABOUT THAT, I--.

297
00:18:00,153 --> 00:18:02,155
ASH, WHAT'S WRONG?

298
00:18:04,323 --> 00:18:08,494
I CAN'T. I'M SORRY, JIMMY, BUT I JUST CAN'T.

299
00:18:08,861 --> 00:18:11,164
MAYBE SOMEBODY LIKE PAIGE CAN.

300
00:18:11,197 --> 00:18:13,499
WHAT DID YOU SAY? ABOUT PAIGE?

301
00:18:14,667 --> 00:18:17,270
JUST - MAYBE SHE'S THE GIRL FOR YOU.

302
00:18:19,939 --> 00:18:21,574
YOU THINK BECAUSE OF THIS SHAKESPEARE STUFF,

303
00:18:21,607 --> 00:18:23,676
I WANT TO BE WITH PAIGE?

304
00:18:23,709 --> 00:18:28,314
SHE'S READY TO DO THIS. SHE'S DONE THIS. BUT I'M NOT.

305
00:18:31,451 --> 00:18:34,520
GOOD. CAUSE TO BE HONEST, NEITHER AM I.

306
00:18:44,964 --> 00:18:47,433
I CAN'T BELIEVE EMMA DIDN'T SHOW UP.

307
00:18:47,467 --> 00:18:51,237
SHE'S PROBABLY STILL AT SCHOOL. YOU KNOW WHAT LIBERTY IS LIKE.

308
00:18:51,270 --> 00:18:53,506
EMMA'S LUCKY. THAT BORING DVD

309
00:18:53,539 --> 00:18:56,843
ALMOST PUT ME ON THE ENDANGERED SPECIES LIST.

310
00:18:56,876 --> 00:18:59,345
I RENTED IT FOR HER!

311
00:19:10,356 --> 00:19:11,891
ASH, I'M HOME.

312
00:19:13,392 --> 00:19:16,796
OH, TOBY. UM, YOU'RE HOME EARLY.

313
00:19:17,330 --> 00:19:18,598
WE WERE JUST-

314
00:19:18,631 --> 00:19:20,566
UM, MAKING DECORATIONS.

315
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:22,435
YEAH. FOR THE DANCE.

316
00:19:22,468 --> 00:19:26,405
DO YOU THINK I'M A COMPLETE IDIOT?

317
00:19:26,439 --> 00:19:27,473
YOU BETTER GET THESE CONDOMS AWAY

318
00:19:27,507 --> 00:19:31,377
BEFORE DAD AND KATE GET HOME. I'M GOING TO BED.

319
00:19:31,410 --> 00:19:35,348
AND JIMMY, GIRLS ARE NOT WORTH IT - BELIEVE ME.

320
00:19:42,822 --> 00:19:43,823
OW!

321
00:19:48,528 --> 00:19:49,328
WHAT ARE YOU DRAWING?

322
00:19:49,362 --> 00:19:51,397
A SYMBOL OF OUR LOVE.

323
00:19:51,430 --> 00:19:53,599
OH, I ALMOST FORGOT...

324
00:19:59,005 --> 00:20:01,674
IF YOU DON'T LIKE IT THEN-

325
00:20:01,707 --> 00:20:05,378
NO. IT'S EXACTLY WHAT I WANT - JULIET.

326
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:08,481
ROMEO.

327
00:20:12,919 --> 00:20:14,420
--THE ONE ABOUT THE GUY THAT GOES BACK IN TIME?

328
00:20:14,453 --> 00:20:15,388
OH REALLY?

329
00:20:15,421 --> 00:20:16,255
YOU GUYS, SORRY ABOUT LAST NIGHT.

330
00:20:16,289 --> 00:20:18,457
DID LIBERTY CHEW YOUR EAR OFF?

331
00:20:18,491 --> 00:20:20,726
NO. I RAN INTO SEAN. WE JUST STARTED TALKING.

332
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:21,861
HE USED TO HAVE THIS DOG-

333
00:20:21,894 --> 00:20:24,397
OH. SO YOU DIDN'T EVEN BOTHER SHOWING UP.

334
00:20:24,430 --> 00:20:25,565
NOT EVEN A PHONE CALL?

335
00:20:25,598 --> 00:20:26,933
WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL?

336
00:20:26,966 --> 00:20:32,305
YOU SAID YOU'D COME. WHAT KIND OF FRIEND ARE YOU ANYWAY?

337
00:20:32,338 --> 00:20:34,507
WHAT'S HIS PROBLEM?

338
00:20:35,341 --> 00:20:38,644
AH, HE'S GOT A MAJOR CRUSH ON YOU.

339
00:20:39,712 --> 00:20:41,414
TOBY? WHAT?

340
00:20:45,051 --> 00:20:47,587
HEY. HOW'D IT GO?...

341
00:20:48,721 --> 00:20:50,890
AW... WHAT? YOU GUYS DIDN'T-

342
00:20:53,359 --> 00:20:55,828
MAN, WE WERE THIS CLOSE.

343
00:20:56,629 --> 00:20:59,532
THEN HER BROTHER CAME HOME EARLY. MESSED UP EVERYTHING.

344
00:20:59,565 --> 00:21:03,536
THAT SUCKS. WANT ME TO TAKE CARE OF HIM?

345
00:21:07,607 --> 00:21:10,009
HEY. ABOUT WHAT I SAID YESTERDAY?

346
00:21:10,042 --> 00:21:13,579
I WAS TOTALLY OUT OF LINE. I GUESS I WAS JUST NERVOUS.

347
00:21:13,613 --> 00:21:15,581
NOT THAT THAT'S AN EXCUSE.

348
00:21:15,615 --> 00:21:16,682
FINE.

349
00:21:17,717 --> 00:21:20,386
I'M SORRY, TERRI. I'M REALLY SORRY.

350
00:21:20,419 --> 00:21:22,755
ANYWAY, JIMMY REALLY LIKED HIS GIFT.

351
00:21:22,788 --> 00:21:25,024
YOU GUYS DIDN'T ACTUALLY...

352
00:21:25,057 --> 00:21:28,361
NO, OF COURSE NOT. IT WASN'T RIGHT.

353
00:21:28,394 --> 00:21:29,595
JIMMY WASN'T UPSET?

354
00:21:29,629 --> 00:21:32,431
NO, HE WAS PRETTY COOL ABOUT IT.

355
00:21:32,465 --> 00:21:35,301
ENTIRELY COOL ABOUT IT, ACTUALLY.
