1
00:00:03,944 --> 00:00:07,414
THIS IS GOING TO BE THE BEST YEAR EVER.

2
00:00:07,815 --> 00:00:10,084
FIRST THING WE NEED TO DO, TERRI

3
00:00:10,117 --> 00:00:12,753
IS WE NEED TO GET YOU A BOYFRIEND.

4
00:00:16,757 --> 00:00:18,225
IT WILL HAPPEN.

5
00:00:18,792 --> 00:00:19,526
TRUST ME.

6
00:00:22,596 --> 00:00:24,765
TERRI. I AM NOT A SHOE IN.

7
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:28,535
WE WON'T EVEN KNOW IF I'M PRESIDENT

8
00:00:28,569 --> 00:00:31,171
'TIL THE FINAL VOTE IS COUNTED.

9
00:00:31,205 --> 00:00:34,575
OKAY, YEAH, I JUST NEED TO HAVE A SHOWER AND GET DRESSED.

10
00:00:34,608 --> 00:00:36,210
OH NO, NOT AGAIN.

11
00:00:36,543 --> 00:00:38,512
TER, I'VE GOT TO GO.

12
00:00:38,545 --> 00:00:41,615
ALL RIGHT. I'LL SEE YOU AT SCHOOL. BYE.

13
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:44,318
TOBY OUT.

14
00:00:44,351 --> 00:00:46,820
HOW DO YOU KNOW IT'S ME? IT COULD BE YOUR MOM.

15
00:00:46,854 --> 00:00:48,389
COULD BE MY DAD.

16
00:00:48,889 --> 00:00:51,492
THEY HAVE THEIR OWN BATHROOM.

17
00:00:51,525 --> 00:00:53,527
THEN GO USE IT. I JUST GOT HERE.

18
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:55,629
TOBY COME ON, BE REASONABLE.

19
00:00:55,662 --> 00:00:58,365
I HAVE TO GET TO SCHOOL TO PUT UP MY ELECTION POSTERS.

20
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:00,701
AREN'T YOU THE ONLY ONE RUNNING?

21
00:01:00,734 --> 00:01:03,570
TOBY, REMEMBER WHAT DR. FREED SAID,

22
00:01:03,604 --> 00:01:06,673
A GENEROUS ATTITUDE MAKES FOR A GENEROUS FAMILY.

23
00:01:06,707 --> 00:01:09,376
NOW GET OUT OF THE BATHROOM NOW.

24
00:01:09,410 --> 00:01:13,280
TOBY WHAT WILL IT TAKE FOR YOU TO OPEN THAT DOOR?

25
00:01:13,313 --> 00:01:14,314
JUST SAY PLEASE.

26
00:01:14,348 --> 00:01:14,748
PLEASE.

27
00:01:15,849 --> 00:01:19,720
NOW SAY, TOBY ISAACS IS THE COOLEST KID AT DEGRASSI.

28
00:01:19,753 --> 00:01:22,489
WAY, WAY COOLER THAN ANY STUPID GRADE EIGHT

29
00:01:22,523 --> 00:01:23,424
COULD EVER HOPE TO BE.

30
00:01:23,457 --> 00:01:25,659
TOBY I HAVE TO GET SOMETHING.

31
00:01:27,294 --> 00:01:27,828
GET WHAT?

32
00:01:28,562 --> 00:01:30,364
YOUR HAIRBRUSH? YOUR EYELINER?

33
00:01:30,397 --> 00:01:32,099
YOUR TRAINING BRA.

34
00:01:35,269 --> 00:01:35,402
MOM.

35
00:02:29,623 --> 00:02:30,724
I MEAN I HADN'T EVEN SPIT OUT MY TOOTHPASTE

36
00:02:30,757 --> 00:02:32,192
AND SHE WANTED IN.

37
00:02:32,226 --> 00:02:33,427
MAYBE YOU SHOULD EXPLAIN TO ASHLEY

38
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:35,362
THAT BATHROOM TIME IS PRIVATE TIME.

39
00:02:35,395 --> 00:02:37,498
SHE'D PROBABLY GO CRYING TO MOMMY.

40
00:02:37,531 --> 00:02:38,565
REALLY?

41
00:02:38,599 --> 00:02:41,468
SHE HAS NO SENSE OF HUMOUR AND SHE'S A NEAT-AHOLIC.

42
00:02:41,502 --> 00:02:44,438
YESTERDAY I LEFT MY GYM SOCKS ON THE COUCH. SHE FREAKED.

43
00:02:44,471 --> 00:02:47,941
YOUR GYM SOCKS CAN REEK SOMETHING FIERCE.

44
00:02:47,975 --> 00:02:49,743
JUST 'CAUSE ME AND DAD MOVE INTO THEIR HOUSE,

45
00:02:49,776 --> 00:02:51,845
ASHLEY TREATS ME LIKE...

46
00:02:51,879 --> 00:02:54,515
LIKE DIRT? GUM STUCK ON HER SHOE?

47
00:02:54,548 --> 00:02:56,416
ALL OF THE ABOVE.

48
00:02:56,450 --> 00:02:59,586
SO, READY FOR DAY ONE AT THE REST OF OUR JUNIOR HIGH LIVES?

49
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:01,688
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

50
00:03:07,928 --> 00:03:09,830
DR. FREED SAYS WE NEED TO WORK TOGETHER

51
00:03:09,863 --> 00:03:12,266
AND TRY TO BE MORE LIKE SIBLINGS.

52
00:03:12,299 --> 00:03:13,767
YOU FIGHT ALL THE TIME,

53
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:16,270
CAN'T STAND THE SIGHT OF EACH OTHER,

54
00:03:16,303 --> 00:03:18,939
YOU'RE ALREADY ACTING LIKE SIBLINGS.

55
00:03:18,972 --> 00:03:20,374
I MEAN I DON'T MIND HIS DAD JEFF

56
00:03:20,407 --> 00:03:23,277
AND I'M GLAD MY MOM'S HAPPY BUT TOBY,

57
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:24,511
HE'S EVERYWHERE.

58
00:03:24,545 --> 00:03:28,382
HE'S LIKE A LITTLE MOSQUITO THAT KEEPS BUZZING IN YOUR EAR.

59
00:03:28,415 --> 00:03:29,516
HEY ASH,

60
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:31,318
MAYBE WHEN YOU'RE PRESIDENT YOU CAN GET HIM EXPELLED.

61
00:03:31,351 --> 00:03:32,753
YEAH, FOR MY LIFE.

62
00:03:32,786 --> 00:03:34,354
HEY GUYS.

63
00:03:34,388 --> 00:03:38,492
HAVEN'T SEEN YOU ALL SUMMER. HOW ARE YOU DOING?

64
00:03:38,525 --> 00:03:39,226
PAIGE?

65
00:03:39,927 --> 00:03:42,262
NEW YEAR, NEW LOOK, NEW PAIGE.

66
00:03:42,996 --> 00:03:44,898
YOU'RE PUTTING UP YOUR CAMPAIGN POSTERS ALREADY?

67
00:03:44,932 --> 00:03:46,633
THE ELECTION IS ON FRIDAY.

68
00:03:46,667 --> 00:03:48,569
WOW, YOU'D RATHER FOCUS ON THE ISSUES

69
00:03:48,602 --> 00:03:49,870
THAN ON YOUR APPEARANCE.

70
00:03:49,903 --> 00:03:51,572
THAT'S SO ADMIRABLE.

71
00:04:03,850 --> 00:04:05,919
MANNY, THERE'S NOTHING TO BE AFRAID OF.

72
00:04:05,953 --> 00:04:06,887
NOTHING BUT THE GRADE EIGHTS.

73
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:08,221
THEY'RE ONLY A YEAR OLDER THAN US.

74
00:04:08,255 --> 00:04:12,593
YEAH, A WHOLE YEAR TO THINK OF WAYS TO MAKE US SUFFER.

75
00:04:12,626 --> 00:04:13,460
HALL PASS.

76
00:04:14,628 --> 00:04:15,028
WHAT?

77
00:04:16,263 --> 00:04:19,499
YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED ON SCHOOL PROPERTY WITHOUT A HALL PASS.

78
00:04:19,533 --> 00:04:21,068
BUT WE DIDN'T GET ONE.

79
00:04:21,101 --> 00:04:23,503
THEN YOU BOTH HAVE TO LEAVE.

80
00:04:23,537 --> 00:04:27,808
BUT WE CAN'T, IT'S THE FIRST DAY OF SCHOOL.

81
00:04:28,942 --> 00:04:31,478
GRADE SEVENS ARE SUCH GEEKS.

82
00:04:40,454 --> 00:04:41,788
HEY GUYS.

83
00:04:45,592 --> 00:04:48,428
THAT'S OUR HOMEROOM? COOL.

84
00:04:51,665 --> 00:04:54,935
HEY GUYS, SORRY I'M LATE.

85
00:04:55,769 --> 00:04:56,436
HEY EMM.

86
00:04:57,571 --> 00:04:59,906
OKAY, HERE WE GO. ALL RIGHT,

87
00:05:01,541 --> 00:05:05,579
JUST CHOOSE YOUR OWN SEATS FOR THE TIME BEING.

88
00:05:12,819 --> 00:05:16,456
OKAY, WELCOME TO DEGRASSI COMMUNITY SCHOOL.

89
00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:17,491
I'M MR. SIMPSON.

90
00:05:17,524 --> 00:05:19,993
I'M YOUR HOMEROOM AND MEDIA IMMERSION TEACHER

91
00:05:20,027 --> 00:05:22,462
AND I GOT TO SAY YOU GUYS REALLY LUCKED OUT.

92
00:05:22,496 --> 00:05:23,664
I MEAN IT.

93
00:05:23,697 --> 00:05:28,101
THIS IS BY FAR THE COOLEST HOMEROOM IN THE ENTIRE SCHOOL.

94
00:05:28,135 --> 00:05:29,770
FIRST ORDER OF BUSINESS,

95
00:05:29,803 --> 00:05:32,806
THESE ARE THE CODE OF CONDUCT FORMS,

96
00:05:33,707 --> 00:05:36,610
CONCERNING THE COMPUTERS AND THE INTERNET.

97
00:05:36,643 --> 00:05:37,477
ALL RIGHT.

98
00:05:38,345 --> 00:05:39,146
I WANT TO GET THIS OUT OF THE WAY

99
00:05:39,179 --> 00:05:41,748
BEFORE WE GET TO KNOW ONE ANOTHER.

100
00:05:44,051 --> 00:05:46,453
SOME OF YOU I KNOW ALREADY

101
00:05:46,486 --> 00:05:50,123
AND A FEW OF YOU ARE NEW FACES ALL TOGETHER.

102
00:05:50,157 --> 00:05:51,358
WELCOME.

103
00:05:52,693 --> 00:05:54,628
GAVIN REGINALD MASON.

104
00:05:56,530 --> 00:05:58,465
I PREFER SPINNER.

105
00:05:59,466 --> 00:06:00,701
THIS YEAR, AM I GOING TO HAVE TO GIVE YOU,

106
00:06:00,734 --> 00:06:03,670
WHAT WAS IT, ANOTHER 14 DETENTIONS.

107
00:06:03,704 --> 00:06:06,640
NOT IF YOU DON'T WANT TO.

108
00:06:08,508 --> 00:06:09,943
OKAY. LEARNING AND GOOD GRADES

109
00:06:09,976 --> 00:06:12,446
ARE ALL VERY IMPORTANT HERE AT DEGRASSI.

110
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:15,482
BUT SO IS GETTING INVOLVED IN THE SCHOOL.

111
00:06:15,515 --> 00:06:17,684
THAT'S WHY I'M STARTING A SPIRIT SQUAD THIS MISS KWAN.

112
00:06:17,718 --> 00:06:19,419
WE SO NEED ONE.

113
00:06:19,453 --> 00:06:22,622
GREAT PAIGE. THAT'S SO INDUSTRIOUS OF YOU.

114
00:06:22,656 --> 00:06:25,525
AND SPEAKING OF INDUSTRIOUS, ASHLEY.

115
00:06:25,559 --> 00:06:25,692
YES?

116
00:06:26,493 --> 00:06:27,594
YOUR FIRST DAY OF SCHOOL

117
00:06:27,627 --> 00:06:30,464
AND YOU ALREADY HAVE A PROFESSIONAL CAMPAIGN UNDERWAY.

118
00:06:30,497 --> 00:06:31,765
EXCELLENT START.

119
00:06:31,798 --> 00:06:32,632
THANK YOU.

120
00:06:34,568 --> 00:06:37,504
STUDENTS ARE REMINDED THAT 3:15 TODAY

121
00:06:37,537 --> 00:06:40,173
IS THE DEADLINE FOR STUDENT COUNCIL NOMINATIONS.

122
00:06:40,207 --> 00:06:42,209
SEE MANNY, THIS ISN'T SO BAD, IS IT?

123
00:06:42,242 --> 00:06:46,947
AS LONG AS WE DON'T RUN INTO THAT JERK AGAIN.

124
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:48,648
IS THAT YOUR STEPSISTER?

125
00:06:48,682 --> 00:06:51,084
SHE'S NOT MY STEPSISTER.

126
00:06:51,118 --> 00:06:54,488
WE JUST HAPPEN TO BE STUCK IN A FORCED LIVING ARRANGEMENT.

127
00:06:54,521 --> 00:06:56,590
WELL I THINK SHE'S PRETTY.

128
00:06:56,623 --> 00:06:58,792
ASHLEY HATES THAT I LIVE IN HER HOUSE.

129
00:06:58,825 --> 00:07:00,861
AND SHE HATES THAT I GO TO HER SCHOOL.

130
00:07:00,894 --> 00:07:03,597
WHICH HAS OBVIOUSLY NEVER HEARD OF DEMOCRACY.

131
00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:04,631
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

132
00:07:04,664 --> 00:07:05,799
THIS ELECTION.

133
00:07:05,832 --> 00:07:07,134
NO ONE'S EVEN RUNNING AGAINST HER.

134
00:07:07,167 --> 00:07:08,602
SHE'S A SHOE IN.

135
00:07:08,635 --> 00:07:09,569
WHY DON'T YOU RUN?

136
00:07:09,603 --> 00:07:12,506
BECAUSE IT WOULD PROVOKE A RUPTURE

137
00:07:12,539 --> 00:07:14,841
IN OUR FRAGILE FAMILY DYNAMIC.

138
00:07:15,909 --> 00:07:19,179
IT'S FAMILY COUNSELING SPEAK BUT MY DAD WOULD KILL ME.

139
00:07:19,212 --> 00:07:20,447
SO GET SOMEONE ELSE TO RUN.

140
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:22,983
YEAH RIGHT. WHO'D WANT TO RUN FOR STUDENT COUNCIL?

141
00:07:23,016 --> 00:07:25,085
THE WHOLE THING'S A JOKE.

142
00:07:25,552 --> 00:07:27,554
DID YOU SAY JOKE?

143
00:07:28,622 --> 00:07:30,824
NO WAY TOBY, I'M NOT DOING A JOKE CAMPAIGN.

144
00:07:30,857 --> 00:07:31,825
OH COME ON J.T.,

145
00:07:31,858 --> 00:07:34,227
IT'S THE PERFECT WAY TO STICK IT TO ASHLEY.

146
00:07:34,261 --> 00:07:36,263
BUT THIS IS MY FIRST DAY AT DEGRASSI.

147
00:07:36,296 --> 00:07:37,264
EXACTLY.

148
00:07:37,297 --> 00:07:38,932
YOU'RE IN THE SAME BOAT AS A LARGE PERCENTAGE

149
00:07:38,965 --> 00:07:40,133
OF THE STUDENT BODY.

150
00:07:40,167 --> 00:07:42,769
WHICH IS WHY THEY'LL LOVE YOU.

151
00:07:42,803 --> 00:07:45,739
COME ON J.T. THIS IS A ONCE-IN A-LIFETIME OPPORTUNITY.

152
00:07:45,772 --> 00:07:47,240
FOR YOU TO STICK IT TO ASHLEY.

153
00:07:47,274 --> 00:07:49,843
NO, FOR YOU TO PRACTICE YOUR STAND-UP MATERIAL

154
00:07:49,876 --> 00:07:52,112
ON A LARGE RECEPTIVE AUDIENCE.

155
00:07:52,145 --> 00:07:53,246
KEEP TALKING.

156
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:54,648
YOU WANT TO BE FAMOUS, RIGHT?

157
00:07:54,681 --> 00:07:56,583
THIS IS INSTANT FAME.

158
00:07:56,616 --> 00:07:58,685
JUST THINK, ASSEMBLY,

159
00:07:58,718 --> 00:08:02,656
THE WHOLE SCHOOL HANGING ON YOUR EVERY WORD.

160
00:08:02,689 --> 00:08:05,525
AND YOU'LL DO ALL THE WORK.

161
00:08:06,259 --> 00:08:06,660
DEAL.

162
00:08:10,130 --> 00:08:12,599
HERE WE ARE, RIGHT HERE.

163
00:08:12,632 --> 00:08:13,934
WHAT IF I WIN?

164
00:08:13,967 --> 00:08:17,270
TRUST ME, YOU DON'T STAND A CHANCE.

165
00:08:18,071 --> 00:08:20,307
THE POSTER'S A LITTLE LOW ON THE LEFT.

166
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:21,942
ASHLEY KERWIN, WE HAVEN'T MET.

167
00:08:21,975 --> 00:08:24,978
I'M LIBERTY VAN ZANDT AND I'M RUNNING FOR SECRETARY.

168
00:08:25,011 --> 00:08:26,313
WE'RE GOING TO BE A GREAT TEAM.

169
00:08:26,346 --> 00:08:29,216
JUST THINK, I'D LIKE TO DISCUSS A FEW IDEAS

170
00:08:29,249 --> 00:08:31,084
SO OUR POLICIES WILL BE IN SYNC.

171
00:08:31,117 --> 00:08:34,588
FIRST, I THINK WE SHOULD TACKLE A LACK OF A SCHOOL NEWSPAPER.

172
00:08:34,621 --> 00:08:36,656
WHY DON'T WE WAIT 'TIL AFTER THE ELECTION?

173
00:08:36,690 --> 00:08:38,558
GREAT.

174
00:08:38,592 --> 00:08:41,795
YOUR POSTER IS A LITTLE HIGH ON THE LEFT.

175
00:08:44,965 --> 00:08:47,634
WHAT WAS THAT ALL ABOUT?

176
00:09:05,151 --> 00:09:09,089
YOU DO KNOW ITS TEN CENTS A COPY?

177
00:09:11,892 --> 00:09:14,060
I'M GOING TO MAKE SO MANY CHANGES AT THIS SCHOOL TERRI

178
00:09:14,094 --> 00:09:15,762
AND THAT'S JUST THE SUPERFICIAL STUFF.

179
00:09:15,795 --> 00:09:18,598
I WANT THE STUDENTS TO FEEL HEARD.

180
00:09:18,632 --> 00:09:19,766
UH, ASH.

181
00:09:19,799 --> 00:09:21,201
WHAT IS THAT?

182
00:09:22,702 --> 00:09:25,238
OH, A POSTER WITHOUT YOUR PICTURE ON IT.

183
00:09:25,272 --> 00:09:28,642
J.T. YORKE, THAT ANNOYING LITTLE FRIEND OF YOURS.

184
00:09:28,675 --> 00:09:30,143
WHAT'S WRONG ASHLEY?

185
00:09:30,176 --> 00:09:32,312
AFRAID OF A LITTLE COMPETITION?

186
00:09:32,345 --> 00:09:34,014
YOU ARE SO WASTING YOUR TIME.

187
00:09:34,047 --> 00:09:38,018
SCHOOL PRESIDENT IS ALWAYS IN EIGHTH GRADE.

188
00:09:38,051 --> 00:09:41,788
WELL THIS YEAR THAT'S GOING TO CHANGE.

189
00:09:43,890 --> 00:09:44,824
BYE ASHLEY.

190
00:09:46,159 --> 00:09:48,328
HEY J.T., WHY DO YOU WANT TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT?

191
00:09:48,361 --> 00:09:50,897
WHY DO I WANT TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT?

192
00:09:50,931 --> 00:09:51,765
THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION.

193
00:09:51,798 --> 00:09:54,067
IN ONE WORD, PEOPLE, DEMOCRACY.

194
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:55,902
THE BACKBONE OF OUR FINE NATION.

195
00:09:55,936 --> 00:09:57,270
HERE, HERE.

196
00:09:57,304 --> 00:09:59,406
HE IS PEOPLE, OUR GREAT ALTERNATIVE.

197
00:09:59,439 --> 00:10:02,275
IN A WORLD DOMINATED BY CRUEL, SELFISH EIGHTH GRADERS,

198
00:10:02,309 --> 00:10:04,711
J.T. IS OUR LAST SHINING HOPE.

199
00:10:04,744 --> 00:10:08,214
I COULDN'T HAVE SAID IT BETTER MYSELF. THANK YOU DEGRASSI.

200
00:10:08,248 --> 00:10:10,350
A GRADE SEVEN RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT.

201
00:10:10,383 --> 00:10:12,285
I WOULDN'T BE CAUGHT DEAD VOTING FOR HIM.

202
00:10:12,319 --> 00:10:16,423
BESIDES, I THINK ASHLEY AND I, LIBERTY VAN ZANDT,

203
00:10:16,456 --> 00:10:18,358
WILL MAKE AN EXCELLENT TEAM.

204
00:10:18,391 --> 00:10:20,961
IF ELECTED, I, J.T. YORKE,

205
00:10:20,994 --> 00:10:25,999
WILL DO WHAT A REAL POLITICIAN WOULD DO. ABSOLUTELY NOTHING.

206
00:10:26,032 --> 00:10:30,337
AND LIKE A TRUE POLITICIAN, I WILL ACCEPT BRIBES.

207
00:10:30,370 --> 00:10:32,672
PEOPLE ARE ACTUALLY PAYING ATTENTION TO HIM.

208
00:10:32,706 --> 00:10:38,345
HE'S PRETTY FUNNY. IF YOU LIKE TOTALLY IMMATURE HUMOUR.

209
00:10:38,378 --> 00:10:40,413
YOU'RE NOT ACTUALLY WORRIED ARE YOU?

210
00:10:40,447 --> 00:10:41,648
NO.

211
00:10:42,682 --> 00:10:46,086
I, J.T. YORKE, UNKNOWN, UNREMARKABLE...

212
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:49,789
OH PERSONALLY I THINK IT'S GREAT.

213
00:10:49,823 --> 00:10:51,024
GRADE SEVENS HAVE JUST AS MUCH RIGHT

214
00:10:51,057 --> 00:10:55,128
TO RUN FOR SCHOOL PRESIDENT AS ANYONE. I'M VOTING FOR J.T.

215
00:10:55,161 --> 00:10:57,364
GREAT REPRESENTATION ON THE SCHOOL BOARD.

216
00:10:57,397 --> 00:10:59,833
UPGRADED RECYCLING PROGRAM.

217
00:10:59,866 --> 00:11:02,936
I'LL EVEN GET US A NIGHT DANCE. ALL IT COSTS IS A VOTE.

218
00:11:02,969 --> 00:11:05,372
WHAT ABOUT THE STAFF WASHROOMS?

219
00:11:05,405 --> 00:11:06,873
I'LL BET YOU ANY MONEY

220
00:11:06,906 --> 00:11:10,210
THAT THEY HAVE SOFTER TOILET PAPER THAN US.

221
00:11:10,243 --> 00:11:14,047
IF YOU ELECT ME, I'LL MAKE THOSE STAFF WASHROOMS

222
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:15,248
OUR WASHROOMS.

223
00:11:16,182 --> 00:11:18,985
SO VOTE FOR J.T. YOU'LL DO THE RIGHT THING.

224
00:11:19,019 --> 00:11:20,353
I KNOW YOU WILL.

225
00:11:21,321 --> 00:11:22,455
IT'S WORKING.

226
00:11:22,489 --> 00:11:23,456
I KNOW.

227
00:11:24,457 --> 00:11:27,794
VOTE FOR J.T., IT WILL DO YOU GOOD.

228
00:11:27,827 --> 00:11:29,195
YOU'LL LOVE ME.

229
00:11:29,229 --> 00:11:30,430
NICE TO MEET YOU.

230
00:11:31,431 --> 00:11:33,333
TOBY ISAACS, YOU SHRIMP,

231
00:11:33,366 --> 00:11:35,301
WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS TO ME?

232
00:11:35,335 --> 00:11:37,404
I'M NOT DOING ANYTHING.

233
00:11:37,437 --> 00:11:41,007
J.T.WANTS TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT, SO I'M HELPING HIM OUT.

234
00:11:41,041 --> 00:11:44,144
J.T. DOESN'T CARE ABOUT THE SCHOOL.

235
00:11:44,177 --> 00:11:45,245
HOW DO YOU KNOW? GUESS WHAT?

236
00:11:45,278 --> 00:11:49,516
DEGRASSI DOESN'T REVOLVE AROUND YOU. ANYONE CAN RUN.

237
00:11:49,549 --> 00:11:52,018
THE GUY IS AN IDIOT AND HE DOESN'T KNOW ANYTHING

238
00:11:52,052 --> 00:11:53,386
'CAUSE HE JUST GOT THERE.

239
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:55,288
ASHLEY, WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?

240
00:11:55,321 --> 00:11:57,090
OH GREAT, TAKE HIS SIDE AGAIN.

241
00:11:57,123 --> 00:11:59,092
DON'T EVEN TRY TO FIGURE OUT WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT.

242
00:11:59,125 --> 00:12:01,394
I MEAN I PUT ALL MY EFFORT INTO THIS RACE.

243
00:12:01,428 --> 00:12:05,231
THERE WAS NO RACE. NOW THERE IS.

244
00:12:05,265 --> 00:12:07,801
TOBY ARE YOU RUNNING AGAINST ASHLEY?

245
00:12:07,834 --> 00:12:10,203
NO, HIS FRIEND J.T. IS.

246
00:12:10,236 --> 00:12:12,138
I'M HELPING MY BEST FRIEND RUN HIS CAMPAIGN.

247
00:12:12,172 --> 00:12:13,306
WHAT'S WRONG WITH THAT?

248
00:12:13,339 --> 00:12:16,176
WHAT'S WRONG IS HE'S ONLY DOING IT TO BUG ME.

249
00:12:16,209 --> 00:12:19,145
COME ON ASHLEY, I'M SURE HE'S NOT.

250
00:12:19,179 --> 00:12:20,380
BUT MOM.

251
00:12:20,413 --> 00:12:24,784
TOBY HAS EVERY RIGHT TO HELP RUN HIS BEST FRIEND'S CAMPAIGN.

252
00:12:31,191 --> 00:12:32,792
TODAY'S THE BIG DAY.

253
00:12:32,826 --> 00:12:34,494
WRITTEN YOUR DEFEAT SPEECH YET?

254
00:12:34,527 --> 00:12:36,963
J.T. IS NOT GOING TO WIN.

255
00:12:36,996 --> 00:12:38,131
YOU WISH.

256
00:12:38,164 --> 00:12:42,869
JUST THINK, YOU'RE ABOUT TO LOSE TO A SEVENTH GRADER.

257
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:55,281
HI, MY NAME IS PAIGE.

258
00:12:55,315 --> 00:12:57,383
AND OF COURSE ASHLEY'S GOING TO WIN TODAY.

259
00:12:57,417 --> 00:13:00,053
SURE, SOME STUDENTS MAY RESENT HER FOR BEING SO PERFECT

260
00:13:00,086 --> 00:13:02,055
BUT ASHLEY ALWAYS GETS WHAT SHE WANTS

261
00:13:02,088 --> 00:13:04,324
SO WHY SHOULD TODAY BE ANY DIFFERENT.

262
00:13:04,357 --> 00:13:06,392
ACTUALLY, I'LL TELL YOU WHY TODAY'S DIFFERENT.

263
00:13:06,426 --> 00:13:08,128
SEE, I JUST GOT THESE BRAND NEW GLASSES

264
00:13:08,161 --> 00:13:10,430
AND I THINK THEY LOOK RATHER NICE WITH MY OUTFIT,

265
00:13:10,463 --> 00:13:13,333
DON'T' YOU? OH AND MY BELT, PLEASE DO A CLOSE UP OF MY BELT

266
00:13:13,366 --> 00:13:14,434
THANKS, BEAUTIFUL EH?

267
00:13:14,467 --> 00:13:17,871
AND MY NEW PURSE SO EVERYONE CAN SEE ALL THAT I OWN.

268
00:13:17,904 --> 00:13:19,339
WHAT DO I HAVE IN HERE?

269
00:13:19,372 --> 00:13:20,507
THIS ISN'T MINE.

270
00:13:23,176 --> 00:13:25,578
HELLO, I'M NOT DONE HERE!

271
00:13:29,182 --> 00:13:32,252
LOOK AT THIS. YOU'VE GOT AS MUCH SUPPORT AS ASHLEY.

272
00:13:32,285 --> 00:13:35,054
IT'S JUST SOME STUPID POLL.

273
00:13:35,088 --> 00:13:36,990
THIS IS BEFORE YOUR SPEECH.

274
00:13:37,023 --> 00:13:38,057
FORGET ASHLEY,

275
00:13:38,091 --> 00:13:41,427
YOU'RE ON THE VERGE OF MAKING DEGRASSI HISTORY.

276
00:13:42,195 --> 00:13:44,164
AM I THE ONLY ONE EXCITED HERE?

277
00:13:44,197 --> 00:13:46,399
I THOUGHT THE PLAN WAS TO MAKE HER SWEAT.

278
00:13:46,432 --> 00:13:49,102
EXACTLY. THE CLOSER YOU COME TO BEATING HER,

279
00:13:49,135 --> 00:13:51,337
THE SWEATIER SHE GETS.

280
00:13:51,371 --> 00:13:54,140
YEAH, WELL I'M GETTING PRETTY SWEATY TOO.

281
00:13:54,174 --> 00:13:56,142
BECAUSE IF I WIN THIS THING

282
00:13:56,176 --> 00:13:59,345
I'M GOING TO HAVE TO DO A LOT OF WORK.

283
00:14:01,681 --> 00:14:05,351
IT WOULD BE TRAGIC IF ASHLEY LOST TODAY

284
00:14:05,385 --> 00:14:08,955
BUT IF SHE DID AND IF I, LIBERTY VAN ZANDT,

285
00:14:08,988 --> 00:14:10,356
AM ELECTED AS SECRETARY,

286
00:14:10,390 --> 00:14:13,026
I WILL WORK CLOSELY WITH J.T. TO ENSURE

287
00:14:13,059 --> 00:14:16,362
EXCELLENT STANDARDS OF STUDENT GOVERNMENT.

288
00:14:22,302 --> 00:14:23,336
HI.

289
00:14:23,369 --> 00:14:24,437
YOU'RE COMING WITH US.

290
00:14:24,470 --> 00:14:28,241
WHAT? WHAT DID I DO? I'M LATE FOR CLASS.

291
00:14:28,274 --> 00:14:29,542
YOU'RE GOING TO BE LATE FOR CLASS.

292
00:14:29,576 --> 00:14:30,977
THAT'S A LOT OF LATENESS.

293
00:14:31,010 --> 00:14:32,645
YOU WANT TO GET A DETENTION?

294
00:14:32,679 --> 00:14:34,147
I KNOW I DON'T.

295
00:14:37,684 --> 00:14:39,419
...IF THERE'S SOMETHING YOU GOT A PROBLEM WITH

296
00:14:39,452 --> 00:14:42,322
JUST TELL ME AND I'LL CHANGE IT, REALLY I WILL.

297
00:14:42,355 --> 00:14:45,358
THANKS, THAT'S ALL FOR NOW.

298
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:48,027
WHAT'S GOING ON?

299
00:14:48,061 --> 00:14:48,928
HERE'S THE DEAL.

300
00:14:48,962 --> 00:14:50,496
YOU QUIT THE RACE FOR SCHOOL PRESIDENT

301
00:14:50,530 --> 00:14:52,599
AND I GIVE YOU $50 BUCKS.

302
00:14:53,666 --> 00:14:55,201
$50 BUCKS?

303
00:14:55,235 --> 00:14:55,635
FIVE O.

304
00:14:58,471 --> 00:14:59,405
OKAY,$60.

305
00:15:01,708 --> 00:15:03,243
YOU SEE I'D JUMP AT THAT

306
00:15:03,276 --> 00:15:05,211
BUT I'VE GOT THIS OLDER BROTHER,

307
00:15:05,245 --> 00:15:06,713
HE JUST LOST THE RACE FOR SCHOOL PRESIDENT.

308
00:15:06,746 --> 00:15:08,014
$65.

309
00:15:08,581 --> 00:15:10,049
MY PARENTS WERE SHATTERED.

310
00:15:10,083 --> 00:15:11,517
THEY HAD TO GO ON PROZAC.

311
00:15:11,551 --> 00:15:13,253
I CAN'T PUT THEM THROUGH THAT AGAIN.

312
00:15:13,286 --> 00:15:17,223
$80 BUCKS AND THAT'S MY FINAL OFFER.

313
00:15:17,257 --> 00:15:18,458
$80'S GOOD.

314
00:15:18,491 --> 00:15:20,059
GLAD TO HEAR IT.

315
00:15:20,093 --> 00:15:21,060
BUT FOR THAT AMOUNT,

316
00:15:21,094 --> 00:15:22,395
I WANT A SHOW.

317
00:15:22,428 --> 00:15:25,265
I WANT YOU TO QUIT IN FRONT OF WHOLE SCHOOL.

318
00:15:25,298 --> 00:15:26,566
AT ASSEMBLY.

319
00:15:26,599 --> 00:15:29,535
COOL. I STILL GET TO SAY MY SPEECH.

320
00:15:31,304 --> 00:15:34,140
HALF NOW, THE REST AFTER.

321
00:15:35,742 --> 00:15:38,177
IT WAS A PLEASURE DOING BUSINESS WITH YOU,

322
00:15:38,211 --> 00:15:39,379
MS. PRESIDENT.

323
00:15:41,547 --> 00:15:42,548
I'LL GO NOW.

324
00:15:52,392 --> 00:15:54,260
ONCE THE ELECTION'S OVER I HAVE TO HEAD STRAIGHT HOME.

325
00:15:54,294 --> 00:15:56,362
AND AVOID SPINNER.

326
00:15:57,664 --> 00:15:58,598
OW.

327
00:16:02,669 --> 00:16:04,570
OH GREAT NOW LOOK WHAT YOU'VE DONE.

328
00:16:04,604 --> 00:16:07,473
I WAS JUST KIDDING AROUND.

329
00:16:07,507 --> 00:16:13,212
WOW THAT'S SO COOL SPINNER, MAKING A GRADE SEVEN GIRL CRY.

330
00:16:14,647 --> 00:16:16,549
LOOK I DIDN'T MEAN TO MAKE HER CRY.

331
00:16:16,582 --> 00:16:19,652
WELL YOU DID, CONGRATULATIONS.

332
00:16:23,456 --> 00:16:25,725
IT'S OKAY MANNY, HE'S GONE.

333
00:16:28,728 --> 00:16:33,399
I KNEW IT WOULD WORK. ALWAYS DOES ON MY BROTHER.

334
00:16:37,170 --> 00:16:38,438
SHE BRIBED YOU.

335
00:16:38,471 --> 00:16:39,605
SHE PAID ME.

336
00:16:39,639 --> 00:16:40,673
IT'S WRONG.

337
00:16:40,707 --> 00:16:42,675
WRONG. HOW ABOUT THIS WHOLE CAMPAIGN?

338
00:16:42,709 --> 00:16:43,910
WHAT ABOUT IT?

339
00:16:43,943 --> 00:16:46,379
WE DID THIS JUST TO GET BACK AT YOUR STEPSISTER.

340
00:16:46,412 --> 00:16:48,414
SHE'S NOT MY STEPSISTER.

341
00:16:48,448 --> 00:16:51,517
WOULD ALL CANDIDATES PLEASE COME ON THE STAGE?

342
00:16:51,551 --> 00:16:55,722
LOOK IF IT MAKES YOU FEEL ANY BETTER, WE'LL SPLIT IT. 50-50.

343
00:16:55,755 --> 00:16:57,490
I DON'T WANT HER BLOOD MONEY.

344
00:16:57,523 --> 00:17:02,462
IT'S JUST HELPING ASHLEY GET EXACTLY WHAT SHE WANTS, AGAIN.

345
00:17:06,632 --> 00:17:11,337
IN CONCLUSION, I PROMISE THAT IF ELECTED I, LIBERTY VAN ZANDT

346
00:17:11,371 --> 00:17:13,406
WILL FULFILL MY RESPONSIBILITIES

347
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:17,343
AS STUDENT COUNCIL SECRETARY WITH ENTHUSIASM

348
00:17:17,377 --> 00:17:19,412
AND EVEN MORE ENTHUSIASM.

349
00:17:19,445 --> 00:17:20,480
THANK YOU.

350
00:17:24,784 --> 00:17:28,354
THANK YOU VERY MUCH LIBERTY FOR THAT ENTHUSIASM.

351
00:17:28,388 --> 00:17:30,857
NEXT UP, OUR TWO CANDIDATES FOR SCHOOL PRESIDENT.

352
00:17:30,890 --> 00:17:33,226
EACH WILL HAVE THREE MINUTES TO DELIVER THEIR SPEECHES

353
00:17:33,259 --> 00:17:36,095
AND WE WILL BEGIN WITH J.T. YORKE.

354
00:17:39,465 --> 00:17:40,633
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.

355
00:17:40,666 --> 00:17:43,503
IT'S A LONG YEAR. YOU'VE GOT TO VOTE FOR ME.

356
00:17:43,536 --> 00:17:47,140
YOU NEED SOMETHING TO LAUGH AT.

357
00:17:47,173 --> 00:17:48,107
ASHLEY

358
00:17:48,141 --> 00:17:49,442
NOW IF I COULD JUST A SAY A FEW WORDS

359
00:17:49,475 --> 00:17:50,710
ABOUT MY PRESIDENTIAL PLATFORM,

360
00:17:50,743 --> 00:17:52,545
THIS SPEECH WOULD BE A WHOLE LOT SHORTER.

361
00:17:52,578 --> 00:17:53,746
BUT SERIOUSLY,

362
00:17:54,947 --> 00:17:57,383
IF THERE'S ONE THING THAT I'VE LEARNED IN MY ZERO YEARS

363
00:17:57,417 --> 00:18:01,721
OF POLITICAL EXPERIENCE, IT'S, WELL IT'S NOTHING.

364
00:18:01,754 --> 00:18:03,322
WHAT ARE THE ISSUES FACING TODAY'S...

365
00:18:03,356 --> 00:18:04,157
WHAT?

366
00:18:04,190 --> 00:18:05,858
YOU BRIBED J.T.

367
00:18:05,892 --> 00:18:07,093
NO I DIDN'T.

368
00:18:07,126 --> 00:18:09,495
YES YOU DID. I SAW THE MONEY. THAT'S CORRUPTION.

369
00:18:09,529 --> 00:18:11,597
OH HOW THRILLING, YOU LEARNED A NEW WORD.

370
00:18:11,631 --> 00:18:12,832
OH YOU WANT THRILLING?

371
00:18:12,865 --> 00:18:16,769
WAIT 'TIL I GO UP ON STAGE AND TELL EVERYONE WHAT YOU DID.

372
00:18:16,803 --> 00:18:18,304
BUT J.T. TOOK THE MONEY.

373
00:18:18,337 --> 00:18:21,174
NO, HE ACCEPTED IT AS EVIDENCE.

374
00:18:21,207 --> 00:18:22,275
YOU WOULDN'T.

375
00:18:22,308 --> 00:18:24,343
I WILL. I'M HEADING UP THERE

376
00:18:24,377 --> 00:18:28,314
AND TELLING EVERYONE WHAT A FRAUD ASHLEY KERWIN IS.

377
00:18:28,347 --> 00:18:30,917
FINE. MY LIFE'S A DISASTER ANYWAY.

378
00:18:30,950 --> 00:18:32,518
IT MIGHT AS WELL GET WORSE.

379
00:18:32,552 --> 00:18:35,221
YOUR LIFE'S A DISASTER.

380
00:18:35,254 --> 00:18:38,324
I WANT MY MOM TO BE HAPPY AND I'VE TRIED TO BE NICE

381
00:18:38,357 --> 00:18:39,525
BUT THE MOMENT YOU MOVED IN

382
00:18:39,559 --> 00:18:41,327
EVERYTHING BECAME ALL ABOUT YOU.

383
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:42,695
ABOUT ME. DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA

384
00:18:42,728 --> 00:18:44,597
WHAT IT'S LIKE LIVING IN YOUR HOUSE?

385
00:18:44,630 --> 00:18:47,333
PLEASE, MY MOM DOTES ON YOU.

386
00:18:47,366 --> 00:18:50,403
SHE DOESN'T CARE WHAT I FEEL SO LONG AS YOU'RE HAPPY.

387
00:18:50,436 --> 00:18:51,404
WHAT?

388
00:18:51,437 --> 00:18:52,638
AND NOW I CAN'T GET AWAY FROM YOU.

389
00:18:52,672 --> 00:18:56,943
YOU'RE EVERYWHERE, AT HOME, AT SCHOOL, EVEN IN MY CAMPAIGN.

390
00:18:56,976 --> 00:18:58,444
THAT'S NOT TRUE.

391
00:18:58,478 --> 00:18:59,278
I WANTED JUST ONE THING

392
00:18:59,312 --> 00:19:01,481
THAT YOU COULDN'T TAKE AWAY FROM ME.

393
00:19:01,514 --> 00:19:03,382
BUT YOU FOUND A WAY.

394
00:19:07,453 --> 00:19:11,557
PLEASE, BEFORE YOU GO UP THERE AND PUBLICLY HUMILIATE ME,

395
00:19:11,591 --> 00:19:14,293
JUST LISTEN TO MY SPEECH.

396
00:19:14,327 --> 00:19:18,865
THEN DECIDE IF YOU DON'T THINK I DESERVE TO BE PRESIDENT.

397
00:19:19,599 --> 00:19:21,501
SHE'S GOT THE LOOKS, SHE'S GOT THE BRAINS,

398
00:19:21,534 --> 00:19:22,835
SHE'S GOT EVERYTHING.

399
00:19:22,869 --> 00:19:25,805
DON'T PITY HER, PITY ME. THANK YOU.

400
00:19:29,509 --> 00:19:34,380
OH, BY THE WAY, I QUIT THE RACE FOR SCHOOL PREZ. VOTE ASHLEY.

401
00:19:35,581 --> 00:19:37,717
WELL THAT'S RATHER UN-EXPECTED.

402
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:39,619
J.T., ARE YOU SURE?

403
00:19:39,652 --> 00:19:41,354
UH, HUH.

404
00:19:41,387 --> 00:19:44,390
I THINK WE WOULD STILL LIKE TO HEAR WHAT ASHLEY HAS TO SAY.

405
00:19:44,423 --> 00:19:45,491
ASHLEY. ASHLEY.

406
00:19:48,861 --> 00:19:50,463
WE'LL TALK LATER.

407
00:19:54,467 --> 00:19:55,601
PLEASE.

408
00:20:03,910 --> 00:20:04,877
NO WAY.

409
00:20:04,911 --> 00:20:06,412
YEAH, WELL WHATEVER, I'M NOT LYING.

410
00:20:06,445 --> 00:20:07,980
YEAH, RIGHT.

411
00:20:09,482 --> 00:20:12,652
WELL THANKS AND I'LL SEE YOU TOMORROW.

412
00:20:13,853 --> 00:20:17,323
CONGRATULATIONS MISS PRESIDENT.

413
00:20:23,996 --> 00:20:27,934
SO IS THIS WHAT DEFEAT LOOKS LIKE OR JUST GUILT.

414
00:20:27,967 --> 00:20:29,969
CONGRATULATIONS ASHLEY.

415
00:20:30,002 --> 00:20:31,871
YEAH, WHATEVER.

416
00:20:31,904 --> 00:20:34,473
I MEAN IT. CONGRATULATIONS.

417
00:20:34,507 --> 00:20:35,975
YOU DESERVED TO WIN.

418
00:20:39,345 --> 00:20:43,683
OKAY, WHAT HAVE YOU DONE WITH THE REAL TOBY ISAACS?

419
00:20:43,716 --> 00:20:44,817
IT'S MY FAULT J.T.'S IN TROUBLE

420
00:20:44,850 --> 00:20:47,353
FOR RUNNING THE JOKE CAMPAIGN.

421
00:20:47,386 --> 00:20:48,754
I SHOULDN'T HAVE PUT HIM UP TO IT.

422
00:20:48,788 --> 00:20:50,590
YOU'RE RIGHT, YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE.

423
00:20:50,623 --> 00:20:53,960
ASH, I'M TRYING TO APOLOGIZE HERE.

424
00:20:53,993 --> 00:20:55,895
I KNEW IT WOULD DRIVE YOU CRAZY.

425
00:20:55,928 --> 00:20:58,297
I JUST COULDN'T STOP MYSELF.

426
00:20:58,331 --> 00:20:59,699
YOU HATE ME THAT MUCH.

427
00:20:59,732 --> 00:21:01,334
SOMETIMES.

428
00:21:02,702 --> 00:21:05,504
I GOT TO ADMIT, SOMETIMES I FEEL THE SAME WAY ABOUT YOU.

429
00:21:05,538 --> 00:21:08,040
THE FACT IS TOBY WE HAVE TO LIVE WITH EACH OTHER

430
00:21:08,074 --> 00:21:10,710
IN THE SAME HOUSE AND THAT SUCKS, RIGHT.

431
00:21:10,743 --> 00:21:12,411
YOU CAN SAY THAT AGAIN.

432
00:21:12,445 --> 00:21:15,815
BUT DOES IT HAVE TO SUCK THIS MUCH?

433
00:21:15,848 --> 00:21:17,016
MAYBE NOT.

434
00:21:17,049 --> 00:21:18,651
MAYBE NOT.

435
00:21:19,051 --> 00:21:20,953
ARE WE BONDING HERE?

436
00:21:20,987 --> 00:21:22,688
Toby BONDING. US.

437
00:21:24,023 --> 00:21:25,524
WELL FOR THE FIRST TIME IN A MONTH,

438
00:21:25,558 --> 00:21:28,394
I DON'T WANT TO RIP YOUR EYES OUT.

439
00:21:28,894 --> 00:21:32,298
WOW, DR. FREED WOULD BE SO PROUD.
