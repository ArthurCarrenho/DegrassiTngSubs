SCHOOL TRIP - IT'S SUMMER.

7
00:00:16,357 --> 00:00:17,424
YOU HACKED MY EMAIL?

8
00:00:17,458 --> 00:00:19,360
HAVEN'T YOU EVER HEARD OF PRIVACY.

9
00:00:19,393 --> 00:00:22,296
RELAX, I COULDN'T HACK MY WAY OUT OF A PAPER BAG,

10
00:00:22,329 --> 00:00:25,332

MOM, YOU'RE GOING TO BE SO LATE.

28
00:01:28,328 --> 00:01:30,564
TOO LATE. I AM LATE.

29
00:01:30,597 --> 00:01:33,233
WOW. YOU LOOK INCREDIBLE.

30
00:01:33,267 --> 00:01:34,401
ARE YOU SURE?

31
00:01:34,435 --> 00:01:36,703
SERIOUSLY. IT'S KIND OF SCARY.

32
00:01:36,737 --> 00:01:40,207
I FEEL LIKE I'M GOING TO THE PROM I NEVER GOT TO GO TO.

33
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:42,543
OH, THAT SOUNDS SO LAME.

34
00:01:46,447 --> 00:01:48,382
YOU REALLY WANT ME OUT OF HERE, DON'T YOU?

35
00:01:48,415 --> 00:01:50,184
IS THERE SOMETHING YOU'RE NOT TELLING ME?

36
00:01:50,217 --> 00:01:52,920
YEAH. MANNY AND I ARE GOING TO WATCH TV ALL NIGHT.

37
00:01:52,953 --> 00:01:56,523
AND WE MIGHT EVEN EAT POPCORN - WITH REAL BUTTER.

38
00:01:56,557 --> 00:01:57,658
VERY SHOCKING.

39
00:01:57,691 --> 00:01:59,493
OKAY, SMART MOUTH.

40
00:01:59,526 --> 00:02:01,328

00:02:05,599 --> 00:02:06,133
BYE.

42
00:02:22,649 --> 00:02:23,350
HEY.

43
00:02:23,383 --> 00:02:25,252
HOW'S IT GOING? WELCOME.

44
00:02:25,285 --> 00:02:26,520

00:02:42,102 --> 00:02:43,337
THE MEDIA IMMERSION PROGRAM IS VERY UNIQUE TO OUR SCHOOL.

54
00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:49,309
WE HAVE OVER FIFTY HIGH SPEED COMPUTERS WITH INTERNET ACCESS

55
00:02:49,343 --> 00:02:50,744
AND OTHER EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES.

56
00:02:50,777 --> 00:02:54,948
WE ALSO HAVE THE MOST UP TO DATE MEDIA ARTS...

57
00:03:02,556 --> 00:03:04,858
SO HAVE YOU MADE UP YOUR MIND?

58
00:03:04,892 --> 00:03:06,560
YEAH. I'M NOT GOING.

59
00:03:07,494 --> 00:03:09,663
REALLY? I'M SO RELIEVED.

60
00:03:09,696 --> 00:03:12,332
YEAH. MAYBE I'LL MEET HIM WHEN I'M OLDER EH?

61
00:03:12,366 --> 00:03:15,536
HEY ABSOLUTELY. WANT ME TO COME OVER?

62
00:03:15,569 --> 00:03:17,304

AND I REALLY WANT TO WATCH IT.

65
00:03:20,607 --> 00:03:21,909
YOU KNOW, FOR JORDAN.

66
00:03:21,942 --> 00:03:23,977
I COULD HELP YOU RESEARCH.

67
00:03:24,011 --> 00:03:26,847
AH, IT'S OKAY. I REALLY NEED TO CONCENTRATE.

68
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:27,548
OH. OKAY.

69
00:03:27,581 --> 00:03:28,248
IT'S ABOUT TO START.

70
00:03:28,282 --> 00:03:30,951
SO I'LL CALL YOU TOMORROW OKAY?

71
00:03:30,984 --> 00:03:31,652
OKAY.

72
00:03:31,685 --> 00:03:33,287

00:03:36,657 --> 00:03:38,325
OUR GEOGRAPHY ROOM TO THE LEFT.

75
00:03:38,358 --> 00:03:41,028
AND THE ENGLISH DEPARTMENT UP AHEAD.

76
00:03:41,061 --> 00:03:43,664
I'M REALLY SORRY ABOUT LAST NIGHT.

77
00:03:43,697 --> 00:03:45,599
IT WASN'T THE WAY I'D PICTURED SEEING YOU AGAIN

78
00:03:45,632 --> 00:03:47,034
AFTER ALL THESE YEARS.

79
00:03:47,067 --> 00:03:49,336
ME NEITHER.

80
00:03:49,369 --> 00:03:51,004
CAN WE JUST SAY THAT THAT PAST IS THE PAST.

81
00:03:51,038 --> 00:03:54,675
AND THAT THE PRESENT IS NOW THE PAST.

82
00:03:54,708 --> 00:03:57,711
AND THAT THE FUTURE IS AH -

83
00:03:57,744 --> 00:03:59,613
I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING.

84
00:03:59,646 --> 00:04:01,315
I JUST - I'M TRYING TO SAY,

85
00:04:01,348 --> 00:04:04,351
I WANT US TO BE FRIENDS AGAIN. OKAY?

86
00:04:04,384 --> 00:04:05,052
ME TOO.

87
00:04:05,085 --> 00:04:06,620
GOOD.

88
00:04:06,653 --> 00:04:07,554
JOEY, STAY.

89
00:04:07,588 --> 00:04:08,655
AW-

90
00:04:08,689 --> 00:04:09,489
JUST HANG OUT. COME ON. NO PRESSURE.

91
00:04:09,523 --> 00:04:12,759
IT WON'T BE A REUNION WITHOUT YOU.

92
00:04:12,793 --> 00:04:16,797
OH MY GOD! CAITLIN RYAN, JOEY JEREMIAH.

93
00:04:18,098 --> 00:04:19,333
ALISON!

94
00:04:19,366 --> 00:04:20,500
HI.

95
00:04:20,534 --> 00:04:21,668
WOW. IT'S BEEN-

96
00:04:21,702 --> 00:04:23,770
AGES. BUT I SEE YOU EVERY WEEK ON THAT SHOW.

97
00:04:23,804 --> 00:04:26,607
WHAT'S IT CALLED? OH AND YOU, YOUR COMMERCIAL.

98
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:28,675
YEAH I KNOW. IT'S TOTALLY CHEESE.

99
00:04:28,709 --> 00:04:31,845
NO, JOEY, IT'S SEXY. THE WAY YOU RIP OFF YOUR SHIRT,

100
00:04:31,878 --> 00:04:33,747
IT ALMOST MADE ME WANT TO BUY A CAR.

101
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:35,315
OH YEAH?

102
00:04:35,349 --> 00:04:38,085
WELL, CAN I BUY YOU A DRINK INSTEAD?

103
00:04:38,118 --> 00:04:39,620
I THINK THEY'RE FREE.

104
00:04:39,653 --> 00:04:42,656
OH, COME ON. FOR OLD TIMES SAKE.

105
00:04:42,689 --> 00:04:44,558
I'LL CATCH UP TO YOU LATER.

106
00:04:44,591 --> 00:04:45,759
BYE.

107
00:05:07,147 --> 00:05:09,616
(Answering machine) PLEASE RECORD YOUR MESSAGE NOW.

108
00:05:09,650 --> 00:05:11,652
HI, JORDAN. THIS IS EMMA.

109
00:05:11,685 --> 00:05:12,853
I KNOW I'M A LITTLE EARLY

110
00:05:12,886 --> 00:05:14,955
SO I GUESS I'LL JUST WAIT DOWN HERE.

111
00:05:14,988 --> 00:05:18,659
BUT I'M WEARING - YOU KNOW WHAT I LOOK LIKE.

112
00:05:19,459 --> 00:05:21,928
OKAY. I GUESS I'LL SEE YOU SOON.

113
00:05:25,098 --> 00:05:27,701
TOBY, YOU HAVE A VISITOR.

114
00:05:29,403 --> 00:05:31,405
MANNY? WHAT'S UP?

115
00:05:34,141 --> 00:05:36,743
I'VE GOT A BAD FEELING.

116
00:05:40,747 --> 00:05:43,116
I WENT BY EMMA'S. NOT THERE.

117
00:05:43,150 --> 00:05:46,520
I TRIED HER CELL. DIDN'T PICK UP.

118
00:05:46,553 --> 00:05:47,387
SO?

119
00:05:48,355 --> 00:05:50,724
SO - SHE SAID SHE WAS STAYING HOME TONIGHT

120
00:05:50,757 --> 00:05:53,727
TO WATCH A SHOW ON WILDLIFE REFUGE. IT'S NOT ON.

121
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:54,795
I CHECKED.

122
00:05:55,962 --> 00:05:58,498
WELL SHE DIDN'T GO MEET THAT JORDAN GUY DID SHE?

123
00:05:58,532 --> 00:06:02,069
I HAVE NO IDEA. SHE WAS ACTING REALLY WEIRD.

124
00:06:02,102 --> 00:06:05,706
SO THIS GIRL FROM B.C., SHE MEETS THIS GUY ONLINE.

125
00:06:05,739 --> 00:06:08,809
THEY HIT IT OFF. SHE GOES TO MEET HIM.

126
00:06:08,842 --> 00:06:12,145
THREE DAYS LATER, THEY FIND HER DEAD - LIKE IN PIECES.

127
00:06:12,179 --> 00:06:13,580
THAT WAS SOME PSYCHO.

128
00:06:13,613 --> 00:06:14,815
EMMA IS WAY TOO SMART FOR THAT.

129
00:06:14,848 --> 00:06:16,950
SHE GETS LIKE PRACTICALLY STRAIGHT A'S.

130
00:06:16,983 --> 00:06:19,920
SO, THIS ISN'T SCHOOL.

131
00:06:21,588 --> 00:06:22,789
WHERE WOULD THEY GO?

132
00:06:22,823 --> 00:06:25,692
WELL WE CAN'T CALL HER. WE CAN'T READ HER E-MAIL.

133
00:06:25,726 --> 00:06:26,793
WHY NOT?

134
00:06:30,931 --> 00:06:32,799
YOU KNOW HER BETTER THEN ME, YOU WENT TO HIGH SCHOOL.

135
00:06:32,833 --> 00:06:37,671
IT'S JUST CATIE IS REALLY PUSHING THIS MARRIAGE THING.

136
00:06:37,704 --> 00:06:41,875
AND AH, I'M ABOUT TO HIT IT BIG, YOU KNOW, IN L.A.

137
00:06:41,908 --> 00:06:44,878
AND SO HER CAREER WOULD HAVE TO TAKE THE BACK SEAT.

138
00:06:44,911 --> 00:06:48,148
I DON'T THINK THAT'S FAIR - TO HER.

139
00:06:48,181 --> 00:06:49,950
I COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND.

140
00:06:49,983 --> 00:06:52,119
I MEAN YOU'RE AN ARTIST.

141
00:06:52,152 --> 00:06:55,989
YOU NEED TO BE FREE - OPEN TO NEW EXPERIENCES.

142
00:06:58,024 --> 00:06:59,126
I'LL HAVE TO COME VISIT YOU.

143
00:06:59,159 --> 00:07:01,061
THAT WOULD BE GREAT. I COULD TAKE YOU OUT,

144
00:07:01,094 --> 00:07:02,929
SHOW YOU AROUND.

145
00:07:10,837 --> 00:07:12,773
WAIT. YOU'RE NOT-

146
00:07:12,806 --> 00:07:15,008
YOU'RE NOT EMMA, ARE YOU?

147
00:07:15,041 --> 00:07:15,575
WHO ARE YOU?

148
00:07:15,609 --> 00:07:16,910
MY NAME IS MR. NYSTROM.

149
00:07:16,943 --> 00:07:19,546
I'M A TEACHER WITH THE SCHOOL TRIP.

150
00:07:19,579 --> 00:07:22,182
ONE OF MY STUDENTS IS SUPPOSED TO BE MEETING A GIRL.

151
00:07:22,215 --> 00:07:23,617
ARE YOU EMMA?

152
00:07:23,650 --> 00:07:24,651
YEAH.

153
00:07:25,685 --> 00:07:27,888
OH, GREAT. I'M JORDAN'S TEACHER.

154
00:07:27,921 --> 00:07:28,688
DON'T TELL HIM THAT I TOLD YOU THIS,

155
00:07:28,722 --> 00:07:30,824
BUT HE IS SO EXCITED TO MEET YOU.

156
00:07:30,857 --> 00:07:33,193
SO AM I. I MEAN TO MEET HIM.

157
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:34,594
WELL COME ON UP.

158
00:07:34,628 --> 00:07:37,230
WE'RE JUST ABOUT TO HAVE SOME DINNER.

159
00:07:37,264 --> 00:07:38,732
IF YOU'D RATHER WAIT HERE,

160
00:07:38,765 --> 00:07:40,834
I CAN SEND JORDAN DOWN AFTER HE EATS.

161
00:07:40,867 --> 00:07:43,503
BUT, HE DID WANT YOU TO SIGN HIS PETITION.

162
00:07:43,537 --> 00:07:44,905
HE BROUGHT IT WITH HIM?

163
00:07:44,938 --> 00:07:48,742
ALL THE WAY FROM YELLOWKNIFE.

164
00:07:50,877 --> 00:07:53,747
WHAT'S HER MOM'S MAIDEN NAME?

165
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:55,982
NELSON, SAME AS EMMA.

166
00:07:57,784 --> 00:08:00,854
OKAY THAT'S NOT IT. DOES SHE HAVE A DOG, A FISH?

167
00:08:00,887 --> 00:08:01,822
ANYTHING?

168
00:08:06,126 --> 00:08:09,496
AH, HERE WE GO. SECRET QUESTION?

169
00:08:10,130 --> 00:08:13,500
WHAT'S MOM'S FAVOURITE ROCK BAND? HUH.

170
00:08:15,969 --> 00:08:17,904
NEXT WEEK HE'S GOING TO BE SENDING THE PETITION OFF

171
00:08:17,938 --> 00:08:19,773
TO THE UNITED NATIONS.

172
00:08:19,806 --> 00:08:21,908
WOW. THAT'S INCREDIBLE.

173
00:08:21,942 --> 00:08:26,880
JORDAN IS A PRETTY IMPRESSIVE KID. AFTER YOU.

174
00:08:36,823 --> 00:08:39,092
HEY GUYS, THE PIZZA'S HERE.

175
00:08:45,165 --> 00:08:48,702
WE'RE GOING TO BE MAKING A VIDEO JOURNAL OF THIS TRIP.

176
00:08:48,735 --> 00:08:52,672
IT'S A REALLY BIG DEAL FOR THESE GUYS TO BE COMING HERE.

177
00:08:52,706 --> 00:08:55,976
WELL, THERE'S NO USE LETTING THIS GET COLD.

178
00:08:56,009 --> 00:08:59,045
THE GUYS ARE GOING TO BE BACK IN HERE ANY MINUTE.

179
00:08:59,079 --> 00:09:01,581
YOU KNOW, JORDAN TALKS ABOUT YOU ALL THE TIME.

180
00:09:01,615 --> 00:09:04,651
I HEAR THAT YOU'RE A FELLOW HIKER?

181
00:09:05,118 --> 00:09:07,721
I TAKE THE GUYS HIKING AROUND YELLOWKNIFE SOMETIMES.

182
00:09:07,754 --> 00:09:11,224
THERE ARE SOME REALLY AMAZING TRAILS THERE.

183
00:09:11,258 --> 00:09:13,727
WHAT'S THE MATTER, DO YOU DON'T LIKE MUSHROOMS?

184
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:16,963
NO, I'M NOT HUNGRY. DO YOU KNOW WHAT?

185
00:09:16,997 --> 00:09:19,065
I THINK I LEFT MY BAG DOWNSTAIRS.

186
00:09:19,099 --> 00:09:22,702
I'M JUST GOING TO GO AND SEE IF IT'S THERE.

187
00:09:25,005 --> 00:09:28,708
EMMA YOUR BAG IS RIGHT HERE.

188
00:09:42,422 --> 00:09:43,957
WHAT'S GOING ON?

189
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:48,628
YOU'RE JORDAN, AREN'T YOU?

190
00:09:49,763 --> 00:09:52,365
GIVE A BIG HAND TO DEGRASSI'S VERY OWN

191
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:55,669
ENVIRONMENTAL CRUSADER, CAITLIN RYAN.

192
00:09:56,102 --> 00:09:56,937
(APPLAUSE)

193
00:10:03,443 --> 00:10:09,249
WOW. THIS IS AMAZING. SEEING YOU ALL HERE TOGETHER AGAIN.

194
00:10:11,718 --> 00:10:14,988
YOU KNOW, I WAS ACTUALLY AFRAID TO COME HERE.

195
00:10:15,021 --> 00:10:17,724
AFRAID THAT NOTHING WOULD BE ABLE TO COMPARE

196
00:10:17,757 --> 00:10:20,760
TO OUR MEMORIES OF THIS PLACE OR THAT WE'D SPEND TONIGHT

197
00:10:20,794 --> 00:10:22,729
REHASHING OLD MISTAKES,

198
00:10:23,863 --> 00:10:26,199
YOU KNOW, COMPARING OURSELVES, WHO'S DONE WHAT-

199
00:10:26,232 --> 00:10:29,002
SHE'S PRETTY GOOD ISN'T SHE?

200
00:10:29,035 --> 00:10:31,137
SOME OF US THINK SO.

201
00:10:31,171 --> 00:10:33,373
SOME OF US AREN'T TOO SURE, ARE THEY, KEITH?

202
00:10:33,406 --> 00:10:34,908
EXCUSE ME?

203
00:10:36,443 --> 00:10:40,080
HEY ALISON - ARE YOU PLANNING ON GOING TO LOS ANGELES

204
00:10:40,113 --> 00:10:43,316
BEFORE OR AFTER HE BREAKS UP WITH CAITLIN?

205
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:44,884
OKAY. YOUR BIPOLAR JEALOUS THING

206
00:10:44,918 --> 00:10:46,319
HAS GOT A LITTLE OUT OF HAND.

207
00:10:46,353 --> 00:10:48,722
EXCUSE ME? WHAT KIND OF LOSER COMES TO

208
00:10:48,755 --> 00:10:50,690
HIS FIANCES HIGH SCHOOL REUNION

209
00:10:50,724 --> 00:10:52,292
AND TELLS A STRANGER THAT HE'S GOING TO BREAK UP WITH HER

210
00:10:52,325 --> 00:10:53,560
WHEN HE MAKES IT BIG.

211
00:10:53,593 --> 00:10:56,129
WHAT, YOU WERE EAVESDROPPING? THAT IS SO UN-COOL.

212
00:10:56,162 --> 00:10:56,997
UN-COOL?

213
00:10:57,030 --> 00:10:58,231
AND SO NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS.

214
00:10:58,264 --> 00:11:00,767
HEY, SHE'S MY FRIEND. I'LL MAKE IT MY BUSINESS.

215
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,869
AND EITHER YOU TELL HER OR I WILL.

216
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:05,939
JUST RELAX, JOEY.

217
00:11:06,506 --> 00:11:08,274
SO A TOAST TO-

218
00:11:08,308 --> 00:11:10,377
LISTEN TO ME, MAN.

219
00:11:12,145 --> 00:11:14,147
LIKE THAT, JOEY?

220
00:11:18,385 --> 00:11:18,785
JOEY...

221
00:11:26,393 --> 00:11:27,060
COME ON.

222
00:11:31,231 --> 00:11:33,900
IS THIS WHAT YOU WANT, HUH?

223
00:11:33,933 --> 00:11:36,870
IS THIS MORE IMPORTANT TO YOU? HUH?

224
00:11:38,038 --> 00:11:38,872
JOEY, COME ON.

225
00:11:38,905 --> 00:11:39,739
TAKE IT!

226
00:11:39,773 --> 00:11:41,474
WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON?

227
00:11:41,508 --> 00:11:43,877
THIS PSYCHO JUST CAME RUNNING AT ME WITH

228
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:44,911
ALL THIS CRAP ABOUT AH-

229
00:11:44,944 --> 00:11:47,347
JUST TELL HER BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE!

230
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:48,014
CATIE, THERE'S NOTHING GOING ON.

231
00:11:48,048 --> 00:11:49,516
TELL ME WHAT?

232
00:11:49,549 --> 00:11:51,317
HE'S INSANE! HE'S JEALOUS!

233
00:11:51,351 --> 00:11:52,452
TELL ME WHAT?

234
00:11:52,485 --> 00:11:56,856
SO HE HAS DOUBTS ABOUT GETTING MARRIED. WHO DOESN'T?

235
00:11:59,459 --> 00:12:02,896
YOU DON'T WANT TO MARRY ME, KEITH?

236
00:12:02,929 --> 00:12:04,397
CATE-LISTEN...

237
00:12:10,570 --> 00:12:13,173
MUSIC. EVERYONE, LET'S DANCE.

238
00:12:17,911 --> 00:12:20,180
I COULDN'T TELL YOU MY REAL AGE.

239
00:12:20,213 --> 00:12:21,981
I THOUGHT YOU'D STOP WRITING ME.

240
00:12:22,015 --> 00:12:24,284
I JUST - I WANT TO GO HOME!

241
00:12:24,818 --> 00:12:27,954
OKAY. BUT YOU CAN'T GO HOME IF YOU'RE LOCKED

242
00:12:27,987 --> 00:12:29,823
IN THE BATHROOM.

243
00:12:30,890 --> 00:12:34,961
EMMA PLEASE, THE LAST THING I WANT IS TO SCARE YOU.

244
00:12:35,528 --> 00:12:37,163
SO I'LL TELL YOU WHAT.

245
00:12:37,197 --> 00:12:41,367
I'M GOING TO GO DOWN TO THE LOBBY. YOU CAN LEAVE -

246
00:12:41,401 --> 00:12:46,806
OR YOU CAN STAY IF YOU WANT - JUST TO TALK. IT'S UP TO YOU.

247
00:13:04,624 --> 00:13:06,826
BRING BACK ANY MEMORIES?

248
00:13:08,094 --> 00:13:10,930
YOU KNOW WHAT? I'M RELIEVED -

249
00:13:10,964 --> 00:13:13,600
AS BIZARRE AS THAT MAY SOUND.

250
00:13:13,633 --> 00:13:16,136
IT DOESN'T SOUND THAT STRANGE.

251
00:13:17,170 --> 00:13:21,174
I MEAN HERE I AM, PRACTICALLY TURNING 30, RIGHT?

252
00:13:21,975 --> 00:13:25,078
AND NEVER HAD A RELATIONSHIP LAST LONGER THAN A FEW MONTHS.

253
00:13:25,111 --> 00:13:28,414
AND THEN, I GUESS I'M ALWAYS WORKING.

254
00:13:28,448 --> 00:13:32,452
I MEET KEITH -- AND HE'S NOT ALWAYS SUCH AN ASS.

255
00:13:33,486 --> 00:13:34,654
YOU COULD HAVE FOOLED ME.

256
00:13:34,687 --> 00:13:37,924
AND THEN, YOU KNOW, WHEN IT DOES LAST LONGER

257
00:13:37,957 --> 00:13:40,059
THAN A FEW MONTHS, I'M THINKING - WELL -

258
00:13:40,093 --> 00:13:42,529
YOU ASKED HIM TO MARRY YOU.

259
00:13:42,562 --> 00:13:44,564
I THOUGHT IT COULD WORK.

260
00:13:45,298 --> 00:13:48,968
HE'S SO NOT THE ONE. I MEAN IT'S SO OBVIOUS.

261
00:13:50,970 --> 00:13:54,474
I GAVE EMMA RELATIONSHIP ADVICE LAST NIGHT.

262
00:13:54,507 --> 00:13:56,009
I AM SUCH A FRAUD.

263
00:13:57,110 --> 00:14:00,380
NO, NO. NO, CAITLIN YOU'RE NOT A FRAUD.

264
00:14:01,948 --> 00:14:04,184
YOU-YOU'RE ONE OF THE MOST TRUSTING,

265
00:14:04,217 --> 00:14:05,952
CARING PEOPLE I KNOW.

266
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:09,556
YOU COULD NEVER BE A FRAUD.

267
00:14:11,624 --> 00:14:16,362
JOEY - WITH JULIA - HOW DID YOU KNOW - THAT IT WAS RIGHT?

268
00:14:32,679 --> 00:14:35,281
I LOVED THAT SHE CALLED ME JOE.

269
00:14:36,316 --> 00:14:38,585
HER HAIR SMELLED LIKE RAIN.

270
00:14:41,254 --> 00:14:44,324
AND SHE ALWAYS, ALWAYS MADE ME LAUGH.

271
00:14:48,995 --> 00:14:49,862
I'M SORRY.

272
00:14:49,896 --> 00:14:53,633
NO, NO, DON'T BE. I'M NOT. I WAS LUCKY.

273
00:14:56,703 --> 00:14:58,938
YEAH, YOU WERE.

274
00:14:58,972 --> 00:14:59,706
YEAH.

275
00:15:02,442 --> 00:15:04,944
THERE. PICTURE OF HER MOM.

276
00:15:04,978 --> 00:15:06,713
WHAT DOES HER T-SHIRT SAY?

277
00:15:06,746 --> 00:15:09,048
WHO WERE THE POGUES?

278
00:15:09,082 --> 00:15:14,287
COME ON, GUYS. EMMA WOULDN'T MAKE HER PASSWORD THAT EASY.

279
00:15:19,759 --> 00:15:22,161
IF I CAN DO IT, SO CAN JORDAN.

280
00:15:22,195 --> 00:15:24,464
SORRY EMMA, WE'RE GOING IN.

281
00:15:48,021 --> 00:15:50,657
ONE NOISE AND I TAPE YOUR MOUTH.

282
00:15:50,690 --> 00:15:53,526
AND I DON'T THINK YOU'D WANT THAT!

283
00:15:58,097 --> 00:16:00,333
I DON'T GET IT.

284
00:16:00,366 --> 00:16:03,403
SEE, LOOK HERE. YOU AND EMMA READ CHICKEN RUN.

285
00:16:03,436 --> 00:16:05,571
THE NEXT DAY SHE MENTIONS IT IN AN E-MAIL TO YOU.

286
00:16:05,605 --> 00:16:06,072
SO?

287
00:16:07,106 --> 00:16:09,208
JORDAN'S NEXT E-MAIL?

288
00:16:09,242 --> 00:16:12,245
HE LIKES CHICKEN RUN TOO. BIG DEAL.

289
00:16:12,278 --> 00:16:14,280
COINCIDENCE, RIGHT?

290
00:16:14,314 --> 00:16:15,415
BUT THE NEXT DAY, EMMA

291
00:16:15,448 --> 00:16:18,751
E-MAILS YOU SOME GARBAGE ABOUT HOW GREAT FRESH AIR IS.

292
00:16:18,785 --> 00:16:20,687
JORDO'S NEXT E-MAIL?

293
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:22,288
I LOVE HIKING.

294
00:16:22,322 --> 00:16:25,325
BEING OUT IN THE FRESH AIR MAKES ME FEEL SO FREE.

295
00:16:25,358 --> 00:16:27,727
EMMA WRITES TO YOU OR TO ANYONE,

296
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:29,162
HE ECHOES IT BACK TO HER.

297
00:16:29,195 --> 00:16:30,096
THE GUY'S NOT LOOKING INTO HER SOUL,

298
00:16:30,129 --> 00:16:32,131
HE'S READING HER E-MAIL.

299
00:16:41,174 --> 00:16:45,278
EMMA, YOUR MOTHER IS AT HER REUNION.

300
00:16:45,311 --> 00:16:49,015
SHE DOESN'T EVEN KNOW THAT YOU'RE MISSING.

301
00:16:49,382 --> 00:16:50,550
WE HAVE HOURS.

302
00:16:56,289 --> 00:16:58,658
THERE. HIS LAST MESSAGE.

303
00:16:58,691 --> 00:17:02,362
HE'S AT THE BARTLEY VALLEY, ROOM 1409.

304
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:09,068
WAIT UP!

305
00:17:16,676 --> 00:17:18,411
TOBY, COME ON!

306
00:17:29,856 --> 00:17:32,392
I LOVE BEING BACK HERE.

307
00:17:32,425 --> 00:17:34,727
I GET TO TEACH KIDS LIKE EMMA.

308
00:17:34,761 --> 00:17:36,596
I GET TO DANCE WITH HER MOTHER.

309
00:17:36,629 --> 00:17:38,698
SOMEONE'S GOTTEN SMOOTHER IN THE LAST TEN YEARS.

310
00:17:38,731 --> 00:17:40,233
MS. NELSON, MS. NELSON?

311
00:17:40,266 --> 00:17:41,667
SHE'S RIGHT OVER THERE.

312
00:17:41,701 --> 00:17:44,337
MS. NELSON - MS. NELSON!

313
00:17:44,370 --> 00:17:45,505
GUYS, WHAT'S UP?

314
00:17:45,538 --> 00:17:47,774
IT'S EMMA. WE FOUND OUT WHERE SHE WENT.

315
00:17:47,807 --> 00:17:51,144
WAIT A MINUTE. SLOW DOWN, SLOW DOWN.

316
00:17:51,177 --> 00:17:54,781
HELLO, POLICE? MY DAUGHTER IS IN DANGER!...

317
00:17:54,814 --> 00:17:55,915
I DON'T KNOW WHO SHE'S WITH.

318
00:17:55,948 --> 00:17:57,650
ALL I KNOW IS THAT IT'S SOMEONE SHE MET ON THE INTERNET.

319
00:17:57,683 --> 00:17:58,751
PLEASE HURRY!

320
00:17:59,585 --> 00:18:00,586
YOU GUYS GO HOME.

321
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:02,555
I'LL CALL YOUR PARENTS.

322
00:18:09,729 --> 00:18:12,532
EMMA... YOU SMELL SO SWEET...

323
00:18:33,386 --> 00:18:35,588
I FEEL SO CLOSE TO YOU.

324
00:18:42,829 --> 00:18:44,263
I'VE BEEN DREAMING ABOUT THIS,

325
00:18:44,297 --> 00:18:48,167
OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN. WAITING...

326
00:18:52,271 --> 00:18:53,172
EMMA!

327
00:18:53,206 --> 00:18:53,339
MOM!

328
00:18:54,373 --> 00:18:55,842
EMMA, ARE YOU IN THERE?! OPEN THE DOOR!

329
00:18:55,875 --> 00:18:56,676
EMMA!

330
00:18:56,709 --> 00:18:57,176
OW!

331
00:18:58,344 --> 00:18:58,911
OPEN THE DOOR NOW!

332
00:18:58,945 --> 00:19:00,713
OPEN THE DOOR!

333
00:19:01,481 --> 00:19:04,183
COME ON! ARE YOU OKAY?

334
00:19:04,784 --> 00:19:07,453
ARE YOU IN THERE?... ARE YOU OKAY?

335
00:19:12,892 --> 00:19:15,561
THERE'S BEEN A MISUNDERSTANDING.

336
00:19:18,965 --> 00:19:19,732
YOU MAKE A MOVE,

337
00:19:19,765 --> 00:19:22,568
I'M GONNA BREAK YOUR NECK. CLEAR?

338
00:19:32,612 --> 00:19:33,613
WHEN WILL WE GET IT BACK?

339
00:19:33,646 --> 00:19:35,748
YOU'LL GET IT BACK AFTER THE TRIAL.

340
00:19:35,781 --> 00:19:37,583
HE'S A REPEAT OFFENDER.

341
00:19:37,617 --> 00:19:41,521
AND THIS TIME THEY THINK THEY CAN NAIL THE CREEP.

342
00:19:41,554 --> 00:19:42,989
BUT WE NEED THIS AS EVIDENCE.

343
00:19:43,022 --> 00:19:44,156
SO HE'S GOING TO JAIL?

344
00:19:44,190 --> 00:19:48,628
OH YEAH. AND WHEN THIS COMES BACK, KEEP IT DOWNSTAIRS.

345
00:19:50,463 --> 00:19:53,799
KEEP THE CYBER STALKERS OUT OF HER ROOM.

346
00:20:11,817 --> 00:20:14,587
I'M SORRY I RUINED YOUR REUNION.

347
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:15,755
YOU HAD SOME FUN LAST NIGHT

348
00:20:15,788 --> 00:20:17,490
HOW COULD YOU DO THAT, EMMA?

349
00:20:17,523 --> 00:20:19,559
HOW COULD YOU DO SOMETHING SO INCREDIBLY STUPID?!

350
00:20:19,592 --> 00:20:20,726
I MADE A MISTAKE!

351
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:22,595
A MISTAKE?!

352
00:20:22,628 --> 00:20:25,665
YOU COULD HAVE BEEN - YOU COULD HAVE BEEN KILLED.

353
00:20:25,698 --> 00:20:27,500
YOU'VE NEVER MADE A MISTAKE BEFORE?

354
00:20:27,533 --> 00:20:28,601
LIKE MAYBE HAVING ME?

355
00:20:28,634 --> 00:20:30,469
IT'S NOT THE SAME THING.

356
00:20:30,503 --> 00:20:31,938
I SCREWED UP! I'M A DUMB KID!

357
00:20:31,971 --> 00:20:33,639
NO, YOU'RE NOT DUMB!

358
00:20:33,673 --> 00:20:36,275
THAT'S WHAT'S SO CONFUSING!

359
00:20:36,309 --> 00:20:38,311
YOU KEPT THIS GUY A SECRET FOR EIGHT MONTHS.

360
00:20:38,344 --> 00:20:39,612
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME?

361
00:20:39,645 --> 00:20:41,814
YOU KNOW YOU CAN TALK TO ME ABOUT ANYTHING!

362
00:20:41,847 --> 00:20:43,583
NO, I CAN'T! YOU'RE MY MOM.

363
00:20:43,616 --> 00:20:44,984
DON'T YOU GET IT?!

364
00:20:45,017 --> 00:20:47,486
YOU DON'T REMEMBER WHAT IT'S LIKE BEING TWELVE!

365
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:49,655
YOU DON'T REMEMBER ANYTHING!

366
00:20:51,524 --> 00:20:53,459
ACTUALLY, I DO.

367
00:20:56,562 --> 00:20:59,031
EM, WILL YOU REMEMBER ONE THING?

368
00:21:00,433 --> 00:21:02,501
EVEN WHEN YOU HATE MY GUTS?

369
00:21:03,603 --> 00:21:07,440
I'LL ALWAYS TRY TO LISTEN AND I'LL TRY TO UNDERSTAND.

370
00:21:07,473 --> 00:21:10,409
BUT WE HAVE TO KEEP TALKING, OKAY?...

371
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:18,684
I LOVE YOU MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE IN THE WORLD. OKAY?

372
00:21:22,421 --> 00:21:25,057
MOMMY, I WAS SO SCARED.

373
00:21:25,091 --> 00:21:28,561
I KNOW YOU WERE, BABY. I KNOW.
