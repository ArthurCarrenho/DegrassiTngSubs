18
00:00:45,486 --> 00:00:46,754

00:00:46,787 --> 00:00:50,391

AMAZING TURN OUT, ZERO PROBLEMS.

47
00:02:32,226 --> 00:02:33,760

50
00:02:42,636 --> 00:02:44,571
HEY PAIGE.

NOTHING, I WAS JUST GIVING HIM SOME NOTES FOR THE CLASS.

60
00:03:05,425 --> 00:03:07,895
SPINNER WANTS CLASS NOTES. SINCE WHEN?

61
00:03:07,928 --> 00:03:10,797
HUN, CALLED A FLIRTATION DEVICE.

62
00:03:10,831 --> 00:03:12,599
SOMETHING'S HAPPENING WITH YOU AND SPINNER?

63
00:03:12,633 --> 00:03:15,502
NO, ASHLEY'S GOT AN OVER ACTIVE IMAGINATION.

64
00:03:15,536 --> 00:03:17,838
YOU SHOULD TOTALLY ASK SPINNER TO GO WITH YOU TONIGHT.

65
00:03:17,871 --> 00:03:19,907
NO POINT, I CAN'T GO.

66
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:23,243
WHAT? YOU HAVE TO, YOU'RE ON THE DANCE COMMITTEE.

67
00:03:23,277 --> 00:03:27,614
ASH, IT'S NOT ME, IT'S MY DAD. HE'S MAKING ME DO CHORES.

68
00:03:27,648 --> 00:03:29,383
ON A FRIDAY, COME ON.

69
00:03:30,284 --> 00:03:32,686
IF TERRI CAN'T GO, TERRI CAN'T GO.

70
00:03:32,719 --> 00:03:36,523
ASHLEY, YOU'RE GOING TO BE LATE FOR THE ANNOUNCEMENTS.

71
00:03:36,557 --> 00:03:39,326

00:03:56,043 --> 00:03:57,411
BE GOOD.

75
00:04:12,626 --> 00:04:14,595
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU GUYS ARE CHICKENING OUT.

76
00:04:14,628 --> 00:04:16,029
WE'RE NOT CHICKENING OUT.

77
00:04:16,063 --> 00:04:16,463
FINE.

78
00:04:17,564 --> 00:04:19,299
WE'RE JUST NOT GOING TO THE DANCE. OKAY.

79
00:04:19,333 --> 00:04:22,402
I GUESS IT'S JUST ME AND YOU THEN.

80
00:04:22,436 --> 00:04:24,538
YOU DID TALK TO YOUR PARENTS?

81
00:04:24,571 --> 00:04:25,505
YES AND NO.

82
00:04:30,043 --> 00:04:34,348
THE DANCES DURING SCHOOL HOURS FINE, BUT IT'S AT NIGHT.

83
00:04:34,381 --> 00:04:36,917
SO, WHO AM I SUPPOSED TO GO WITH?

00:04:38,852 --> 00:04:40,520
GOOD MORNING PEOPLE.

I WOULD LIKE YOU TO MEET SEAN CAMERON.

86
00:04:46,126 --> 00:04:49,930
HE WAS HERE A FEW MONTHS LAST YEAR BEFORE HE MOVED UP NORTH.

87
00:04:49,963 --> 00:04:52,332
WHY DON'T YOU TELL THE CLASS A LITTLE BIT ABOUT YOURSELF?

88
00:04:52,366 --> 00:04:52,633

00:04:53,867 --> 00:04:56,637
OKAY, WELL MAYBE ONCE YOU'RE SETTLED IN.

00:06:39,206 --> 00:06:42,142
BECAUSE, WELL, YOU KNOW. ALL RIGHT.

WHAT ARE WE ON SOME TRASHOID TALK SHOW HERE?

121
00:07:12,606 --> 00:07:13,840
LEAVE HER ALONE.

122
00:07:13,874 --> 00:07:14,908
IT'S ABOUT HAVING FUN

123
00:07:14,941 --> 00:07:15,909
AND TERRI'S NOT GOING TO HAVE FUN

124
00:07:15,942 --> 00:07:18,745
UNTIL SHE STARTS FEELING BETTER ABOUT HERSELF.

125
00:07:18,779 --> 00:07:22,149
WE'LL HAVE A GREAT TIME WHOEVER WE DANCE WITH. I PROMISE.

126
00:07:22,182 --> 00:07:23,817
WELL IF THIS MAKEOVER HAS TO HAPPEN,

00:07:23,850 --> 00:07:25,218
I BETTER BE THERE TOO.

128
00:07:25,252 --> 00:07:28,588
TERRI NEEDS ALL THE SUPPORT SHE CAN GET.

129
00:07:29,656 --> 00:07:31,057
WELCOME, WHY DON'T YOU JUST TAKE THAT SEAT

130
00:07:31,091 --> 00:07:32,826

EMMA.

132
00:07:40,167 --> 00:07:42,202
THAT GIRL'S NOT HAPPY.

133
00:07:42,769 --> 00:07:43,537
EVER SINCE BOY BANDS REARED

134
00:07:43,570 --> 00:07:45,672
THEIR GENETICALLY PERFECT HEADS,

00:07:45,705 --> 00:07:47,974
THEY EXPECT US TO KNOW HOW TO DANCE.

136
00:07:48,008 --> 00:07:50,010
CURSE THEM AND THEIR FANCY FOOTWORK.

137
00:07:50,043 --> 00:07:53,613
ON THE OTHER HAND, WHAT ELSE IS THERE TO DO TONIGHT?

138
00:07:53,647 --> 00:07:56,650

140
00:07:58,118 --> 00:08:00,954
SHUT UP. EMMA'S NOT MY GIRLFRIEND.

141
00:08:01,321 --> 00:08:03,123
YEAH, WELL, FORGET ABOUT HER.

142
00:08:03,156 --> 00:08:04,925
I HAVE AN ALTERNATIVE.

00:08:29,249 --> 00:08:32,519
COME ON TOBY. IT'S A RITE OF PASSAGE.

152
00:08:34,287 --> 00:08:37,557
HEY BOYS, OPEN YOUR BOOKS.

153
00:08:42,362 --> 00:08:45,131

158
00:08:55,375 --> 00:08:59,112
OF PRE-PUBESCENT BOYS DICTATE YOUR AMUSEMENT.

159
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:11,658
I THOUGHT YOU SAID YOUR PARENTS WERE GOING OUT TONIGHT?

160
00:09:11,691 --> 00:09:14,794
HEY YOU GUYS SURE WE CAN'T GIVE YOU A RIDE TO THE DANCE?

161
00:09:14,828 --> 00:09:15,095
NO.

162
00:09:15,862 --> 00:09:16,129
OH.

179
00:09:57,704 --> 00:10:01,341
TOTALLY. I KNOW IT'S EARLY BUT I REALLY HAVE TO SET UP.

180
00:10:01,374 --> 00:10:03,343
TERRI, YOU ARE COMING?

181
00:10:03,376 --> 00:10:07,914
I GUESS SO. I JUST WISH I WASN'T SO NERVOUS.

182
00:10:08,348 --> 00:10:11,151
YOU GO ASH, I JUST WANT TO FRESHEN UP A BIT.

183
00:10:11,184 --> 00:10:12,118
TER, WANT TO WAIT.

184
00:10:12,152 --> 00:10:13,920
PAIGE, YOU LOOK FINE.

185
00:10:13,954 --> 00:10:18,258
PLEASE, IT'S BOILING IN HERE. I'VE SWEATED OFF ALL MY MAKEUP.

186
00:10:18,291 --> 00:10:20,060
IT'S OKAY, I'LL WAIT.

187
00:10:20,093 --> 00:10:20,994
ALL RIGHT BUT I'VE GOT TO RUN.

188
00:10:21,027 --> 00:10:23,797
TERRI I AM SO GLAD YOU CHANGED YOUR MIND.

189
00:10:23,830 --> 00:10:25,999
SPINNER IS GOING TO FREAK.

190
00:10:32,405 --> 00:10:35,308
CALL ME WHEN YOU WANT ME TO PICK YOU UP.

191
00:10:35,342 --> 00:10:37,444
YOU'RE SURE YOU'RE OKAY GOING IN THERE ALONE?

192
00:10:37,477 --> 00:10:38,712
I'M FINE.

193
00:10:38,745 --> 00:10:40,080
OKAY. GOOD LUCK.

194
00:10:41,848 --> 00:10:44,117
BUT DO NOT WALK HOME ALONE.

195
00:10:44,818 --> 00:10:45,819
MOM, PLEASE.

196
00:11:01,134 --> 00:11:02,802
OKAY, THAT'S BETTER.

197
00:11:02,836 --> 00:11:03,970
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU

198
00:11:04,004 --> 00:11:07,407
BUT I ALWAYS GET A LITTLE NERVOUS BEFORE THESE THINGS.

199
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,408
HEY, YOU OKAY?

200
00:11:09,676 --> 00:11:13,179
UM, DON'T YOU THINK THIS OUTFIT'S A LITTLE TOO SEXY?

201
00:11:13,213 --> 00:11:15,382
HON, IT'S NOT THAT WILD.

202
00:11:15,415 --> 00:11:17,884
THEN MAYBE IT'S NOT SEXY ENOUGH.

203
00:11:17,917 --> 00:11:21,721
WELL WE COULD ADD JUST A FEW FINAL TOUCHES.

204
00:11:24,324 --> 00:11:27,093
PAIGE I DON'T KNOW IF I CAN GO OUT LOOKING LIKE THIS.

205
00:11:27,127 --> 00:11:29,796
TERRI YOU'RE JUST NERVOUS. YOU NEED TO CALM DOWN.

206
00:11:29,829 --> 00:11:32,298
COME ON. I THINK WE COULD USE A LITTLE GLASS OF SHERRY.

207
00:11:32,332 --> 00:11:33,800
REALLY?

208
00:11:39,205 --> 00:11:40,273
YOU'RE SIGNS WERE BLAH.

209
00:11:40,306 --> 00:11:42,175
BUT NOW YOU CAN'T EVEN READ THEM.

210
00:11:42,208 --> 00:11:45,011
THEY'RE TOO COVERED IN GLITTER SQUIGGLES AND SPARKLES.

211
00:11:45,045 --> 00:11:46,746
IT'S CALLED MARKETING.

212
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:49,049
IT'S CALLED MESSY.

213
00:11:49,949 --> 00:11:51,351
FIVE DOLLARS PLEASE.

214
00:11:51,384 --> 00:11:53,920
IT GOES TOWARDS THE DEGRASSI COMMUNITY FOOD BANK

215
00:11:53,953 --> 00:11:57,457
ALTHOUGH YOU WOULDN'T KNOW IT FROM THE SIGN.

216
00:11:57,490 --> 00:11:59,159
FIVE DOLLARS PLEASE.

217
00:12:13,573 --> 00:12:19,512
HEY, IT'S LITTLE MISS BIG MOUTH AND LOOK SHE'S GOT A HEART ON.

218
00:12:21,414 --> 00:12:22,515
IT'S WEIRD.

219
00:12:22,549 --> 00:12:25,151
I DIDN'T SURF FOR THIS STUFF BEFORE

220
00:12:25,185 --> 00:12:27,554
BUT AS SOON AS KATE INSTALLED THE FILTER...

221
00:12:27,587 --> 00:12:29,456
WELL YOU CAN DISABLE IT RIGHT?

222
00:12:29,489 --> 00:12:32,859
YOU WEREN'T JUST MAKING THAT UP?

223
00:12:36,496 --> 00:12:37,330
IT'S GONE.

224
00:12:40,133 --> 00:12:42,469
OKAY. WHERE SHOULD WE START?

225
00:12:42,969 --> 00:12:45,238
FOXY LADIES, BABES IN HEAT.

226
00:12:46,339 --> 00:12:49,409
HOW ABOUT THE ONE WITH THREE X'S.

227
00:12:49,442 --> 00:12:52,378
OKAY, TRIPLE SEX X X, HERE WE COME.

228
00:12:58,518 --> 00:13:00,120
WHAT JUST HAPPENED?

229
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:02,822
THE STUPID CONNECTION DROPPED.

230
00:13:02,856 --> 00:13:05,358
WELL HOW LONG 'TIL IT'S BACK UP?

231
00:13:05,391 --> 00:13:08,128
COULD BE MINUTES, COULD BE HOURS.

232
00:13:12,866 --> 00:13:16,369
SEE, THE THING WITH GUYS, THEY LOVE IT WHEN YOU TAKE THE LEAD.

233
00:13:16,402 --> 00:13:17,270
THEY DO?

234
00:13:19,339 --> 00:13:23,543
THEY'RE SHY TOO. YOU CAN'T MAKE THEM DO ALL THE WORK.

235
00:13:25,445 --> 00:13:28,314
SO DON'T BE NERVOUS. BE YOURSELF.

236
00:13:28,348 --> 00:13:31,017
JUST MAYBE A LITTLE MORE SO.

237
00:13:31,050 --> 00:13:32,352
THIS IS HELPING.

238
00:13:32,385 --> 00:13:35,388
HERE, TAKE MINE. HON, THE MORE YOU HAVE,

239
00:13:35,421 --> 00:13:37,924
THE BETTER YOU FEEL. TRUST ME.

240
00:13:42,395 --> 00:13:45,064
THE CONNECTION'S BACK UP.

241
00:13:46,366 --> 00:13:48,401
BOOBAGE, HERE WE COME.

242
00:13:53,072 --> 00:13:53,606
AH, NICE.

243
00:13:56,075 --> 00:13:57,510
I'LL SAY.

244
00:13:57,544 --> 00:13:59,145
PICTURE NUMBER TWO.

245
00:14:05,251 --> 00:14:06,419
PAIGE, YOU SAVED ME.

246
00:14:06,953 --> 00:14:09,122
YEAH, YOU OWE ME BIG TIME.

247
00:14:09,155 --> 00:14:12,559
I DO. UM, YOU'RE SUCH A GOOD FRIEND

248
00:14:12,592 --> 00:14:17,397
AND I JUST OWE YOU FOR TONIGHT, FOR LOOKING OUT FOR ME.

249
00:14:18,698 --> 00:14:22,101
DO YOU ACTUALLY THINK I HAVE A SHOT WITH SPINNER?

250
00:14:22,135 --> 00:14:26,072
I LIKE HIM A LOT AND I WANT HIM TO LIKE ME TOO.

251
00:14:27,507 --> 00:14:30,543
OF COURSE YOU DO AND WE'RE GOING TO MAKE SURE IT HAPPENS.

252
00:14:30,577 --> 00:14:31,511
LET'S GO.

253
00:14:44,390 --> 00:14:46,693
FINALLY, I WAS STARTING TO THINK YOU WEREN'T COMING.

254
00:14:46,726 --> 00:14:50,363
FEAR NOT ASHLEY, WE'RE HERE.

255
00:14:50,396 --> 00:14:50,897
TERRI.

256
00:14:51,998 --> 00:14:56,202
BRING SPINNER ON. I'M WAITING FOR MY MAN.

257
00:14:56,236 --> 00:14:58,071
HAVE YOU BEEN DRINKING?

258
00:14:58,104 --> 00:15:00,340
I TRIED TO STOP HER.

259
00:15:00,373 --> 00:15:02,442
GET INSIDE, NOW.

260
00:15:04,010 --> 00:15:05,078
HOW'S IT GOING?

261
00:15:05,111 --> 00:15:06,346
PERFECT, MR. RADITCH.

262
00:15:06,379 --> 00:15:06,980
GOOD.

263
00:15:31,337 --> 00:15:34,073
HEY, I THOUGHT YOU WEREN'T COMING.

264
00:15:34,107 --> 00:15:36,442
OH YOU KNOW, I CHANGED MY MIND.

265
00:15:36,476 --> 00:15:36,676
COOL.

266
00:15:37,410 --> 00:15:38,544
HI SPINNER.

267
00:15:39,212 --> 00:15:40,480
YEAH, HI.

268
00:15:40,513 --> 00:15:42,448
TERRI, YOU LOOK, WOW.

269
00:15:44,617 --> 00:15:47,553
ASHLEY, MY FRIEND. I LOVE YOU.

270
00:15:47,587 --> 00:15:48,454
YEAH, I LOVE YOU TOO

271
00:15:48,488 --> 00:15:49,756
BUT MAYBE YOU SHOULD TONE IT DOWN A BIT

272
00:15:49,789 --> 00:15:52,091
BEFORE RADITCH REALIZES YOU'RE DRUNK.

273
00:15:52,125 --> 00:15:55,495
I'M NOT DRUNK. I'M JUST HAPPY.

274
00:15:55,528 --> 00:15:59,032
PAIGE, HOW MUCH DID SHE DRINK? AND DON'T LIE.

275
00:15:59,065 --> 00:16:01,634
I DON'T KNOW. A FEW GLASSES.

276
00:16:01,668 --> 00:16:06,773
WHAT WERE YOU THINKING? AND WHAT IS WITH HER SKIRT.

277
00:16:06,806 --> 00:16:09,042
TERRI, DO YOU WANT TO DANCE?

278
00:16:09,075 --> 00:16:11,711
I THOUGHT YOU'D NEVER ASK.

279
00:16:33,166 --> 00:16:35,435
HEY MAN, AFTER PARTY AT MY PLACE.

280
00:16:35,468 --> 00:16:36,269
IT'S GRADE EIGHTS ONLY

281
00:16:36,302 --> 00:16:38,771
BUT WE'LL MAKE AN EXCEPTION FOR YOU.

282
00:16:38,805 --> 00:16:40,373
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

283
00:16:40,406 --> 00:16:42,241
JUST STOP REMINDING ME, OKAY.

284
00:16:42,275 --> 00:16:44,277
IT SUCKS HAVING TO REPEAT THE SEVENTH GRADE,

285
00:16:44,310 --> 00:16:48,247
I DON'T HAVE TO HAVE YOU RUBBING IT IN MY FACE.

286
00:16:49,315 --> 00:16:51,451
DO YOU WANT TO DANCE?

287
00:16:53,486 --> 00:16:54,087
YEAH.

288
00:17:11,804 --> 00:17:14,340
OUR VERY FIRST DANCE.

289
00:17:15,341 --> 00:17:18,411
THIS IS GOING TO BE MY FAVORITE SPOT IN DEGRASSI,

290
00:17:18,444 --> 00:17:20,313
FROM NOW AND FOREVER.

291
00:17:23,583 --> 00:17:25,051
YOU'RE SO CUTE.

292
00:17:26,452 --> 00:17:28,554
I CAN'T BELIEVE I SAID THAT.

293
00:17:28,588 --> 00:17:30,423
UMM, THANKS.

294
00:17:31,858 --> 00:17:35,128
DO YOU BELIEVE IN LOVE AT FIRST SIGHT?

295
00:17:35,161 --> 00:17:36,562
UMM, I...

296
00:17:44,537 --> 00:17:48,474
WHOA, SHE CAN BE MY ONLINE OFFICER ANY TIME.

297
00:17:48,508 --> 00:17:49,175
OH YEAH.

298
00:17:51,210 --> 00:17:54,414
LET'S DO SOME MORE EXPLORATION, SHALL WE?

299
00:17:55,548 --> 00:17:56,149
THAT.

300
00:18:05,158 --> 00:18:06,692
WHOA. ARE THOSE REAL?

301
00:18:09,362 --> 00:18:10,430
REAL SOMETHING.

302
00:18:12,165 --> 00:18:15,735
ACTUALLY I'D SAY SILICON.

303
00:18:15,768 --> 00:18:18,438
OR SALINE SOLUTION.

304
00:18:55,608 --> 00:18:57,343
UMM, ARE YOU OKAY?

305
00:18:57,376 --> 00:18:59,912
I'M FINE. NEVER BETTER.

306
00:18:59,946 --> 00:19:01,414
OKAY.

307
00:19:02,415 --> 00:19:02,482
OH...

308
00:19:06,819 --> 00:19:08,554
ARE YOU OKAY?

309
00:19:08,588 --> 00:19:11,524
ACTUALLY I DON'T FEEL GOOD.

310
00:19:16,395 --> 00:19:18,898
I TOLD TERRI NOT TO DRINK SO MUCH.

311
00:19:18,931 --> 00:19:21,934
SO, DID YOU SAVE ME THAT DANCE?

312
00:19:21,968 --> 00:19:24,170
YEAH, I GUESS.

313
00:19:34,647 --> 00:19:35,348
TERRI.

314
00:19:41,420 --> 00:19:43,256
YOU ACTUALLY ASKED HIM TO DANCE?

315
00:19:43,289 --> 00:19:46,225
I KNOW. HE SEEMS REAL SCARY AND DANGEROUS

316
00:19:46,259 --> 00:19:47,627
BUT HE'S ACTUALLY PRETTY NICE.

317
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:49,295
I TOLD YOU IT WAS A STUPID IDEA.

318
00:19:49,328 --> 00:19:51,264
SO WHAT DID YOU GUYS DO FRIDAY NIGHT?

319
00:19:51,297 --> 00:19:52,965
NOTHING, WHY?

320
00:19:52,999 --> 00:19:55,601
NOTHING. JUST IMAGINE THE MOST EMBARRASSING POSSIBLE MOMENT

321
00:19:55,635 --> 00:19:59,238
OF YOUR LIFE, THEN MULTIPLY IT BY ETERNITY.

322
00:19:59,906 --> 00:20:01,274
WHAT HAPPENED?

323
00:20:01,307 --> 00:20:02,174
THE INTERNET.

324
00:20:02,208 --> 00:20:04,977
TOBY'S INSATIABLE, PERVERTED CURIOSITY.

325
00:20:05,011 --> 00:20:07,580
ME? IT WAS YOUR IDEA, REMEMBER?

326
00:20:07,613 --> 00:20:10,750
YOU GUYS STAYED HOME TO LOOK AT PORN.

327
00:20:10,783 --> 00:20:13,319
SO? IT'S A RITE OF PASSAGE.

328
00:20:13,352 --> 00:20:13,753
PLEASE.

329
00:20:14,787 --> 00:20:18,691
HIS DAD AND KATE CAME HOME EARLY AND FOUND US.

330
00:20:18,724 --> 00:20:21,027
THEY MADE US LOOK AT PORN SITES WITH THEM

331
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:23,262
INCLUDING SITES WITH MEN.

332
00:20:23,296 --> 00:20:25,998
TO TEACH US A LESSON ABOUT OBJECTIFYING WOMEN.

333
00:20:26,032 --> 00:20:28,000
THEY MADE YOU LOOK AT PORN.

334
00:20:28,034 --> 00:20:29,268
WITH THEM.

335
00:20:30,469 --> 00:20:31,804
MALE AND FEMALE.

336
00:20:32,305 --> 00:20:33,806
NOT SO LOUD, OKAY.

337
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:35,241
LOSERS.

338
00:20:48,754 --> 00:20:51,991
HEY, SO HOW COME YOU DIDN'T CALL ME ALL WEEKEND.

339
00:20:52,024 --> 00:20:55,828
'CAUSE I WANTED TO FALL OFF THE FACE OF THE EARTH AND DIE.

340
00:20:55,861 --> 00:20:56,896
WELL IF IT MAKES YOU FEEL ANY BETTER,

341
00:20:56,929 --> 00:20:58,831
MR. RADITCH SAYS WE CAN HAVE ANOTHER NIGHT DANCE

342
00:20:58,864 --> 00:21:00,032
NEXT SEMESTER.

343
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:02,935
AT LEAST I DIDN'T WRECK EVERYTHING.

344
00:21:02,969 --> 00:21:03,869
OF COURSE YOU DIDN'T.

345
00:21:03,903 --> 00:21:07,573
THINGS ARE GOING TO WORK OUT. TRUST ME.

346
00:21:08,074 --> 00:21:10,042
HEY, TERRI. HEY.

347
00:21:10,876 --> 00:21:12,812
ARE YOU FEELING BETTER?

348
00:21:13,946 --> 00:21:18,017
LOOK HERE ARE THOSE NOTES BACK. THANKS AGAIN.

349
00:21:18,050 --> 00:21:19,986
YEAH, TER, THANKS BUT SPINNER IS GOING TO USE MY NOTES

350
00:21:20,019 --> 00:21:21,287
FROM NOW ON.

351
00:21:25,024 --> 00:21:26,025
BYE.
