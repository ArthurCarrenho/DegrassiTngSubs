1
00:00:13,053 --> 00:00:15,089
OKAY GUYS.

2
00:00:17,358 --> 00:00:20,361
TOMORROW'S EXHIBITION GAME IS AGAINST EARL GREY.

3
00:00:20,394 --> 00:00:23,330
YOU'VE GOT TO COME OUT STRONG, PLAY HARD.

4
00:00:23,364 --> 00:00:24,531
NOW, MY FINAL CUTS WILL BE BASED

5
00:00:24,565 --> 00:00:27,334
ON HOW YOU PERFORM DURING THAT GAME.

6
00:00:27,368 --> 00:00:28,335
I'M SORRY, GENTLEMAN.

7
00:00:28,369 --> 00:00:31,238
I'VE 15 TALENTED PLAYERS HERE BUT ONLY 12 SPOTS.

8
00:00:31,271 --> 00:00:32,272
(bell rings)

9
00:00:32,806 --> 00:00:33,841
OKAY, GUYS BETTER GET CHANGED

10
00:00:33,874 --> 00:00:35,275
BEFORE YOU'RE LATE FOR HOMEROOM.

11
00:00:35,309 --> 00:00:36,043
GOOD JOB.

12
00:00:43,117 --> 00:00:45,452
DUDE. YOU HEARD ARMSTRONG. HOMEROOM CALLS.

13
00:00:45,486 --> 00:00:48,689
HOMEROOM CAN WAIT. I WANNA TRY THIS ONE MORE TIME.

14
00:00:48,722 --> 00:00:50,691
JIMMY. YOU BURNED UP THE FLOOR THIS MORNING.

15
00:00:50,724 --> 00:00:52,493
YOU'RE DOING FINE.

16
00:00:52,526 --> 00:00:55,829
FINE? I WANNA DO BETTER THAN THAT.

17
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:01,168
FROM DOWNTOWN! GO JIMMY!

18
00:01:01,201 --> 00:01:02,703
OH YEAH! WHO'S THE MAN?

19
00:01:02,736 --> 00:01:04,705
YOU'RE LOOKING AT HIM. DEGRASSI PANTHERS?

20
00:01:04,738 --> 00:01:07,341
JIMMY BROOKS IS ON THE PROWL!

21
00:01:08,342 --> 00:01:10,344
♪ WHAT EVER IT TAKES

22
00:01:11,612 --> 00:01:14,448
♪ I KNOW I CAN MAKE IT THROUGH

23
00:01:17,184 --> 00:01:18,585
♪ IF I HOLD OUT

00:01:20,687 --> 00:01:23,524

00:01:43,577 --> 00:01:46,413
♪ I KNOW I CAN MAKE IT THROUGH

31
00:01:53,487 --> 00:01:55,756
MS. KWAN. PLEASE. LET ME MAKE THE TEAM FIRST,

32
00:01:55,789 --> 00:01:57,124
THEN I'LL GIVE YOU MY AUTOGRAPH.

33
00:01:57,157 --> 00:02:00,461
HOW'S ABOUT YOU GIVE ME YOUR ENGLISH ASSIGNMENT INSTEAD?

34
00:02:00,494 --> 00:02:01,895
MY ASSIGNMENT. RIGHT.

35
00:02:01,929 --> 00:02:02,996
I WANTED TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT THAT...

36
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:05,466
JIMMY. I ALREADY GAVE YOU AN EXTENSION.

37
00:02:05,499 --> 00:02:07,768
YOU DID READ CHAPTER EIGHT FOR TODAY, RIGHT?

38
00:02:07,801 --> 00:02:09,169
OF COURSE!

39
00:02:09,203 --> 00:02:10,537
I'M TOTALLY ON TOP OF THE READING.

40
00:02:10,571 --> 00:02:11,572
IT'S JUST THE ACTUAL WORK...

41
00:02:11,605 --> 00:02:14,508
JIMMY, YOU'RE FALLING SERIOUSLY BEHIND.

42
00:02:14,541 --> 00:02:16,376
I'M CONCERNED YOU'RE NOT UP TO JUGGLING BOTH

43
00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:18,378
ACADEMICS AND SPORTS.

44
00:02:18,412 --> 00:02:20,481
AH, BUT JUGGLING IS A SPORT, MS. KWAN.

45
00:02:20,514 --> 00:02:24,451
THERE'S NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT. I'M FINE.

46
00:02:32,559 --> 00:02:35,395
ASHLEY? THE BELL'S GONNA RING ANY SECOND.

47
00:02:35,429 --> 00:02:37,464
WHERE IS SHE?

48
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:48,375
THERE'S A- THERE'S A LITTLE JOKE AT THE END.

49
00:02:50,244 --> 00:02:51,778
I THINK YOU'LL LIKE IT.

50
00:02:51,812 --> 00:02:56,884
WHAT I'D REALLY LIKE IS FOR YOU TO BE ON TIME. OKAY?

51
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:01,388
GOOD MORNING, DEGRASSI.

52
00:03:01,421 --> 00:03:03,490
TOMORROW, MORNING ANNOUNCEMENTS WILL BE REPLACED

53
00:03:03,524 --> 00:03:06,527
BY A VERY SPECIAL AFTERNOON PRE-GAME SCREENING,

54
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:09,296
AS THE DEGRASSI PANTHERS FACE OFF AGAINST EARL GREY

55
00:03:09,329 --> 00:03:13,000
IN AN EXHIBITION MATCH! SO GO, PANTHERS, GO!

56
00:03:13,033 --> 00:03:16,503
SHE'S PRETTY SUAV-E. GOT IT TOGETHER.

57
00:03:16,537 --> 00:03:18,939
IT'S NOT SUAV-E. IT'S SUAVE.

58
00:03:18,972 --> 00:03:21,775
TELEVISION IS SO STRESSFUL.

59
00:03:21,808 --> 00:03:22,976
ASHLEY DOESN'T SEEM STRESSED.

60
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:23,977
I KNOW!

61
00:03:24,011 --> 00:03:25,846
SHE'S, LIKE, BETTER THAN THE PEOPLE ON THE NEWS.

62
00:03:25,879 --> 00:03:28,415
CALM, COOL. A TOTAL NATURAL.

63
00:03:29,483 --> 00:03:32,386
SO IF YOU SEE THE EARL GREY TEAM HOLDING LIGHTERS-

64
00:03:32,419 --> 00:03:33,987
IT'S CAUSE THEY ALWAYS LOSE THEIR MATCHES!

65
00:03:34,021 --> 00:03:36,356
HAVE A GREAT DAY, GUYS!

66
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:39,426
LOSE THEIR MATCHES. NOT BAD.

67
00:03:39,459 --> 00:03:40,661
THAT'S MY JOKE!

68
00:03:40,694 --> 00:03:43,564
I MEAN, I WROTE IT AFTER I FOUND IT ON THE NET...

69
00:03:43,597 --> 00:03:44,665
IT'S TRUE, YOU KNOW.

70
00:03:44,698 --> 00:03:47,000
YOU DO ALL THE WORK AND ASHLEY TAKES ALL THE GLORY.

71
00:03:47,034 --> 00:03:48,635
YOU SHOULD REALLY TALK TO HER.

72
00:03:48,669 --> 00:03:49,937
OR QUIT.

73
00:03:51,138 --> 00:03:53,540
WHY SPEND MORE TIME IN SCHOOL THAN YOU ALREADY HAVE TO?

74
00:03:53,574 --> 00:03:55,576
YOU'RE GOING OUT FOR BASKETBALL.

75
00:03:55,609 --> 00:03:57,411
MY SOCIAL WORKER SAYS IT'S BENEFICIAL -

76
00:03:57,444 --> 00:03:58,879
PERSONALLY, I COULDN'T GIVE A RAT'S-

77
00:03:58,912 --> 00:04:02,516
--CLASS? SORRY FOR THE DELAY.

78
00:04:02,983 --> 00:04:03,984
IT JUST MAKES ME MAD

79
00:04:04,017 --> 00:04:07,387
THAT PEOPLE THINK ASHLEY'S SO FUNNY AND CLEVER

80
00:04:07,421 --> 00:04:10,424
WHEN ALL SHE'S DOING IS READING MY WORDS.

81
00:04:10,457 --> 00:04:12,726
YEAH. A MONKEY COULD DO THAT.

82
00:04:12,759 --> 00:04:14,995
PERSONALLY? I'D SAY IT'S TIME YOU ASKED PRINCESS ASHLEY

83
00:04:15,028 --> 00:04:16,563
TO SHARE THE AIR.

84
00:04:16,597 --> 00:04:18,131
BUT HEY, IT'S YOUR CAREER.

85
00:04:18,165 --> 00:04:22,436
ALRIGHT, TODAY WE'RE EXPLORING THE FASCINATING WORLD OF HTML.

86
00:04:22,469 --> 00:04:24,805
I'VE BEEN READING YOUR ASSIGNMENTS -

87
00:04:24,838 --> 00:04:27,874
WELL, THOSE THAT HAVE BEEN HANDED IN.

88
00:04:27,908 --> 00:04:30,477
YOUR THOUGHTS ON CHAPTER EIGHT HAVE BEEN FASCINATING.

89
00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:33,513
SO, LET'S OPEN IT UP FOR DISCUSSION.

90
00:04:34,114 --> 00:04:34,615
JIMMY?

91
00:04:35,616 --> 00:04:38,719
OH, UH. CHAPTER EIGHT? IT'S GREAT.

92
00:04:38,752 --> 00:04:40,053
JUST LIKE THE REST OF THE BOOK.

93
00:04:40,087 --> 00:04:41,088
COULD YOU ELABORATE?

94
00:04:41,121 --> 00:04:43,890
FOR EXAMPLE, WHICH CHARACTER DO YOU RELATE TO?

95
00:04:43,924 --> 00:04:47,461
WELL... THAT'S A VERY INTERESTING QUESTION, MS. KWAN.

96
00:04:47,494 --> 00:04:50,464
JIMMY? IT'S NOT THAT HARD.

97
00:04:50,497 --> 00:04:53,800
OKAY, UM. I ASSOCIATE MOST WITH...

98
00:04:55,769 --> 00:04:57,504
THE MAIN CHARACTER.

99
00:04:57,537 --> 00:05:00,807
IT'S AN ENSEMBLE PIECE. WHICH MAIN CHARACTER?

100
00:05:00,841 --> 00:05:03,610
THE LORD OF THE FLIES. WHO ELSE?

101
00:05:03,644 --> 00:05:05,946
THE LORD OF THE FLIES IS A SEVERED PIG'S HEAD

102
00:05:05,979 --> 00:05:07,581
RESTING ON A STAKE.

103
00:05:08,782 --> 00:05:12,519
YOU HAVEN'T READ THE BOOK HAVE YOU?

104
00:05:12,552 --> 00:05:15,422
BUSTED! TOTAL CRASH AND BURN.

105
00:05:15,455 --> 00:05:16,990
I'M DOOMED, MAN.

106
00:05:17,024 --> 00:05:19,526
COME ON. MS. KWAN CAN'T STOP YOU FROM PLAYING.

107
00:05:19,559 --> 00:05:20,727
SHE'S AN ENGLISH TEACHER.

108
00:05:20,761 --> 00:05:21,628
MY ENGLISH TEACHER,

109
00:05:21,662 --> 00:05:23,430
WHO'S THREATENING TO TALK TO MY COACH,

110
00:05:23,463 --> 00:05:24,931
WHO NEEDS TO CUT THREE PLAYERS.

111
00:05:24,965 --> 00:05:27,501
JIMMY, YOU'RE A TOTAL NATURAL.

112
00:05:27,534 --> 00:05:29,403
COACH ARMSTRONG'S NOT GONNA CUT YOU.

113
00:05:29,436 --> 00:05:31,605
JUST TRY HARDER AT SCHOOL.

114
00:05:33,573 --> 00:05:36,410
SCHOOL - THAT'S MY PROBLEM. IT'S TOTALLY IN THE WAY.

115
00:05:36,443 --> 00:05:38,845
I CONCENTRATE ON ENGLISH, MY PLAYING IS CRAP.

116
00:05:38,879 --> 00:05:39,880
I CONCENTRATE ON BASKETBALL,

117
00:05:39,913 --> 00:05:42,149
AND I DON'T HAVE ENOUGH TIME TO DO MY HOMEWORK.

118
00:05:42,182 --> 00:05:43,183
IT'S A NO-WIN SITUATION.

119
00:05:43,216 --> 00:05:46,086
GOT THAT RIGHT. IT'S A CATCH 42.

120
00:05:46,119 --> 00:05:47,954
CATCH 22.

121
00:05:47,988 --> 00:05:53,527
LIKE YOU KNOW. YOU THOUGHT YOU WERE LORD OF THE FLIES.

122
00:05:53,827 --> 00:05:56,863
AND NOW I'VE GOT KWAN ON MY BACK? I'M BAGGED, MAN.

123
00:05:56,897 --> 00:05:59,633
YEAH, I KNOW THE FEELING. SINCE THEY UPPED MY RITALIN?

124
00:05:59,666 --> 00:06:02,502
I'M, LIKE, A COMPLETE ZOMBIE.

125
00:06:02,536 --> 00:06:04,438
YEAH, BUT I'VE SEEN YOU WHEN YOU DON'T TAKE THEM.

126
00:06:04,471 --> 00:06:05,672
NOT PRETTY.

127
00:06:05,706 --> 00:06:10,577
YEAH, I KNOW. DON'T CALL ME SPINNER FOR NOTHING.

128
00:06:22,155 --> 00:06:24,458
ASHLEY? CAN I TALK TO YOU FOR A SECOND?

129
00:06:24,491 --> 00:06:25,726
NOW?

130
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:28,628
UM, TERRI, SAVE ME A SPOT, OKAY?

131
00:06:29,596 --> 00:06:31,198
HOW CAN I HELP YOU, LIBERTY?

132
00:06:31,231 --> 00:06:33,033
I WANT TO READ THE ANNOUNCEMENTS.

133
00:06:33,066 --> 00:06:34,468
WHAT?

134
00:06:34,501 --> 00:06:35,602
I DO ALL THE WRITING.

135
00:06:35,635 --> 00:06:37,838
IT'S ONLY FAIR IF I GET TO GO ON-AIR, ONCE IN A WHILE.

136
00:06:37,871 --> 00:06:40,974
LIBERTY, YOU'RE A WRITER, I'M A PERFORMER.

137
00:06:41,007 --> 00:06:43,443
YOU'RE YIN, I'M YANG. WE'RE VERY DIFFERENT.

138
00:06:43,477 --> 00:06:44,978
HOW?

139
00:06:45,011 --> 00:06:48,081
JUST- MAYBE NEXT YEAR. OKAY?

140
00:06:52,085 --> 00:06:56,823
REMEMBER FOLLOW THROUGH WITH THE WRIST. OKAY?

141
00:07:02,963 --> 00:07:04,498
NICE SHOT, SEAN.

142
00:07:04,798 --> 00:07:08,101
NOW YOU SEE HOW HE USES HIS LEGS AND NOT HIS HANDS?

143
00:07:08,135 --> 00:07:12,739
IT'S VERY IMPORTANT. JIMMY, WHY DON'T YOU GIVE IT A GO?

144
00:07:13,807 --> 00:07:15,876
OR YOU COULD JUST KEEP READING IF YOU WANT TO.

145
00:07:15,909 --> 00:07:17,644
SORRY, COACH.

146
00:07:23,083 --> 00:07:24,618
EXCELLENT TECHNIQUE, JIMMY.

147
00:07:24,651 --> 00:07:26,787
BUT WE'RE WORKING ON OUR SHOTS, NOT OUR LAY-UPS.

148
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:30,223
IMPRESS ME TOMORROW. GIVE IT ANOTHER TRY.

149
00:07:32,626 --> 00:07:34,594
A DEMAIN, MADAME PAGE.

150
00:07:34,628 --> 00:07:38,632
I'VE BEEN TOLD I HAVE A PERFECT PARISIAN ACCENT.

151
00:07:39,933 --> 00:07:42,135
I JUST WANT TO DO IT ONCE.

152
00:07:42,169 --> 00:07:43,870
LIBERTY, WHEN I SAID 'NO' THE LAST TIME -

153
00:07:43,904 --> 00:07:45,672
WHAT DIDN'T YOU UNDERSTAND?

154
00:07:45,705 --> 00:07:47,841
GIVE ME A CHANCE? COME ON. WHY NOT?

155
00:07:47,874 --> 00:07:49,976
BECAUSE IT'S MY JOB.

156
00:07:50,010 --> 00:07:51,678
FINE. THEN I'M GOING ON STRIKE.

157
00:07:51,711 --> 00:07:53,947
NO MORE RESEARCH, NO MORE WRITING, NO MORE JOKES.

158
00:07:53,980 --> 00:07:55,615
I FIGURE YOU CAN DO IT YOURSELF.

159
00:07:55,649 --> 00:07:59,719
IT TAKES ABOUT, OH, AN HOUR A DAY. IF YOU'RE FAST.

160
00:07:59,753 --> 00:08:01,822
LIBERTY. YOU'RE NOT PLAYING FAIR.

161
00:08:01,855 --> 00:08:05,592
I'M NOT PLAYING FAIR? YOU'RE THE ONE BEING GREEDY.

162
00:08:05,625 --> 00:08:08,295
IT'S JUST - I'M GOOD AT THIS!

163
00:08:08,328 --> 00:08:12,032
ANYBODY CAN READ A CUE CARD. A MONKEY COULD DO YOUR JOB!

164
00:08:12,065 --> 00:08:15,969
FINE. GO AHEAD. TOMORROW'S PRE-GAME ANNOUNCEMENTS,

165
00:08:16,002 --> 00:08:19,172
THEY'RE ALL YOURS. KNOCK YOURSELF OUT.

166
00:08:25,645 --> 00:08:26,646
JIMMY, WHAT'S UP BUDDY?

167
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:28,281
HEY SEAN. GOOD WORK OUT THERE TODAY.

168
00:08:28,315 --> 00:08:29,549
YOU'LL HAVE NO PROBLEMS MAKING THE TEAM.

169
00:08:29,583 --> 00:08:34,788
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT. I GUESS WE'LL SEE TOMORROW.

170
00:08:35,589 --> 00:08:38,859
DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT. WHATEVER. COACH LOVES HIM.

171
00:08:38,892 --> 00:08:41,895
SEAN PROBABLY MADE THE TEAM THE MINUTE HE SIGNED UP.

172
00:08:41,928 --> 00:08:44,030
JIMMY, SEAN'S A GOOD PLAYER.

173
00:08:44,064 --> 00:08:46,266
YEAH? SO AM I.

174
00:08:46,299 --> 00:08:47,667
AND WHO'S SAYING YOU'RE NOT?

175
00:08:47,701 --> 00:08:52,038
COACH ARMSTRONG. YOU SAW HIM JUST NOW. TORE MY GAME APART.

176
00:08:52,072 --> 00:08:54,107
HE WAS JUST GIVING YOU POINTERS.

177
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:56,009
HELLO? I KNOW HOW TO SHOOT A BASKET.

178
00:08:56,042 --> 00:08:57,644
AND SORRY - BUT LAY-UPS?

179
00:08:57,677 --> 00:08:59,779
WAY MORE IMPORTANT THAN 3-POINTERS.

180
00:08:59,813 --> 00:09:02,749
LOOK. IF YOU DON'T MAKE THE TEAM -

181
00:09:02,782 --> 00:09:05,919
WHICH YOU WILL - YOU CAN BE MY CO-MANAGER.

182
00:09:05,952 --> 00:09:07,888
THANKS, BUT - IT'S NOT THE SAME.

183
00:09:07,921 --> 00:09:09,055
RIGHT.

184
00:09:09,089 --> 00:09:13,293
NOT MUCH GLORY HANDING OUT TOWELS AND BOTTLES OF WATER.

185
00:09:13,326 --> 00:09:15,896
ANYWAY. LET'S GO CATCH A MOVIE OR SOMETHING,

186
00:09:15,929 --> 00:09:17,330
GET YOUR MIND OFF THIS.

187
00:09:17,364 --> 00:09:23,203
CAN'T, PULLING AN ALL-NIGHTER. GOT THAT ASSIGNMENT, REMEMBER?

188
00:09:28,742 --> 00:09:30,243
WISH THERE WAS A PILL I COULD TAKE.

189
00:09:30,277 --> 00:09:32,345
ONE THAT WOULD BOOST ME UP.

190
00:09:33,947 --> 00:09:36,850
RITALIN WOULD BOOST YOU UP BIG TIME.

191
00:09:36,883 --> 00:09:39,319
IT'S LIKE 50 CUPS OF COFFEE.

192
00:09:39,352 --> 00:09:41,755
I THOUGHT IT WAS SUPPOSED TO CALM PEOPLE DOWN.

193
00:09:41,788 --> 00:09:44,357
IT DOES - CALM ME DOWN.

194
00:09:44,391 --> 00:09:48,762
HAS SOMETHING TO DO WITH THE CONFIGURATION OF MY BRAIN.

195
00:09:48,795 --> 00:09:51,231
YOU HAVE A BRAIN?

196
00:09:51,264 --> 00:09:55,302
HA HA. BUT FOR NORMAL PEOPLE? EXACT OPPOSITE.

197
00:09:55,335 --> 00:09:56,870
IT'S LIKE SPEED.

198
00:09:57,370 --> 00:09:58,638
WEIRD.

199
00:09:58,672 --> 00:10:02,375
YEAH, BUT YOU KNOW, SON, DRUGS AREN'T THE ANSWER.

200
00:10:02,409 --> 00:10:03,610
JUST SAY NO.

201
00:10:12,953 --> 00:10:14,354
RALPH.

202
00:10:14,387 --> 00:10:15,522
PARDON ME?

203
00:10:15,555 --> 00:10:18,825
YOU ASKED WHO I RELATED TO IN LORD OF THE FLIES.

204
00:10:18,858 --> 00:10:19,926
IT WAS RALPH.

205
00:10:31,905 --> 00:10:34,841
I'M WIPED. I'VE GOT NOTHING LEFT FOR THE GAME.

206
00:10:34,874 --> 00:10:37,010
MAN, YOU GOT YOUR ENGLISH ASSIGNMENT DONE.

207
00:10:37,043 --> 00:10:39,679
MS. KWAN WILL GET OFF YOUR BACK NOW.

208
00:10:39,713 --> 00:10:43,350
DOESN'T HELP IF I DON'T MAKE THE TEAM.

209
00:10:48,388 --> 00:10:50,991
BUT YOU COULD HELP ME, SPINNER.

210
00:10:57,464 --> 00:10:58,064
NO WAY.

211
00:10:59,232 --> 00:11:01,868
IT'S NOT LIKE IT'S STEROIDS. I MEAN, IT'S NOT ILLEGAL.

212
00:11:01,901 --> 00:11:05,138
OF COURSE IT'S NOT ILLEGAL. YOU SEE ME IN JAIL?

213
00:11:05,171 --> 00:11:08,241
OKAY, GUYS, LET'S DISCUSS THE NEXT CHAPTER.

214
00:11:08,274 --> 00:11:12,779
PLEASE, I NEED IT. LOOK AT ME, I'M HALF-ALIVE.

215
00:11:13,813 --> 00:11:17,851
JIMMY, ITS MY LAST PILL I CAN'T MISS IT.

216
00:11:17,884 --> 00:11:20,987
JUST THIS ONCE. A LITTLE ENERGY BOOST.

217
00:11:21,021 --> 00:11:25,425
THIS GAME'S MY LAST CHANCE TO PROVE MYSELF TO ARMSTRONG.

218
00:11:25,458 --> 00:11:26,259
PLEASE?

219
00:11:36,936 --> 00:11:38,371
SO - DO I TAKE IT NOW?

220
00:11:38,405 --> 00:11:42,776
I GUESS. TAKES ABOUT AN HOUR TO KICK IN.

221
00:11:44,210 --> 00:11:45,011
YES, JIMMY?

222
00:11:45,045 --> 00:11:48,081
I NEED TO USE THE WASHROOM.

223
00:12:06,299 --> 00:12:09,102
JIMMY! GOOD LUCK THIS AFTERNOON WITH THE GAME.

224
00:12:09,135 --> 00:12:11,071
THANKS, MR. RADITCH.

225
00:12:11,104 --> 00:12:13,273
GO GET 'EM, SON!

226
00:12:35,528 --> 00:12:37,130
WHAT HAPPENED TO ASHLEY?

227
00:12:37,163 --> 00:12:39,466
LIBERTY! WE'RE ON.

228
00:12:39,499 --> 00:12:40,433
SHE'S DOING A GREAT JOB.

229
00:12:40,467 --> 00:12:42,469
THIS IS JUST SAD.

230
00:12:46,139 --> 00:12:50,210
WELCOME TO DEGRASSI' SPECIAL PRE GAME ANNOUNCEMENTS.

231
00:12:50,243 --> 00:12:55,014
TODAY THE DEGRASSI PANTHERS START A WHOLE NEW REASON-

232
00:12:55,048 --> 00:12:59,452
SEASON OF BASKET--BALL BASKETBALL BY BITING EARL GREY

233
00:13:06,226 --> 00:13:09,863
YOU CAN RUN BUT YOU CAN'T HIDE EARL GREY -

234
00:13:09,896 --> 00:13:13,133
THE PROWL IS ON THE PANTHERS.

235
00:13:13,166 --> 00:13:16,169
THE PANTHERS ARE ON THE PROWL!

236
00:13:18,404 --> 00:13:23,510
THIS HAS BEEN LIBERTY VAN ZANDT FILLING IN FOR ASHLEY KERWIN.

237
00:13:23,543 --> 00:13:25,612
MORE LIKE LOSER VAN ZANDT.

238
00:13:25,645 --> 00:13:30,250
GOOD JOB, ASH. I'M IMPRESSED. YOU TOTALLY SET HER UP.

239
00:13:41,628 --> 00:13:43,396
SOMEBODY HAD A NUTRITIOUS BREAKFAST.

240
00:13:43,429 --> 00:13:48,101
YUP. TOAST, CHEESE, EGGS, BACON. SOLID PROTEIN.

241
00:13:48,134 --> 00:13:51,137
LOVE PROTEIN. BRAIN FOOD, MAN. BRAIN FOOD.

242
00:13:51,171 --> 00:13:55,108
ALRIGHT. HOW YOU GUYS DOING? ARE YOU PUMPED?

243
00:13:55,141 --> 00:13:58,478
YOU KNOW IT, COACH. YOU KNOW IT.

244
00:14:04,984 --> 00:14:06,986
COME ON JIMMY SHOW THEM WHAT YOU GOT!

245
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:09,589
COME ON. START THIS GAME. COME ON.

246
00:14:09,622 --> 00:14:13,326
WHAT'S WRONG WITH ALL OF YOU. C'MON.

247
00:14:17,964 --> 00:14:20,600
JIMMY PASS THE BALL, JIMMY.

248
00:14:21,434 --> 00:14:23,469
COME ON, COME ON!

249
00:14:23,503 --> 00:14:25,438
PASS THE BALL!

250
00:14:26,272 --> 00:14:27,574
OH YEAH!

251
00:14:29,509 --> 00:14:32,512
DEGRASSI LEADS, 3-0.

252
00:14:34,547 --> 00:14:40,153
NOT BAD FOR YOUR FIRST TIME. YOU WANNA HEAD OVER TO THE GYM?

253
00:14:43,723 --> 00:14:47,460
THAT'S HER. OH MY GOD. THAT'S SO FUNNY.

254
00:14:47,493 --> 00:14:48,962
LIBERTY!

255
00:14:50,096 --> 00:14:52,265
YO JIMMY YOU'RE THE MAN! YEAH

256
00:14:52,298 --> 00:14:56,369
COME ON, GO, JIMMY! GO, JIMMY! GO! GO! GO, JIMMY!

257
00:15:08,314 --> 00:15:11,951
GAVIN. YOU'RE TEAM MANAGER, NOT OUR HEAD CHEERLEADER.

258
00:15:11,985 --> 00:15:15,188
C'MON, COACH! I WAS JUST GIVING JIMMY SOME MORTAL SUPPORT.

259
00:15:15,221 --> 00:15:16,990
MORAL SUPPORT. YOU WANNA SHOW YOUR SUPPORT?

260
00:15:17,023 --> 00:15:18,958
CLEAN UP THIS BENCH.

261
00:15:18,992 --> 00:15:20,593
BRING IT IN GUYS. GOOD JOB, GOOD JOB.

262
00:15:20,627 --> 00:15:22,028
HALF-TIME CONFERENCE IN THE LOCKER-ROOM.

263
00:15:22,061 --> 00:15:22,595
LET'S GO.

264
00:15:23,696 --> 00:15:25,365
JIMMY.

265
00:15:25,398 --> 00:15:29,235
HALF-TIME 22 TO 24 DEGRASSI.

266
00:15:45,518 --> 00:15:47,053
LIBERTY?

267
00:15:49,389 --> 00:15:51,391
I KNOW YOU'RE IN HERE.

268
00:15:54,527 --> 00:15:56,129
LIBERTY. COME ON.

269
00:15:57,263 --> 00:15:59,165
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

270
00:15:59,198 --> 00:16:01,000
I JUST WANT TO TALK TO YOU.

271
00:16:01,034 --> 00:16:03,436
WHAT? TO TELL ME I WAS HORRIBLE?

272
00:16:03,469 --> 00:16:06,606
THANKS, I ALREADY FIGURED IT OUT.

273
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:08,107
YOU WEREN'T GREAT.

274
00:16:08,141 --> 00:16:11,144
BUT YOU WEREN'T COMPLETELY HORRIBLE.

275
00:16:17,717 --> 00:16:19,485
I - I WASN'T?

276
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:24,424
NO - YOU JUST NEED A FEW POINTERS. I'VE GOT A PLAN.

277
00:16:24,457 --> 00:16:26,059
TRUST ME ON THIS.

278
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:30,296
LISTEN UP, WE'RE IN THE LEAD.

279
00:16:30,330 --> 00:16:34,734
STAY WITH YOUR MAN, KEEP UP THE PACE, PLAY LIKE A TEAM.

280
00:16:36,536 --> 00:16:37,603
YOU HEARING ME, JIMMY?

281
00:16:37,637 --> 00:16:41,641
LOUD AND CLEAR, COACH A. LOUD AND CLEAR.

282
00:16:52,218 --> 00:16:57,256
YO, DEGRASSI! WHO HERE NEEDS SOME HALF-TIME ENTERTAINMENT??

283
00:16:57,290 --> 00:17:00,693
I HEAR YOU, BROTHERS AND SISTERS!

284
00:17:29,389 --> 00:17:31,791
GOOD NIGHT, DEGRASSI!

285
00:17:32,558 --> 00:17:33,326
WHAT WERE YOU THINKING?

286
00:17:33,359 --> 00:17:35,595
I DUNNO. IT WAS FUNNY.

287
00:17:35,628 --> 00:17:39,832
FUNNY? IT WASN'T FUNNY. IT MADE US LOOK LIKE IDIOTS.

288
00:17:39,866 --> 00:17:40,500
BUT MR. RADITCH--

289
00:17:40,533 --> 00:17:41,367
SIT DOWN!

290
00:17:44,570 --> 00:17:47,874
FIRST, NO EXTRA-CURRICULAR ACTIVITIES.

291
00:17:47,907 --> 00:17:50,143
UNTIL THE END OF SEMESTER.

292
00:17:50,176 --> 00:17:51,310
WHAT?! BUT MR. RADITCH--

293
00:17:51,344 --> 00:17:53,713
--NO DISCUSSION. CONSIDER YOURSELF LUCKY.

294
00:17:53,746 --> 00:17:56,382
I COULD SUSPEND YOU FOR THIS.

295
00:17:56,416 --> 00:17:59,485
BUT SIR, IT'S - IT'S MEDICAL!

296
00:18:01,621 --> 00:18:06,826
GAVIN. YOU'VE BEEN TAKING RITALIN FOR TWO YEARS NOW.

297
00:18:06,859 --> 00:18:10,329
YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU MISS A PILL.

298
00:18:10,363 --> 00:18:13,533
UNLESS THERE'S SOME OTHER EXPLANATION.

299
00:18:16,836 --> 00:18:19,205
I - I FORGOT. OKAY?

300
00:18:19,238 --> 00:18:21,707
FINE. BUT YOU WON'T FORGET AGAIN.

301
00:18:21,741 --> 00:18:23,910
BECAUSE YOU'LL TAKE THEM IN FRONT OF MY SECRETARY -

302
00:18:23,943 --> 00:18:25,178
BUT MR. RADITCH -

303
00:18:25,211 --> 00:18:27,513
- THREE TIMES A DAY.

304
00:18:33,886 --> 00:18:36,556
MRS. SMITH? CAN YOU COME IN HERE, PLEASE?

305
00:18:36,589 --> 00:18:40,293
I WANT YOU TO BRING MR. MASONS FILE.

306
00:18:50,837 --> 00:18:54,841
JIMMY, PASS THE BALL! I'M OPEN! PASS IT--

307
00:18:58,344 --> 00:19:02,348
SEAN PASS THE BALL! SEAN I'M OPEN, SEAN!

308
00:19:07,553 --> 00:19:11,557
YEAH WHO'S THE MAN? THAT'S WHAT I TALKIN' ABOUT.

309
00:19:15,228 --> 00:19:17,797
SEAN ARE YOU OKAY, IS IT YOUR ANKLE?

310
00:19:17,830 --> 00:19:20,199
I WANT YOU TO WIGGLE YOU TOES FOR ME.

311
00:19:20,233 --> 00:19:23,436
DEGRASSI WINS! 39 - 37.

312
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:28,941
DEGRASSI RULES!

313
00:19:28,975 --> 00:19:31,344
I BET WE GO ALL THE WAY TO REGIONALS.

314
00:19:31,377 --> 00:19:33,379
WHAT WAS UP WITH THAT JIMMY GUY OUT THERE?

315
00:19:33,412 --> 00:19:34,447
HE WAS LIKE A LUNATIC.

316
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:36,616
SPORTS ARE NOT FOR THE WEAK OF HEART.

317
00:19:36,649 --> 00:19:37,817
LIKE YOU'D KNOW.

318
00:19:37,850 --> 00:19:39,652
AND BESIDES THAT DOESN'T MEAN YOU GET TO INJURE PEOPLE.

319
00:19:39,685 --> 00:19:41,354
OH NO.

320
00:19:41,387 --> 00:19:42,421
WAY TO GO, DEGRASSI!

321
00:19:42,455 --> 00:19:45,525
OUR TEAM JUST KICKED SOME SERIOUS EARL GREY BUTT.

322
00:19:45,558 --> 00:19:47,894
LIBERTY SAID "BUTT"?

323
00:19:47,927 --> 00:19:50,429
JUST BEFORE THE BUZZER WE SCORED A AWESOME 3-POINTER

324
00:19:50,463 --> 00:19:52,465
WINNING THE GAME 39 TO 37.

325
00:19:52,498 --> 00:19:55,668
SHE'S ACTUALLY DOING - OKAY!?

326
00:19:55,701 --> 00:19:58,404
PANTHERS - YOU'RE OFF TO A SENSATIONAL START.

327
00:19:58,437 --> 00:20:00,640
THIS IS LIBERTY VAN ZANDT, WRAPPING UP TODAY'S

328
00:20:00,673 --> 00:20:03,509
SPECIAL VIDEO COVERAGE. THANK YOU.

329
00:20:05,945 --> 00:20:07,613
SEE? IT'S NOT SO HARD.

330
00:20:07,647 --> 00:20:10,616
THE TRICK IS TO REMAIN CALM, COOL - AND SURE OF YOURSELF.

331
00:20:10,650 --> 00:20:12,251
YOU'RE PRETTY GOOD AT THAT ALREADY.

332
00:20:12,285 --> 00:20:13,519
THANK YOU, ASHLEY.

333
00:20:13,553 --> 00:20:14,620
AND YOU'LL BE EVEN BETTER WHEN YOU READ

334
00:20:14,654 --> 00:20:19,225
THE ANNOUNCEMENTS AGAIN. NEXT YEAR. AFTER I GRADUATE.

335
00:20:30,403 --> 00:20:34,373
JIMMY? CAN I TALK TO YOU FOR A SEC?

336
00:20:34,407 --> 00:20:35,942
IT'S ABOUT THIS AFTERNOON, OUT ON THE COURT -

337
00:20:35,975 --> 00:20:39,412
I KNOW - 12 POINTS, PLUS THE GAME POINT?

338
00:20:39,445 --> 00:20:41,581
IT'S THE BEST I'VE EVER PLAYED.

339
00:20:41,614 --> 00:20:44,550
IN TERMS OF SCORING, YES.

340
00:20:44,584 --> 00:20:48,821
BUT YOU SHOWBOATED, YOU BALL HOGGED, YOU BLEW PLAYS.

341
00:20:48,854 --> 00:20:51,023
YOU WEREN'T A TEAM PLAYER.

342
00:20:52,658 --> 00:20:54,060
I - I KNOW.

343
00:20:54,093 --> 00:20:57,496
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT WORRIES ME? IS WHAT YOU DID TO SEAN.

344
00:20:57,530 --> 00:20:59,465
YOU KNOW YOU ALMOST BROKE HIS ANKLE OUT THERE?

345
00:20:59,498 --> 00:21:00,633
THAT WAS AN ACCIDENT -

346
00:21:00,666 --> 00:21:03,603
ACCIDENT? COME ON JIMMY.

347
00:21:03,636 --> 00:21:07,306
YOU FOULED YOUR OWN PLAYER. DELIBERATELY.

348
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:12,378
YOU KNOW WE HAVE A ZERO TOLERANCE POLICY FOR VIOLENCE.

349
00:21:12,411 --> 00:21:16,682
IT WAS STUPID. IT'LL NEVER HAPPEN AGAIN. I PROMISE.

350
00:21:16,716 --> 00:21:22,054
I CAN'T TAKE THAT CHANCE. SORRY, JIMMY. YOU'RE CUT.
