1
00:00:02,309 --> 00:00:04,545
READ IT AGAIN, MANNY.

2
00:00:04,578 --> 00:00:07,214
AGAIN? I READ IT SIX TIMES.

3
00:00:07,247 --> 00:00:09,516
JUST ONE MORE TIME. PLEASE.

4
00:00:10,084 --> 00:00:13,721
OKAY. EMMA: YOU SAVED MY HEART AND MY PROJECT.

5
00:00:15,756 --> 00:00:17,591
IF WE PROTECT THE WILDLIFE REFUGE,

6
00:00:17,624 --> 00:00:20,594
I OWE IT ALL TO YOU. LOVE YOU, JORDAN.

7
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:25,499
LOVE YOU - LOVE YOU.

8
00:00:26,433 --> 00:00:26,734
OOOOH!

9
00:00:27,601 --> 00:00:30,804
LET ME SEE HIS PICTURE AGAIN.

10
00:00:31,572 --> 00:00:34,141
HE GETS CUTER EACH TIME I SEE HIS FACE.

11
00:00:34,174 --> 00:00:36,543
IS THAT POSSIBLE?

12
00:00:36,577 --> 00:00:38,112
HEY MANNY, DON'T WRECK THAT.

13
00:00:38,145 --> 00:00:40,547
I WANT CAITLIN TO AUTOGRAPH IT.

14
00:00:50,557 --> 00:00:52,826
EMMA? READY TO GO?

15
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:54,128
JUST A MINUTE.

16
00:00:54,161 --> 00:00:55,295
WE DON'T HAVE A MINUTE.

17
00:00:55,329 --> 00:00:57,598
J.T. IS WAITING FOR US.

18
00:01:00,868 --> 00:01:03,370
EM, YOUR ROOM'S A DISASTER.

19
00:01:03,404 --> 00:01:04,705
I THOUGHT YOU WERE GOING TO CLEAN IT UP.

20
00:01:04,738 --> 00:01:05,539
I WILL.

21
00:01:05,572 --> 00:01:08,375
AND TURN OFF THAT COMPUTER.

22
00:01:08,409 --> 00:01:13,347
I WAS JUST SHOWING MANNY YOUR REUNION WEBSITE.

23
00:01:15,582 --> 00:01:19,686
I ALWAYS KNEW SHE'D MAKE IT BIG.

24
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:21,422
HOW'S THAT FOR A HAIRDO?

25
00:01:21,455 --> 00:01:23,390
COULD I HAVE BEEN ANY COOLER?

26
00:01:23,424 --> 00:01:24,091
UH YEAH.

27
00:01:24,958 --> 00:01:27,694
MY TEN YEAR REUNION. WOW.

28
00:01:27,728 --> 00:01:31,131
IT'S GOING TO BE GREAT TO SEE EVERYONE AGAIN.

29
00:01:31,165 --> 00:01:32,666
I'M GETTING AS BAD AS YOU GUYS.

30
00:01:32,699 --> 00:01:34,401
COME ON. LET'S GO.

31
00:01:38,238 --> 00:01:40,507
THAT'S COOL STUFF YOU COLLECTED FOR THE REUNION.

32
00:01:40,541 --> 00:01:42,276
THANKS.

33
00:01:43,410 --> 00:01:45,345

NO PROBLEM, MISS NELSON.

47
00:02:38,298 --> 00:02:39,399
IT GIVES US A CHANCE TO SEE THE SCHOOL.

48
00:02:39,433 --> 00:02:41,268
DON'T YOU THINK WE'LL BE SEEING ENOUGH OF IT

49
00:02:41,301 --> 00:02:43,337
OVER THE NEXT YEAR?

50
00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:44,938
ARE YOU SURE YOU CAN HANDLE THAT?

51
00:02:44,972 --> 00:02:47,474
I SMALL BUT STRONG - LIKE BULL.

52
00:02:47,508 --> 00:02:49,209
SPEAKING OF BULL-

53
00:02:49,243 --> 00:02:51,245
THANKS AGAIN, GUYS. AND EM?

54
00:02:51,278 --> 00:02:53,280
YES, I'LL CLEAN MY ROOM.

55
00:02:53,313 --> 00:02:54,915
SHE RUSHED ME OUT OF THE HOUSE SO FAST

56
00:02:54,948 --> 00:02:56,950
I DIDN'T GET TO READ MY NEW E-MAIL.

57
00:02:56,984 --> 00:02:59,486
I HOPE IT'S FROM JORDAN.

58
00:03:06,026 --> 00:03:07,661
THAT SUCKS ABOUT THE E-MAIL.

59
00:03:07,694 --> 00:03:10,631
I KNOW. BUT JORDAN E-MAILED ME LAST NIGHT TOO.

60
00:03:10,664 --> 00:03:14,501
REALLY? WHAT DID HE SAY?

61
00:03:14,535 --> 00:03:16,970
I GOT OVER 6000 NAMES ON MY PETITION TO

62
00:03:17,004 --> 00:03:20,274
KEEP THE POLAR WILDLIFE REFUGE UNTOUCHED.

63
00:03:20,307 --> 00:03:21,875
THANKS FOR YOUR HELP WITH ALL THIS EM

64
00:03:21,909 --> 00:03:23,443
AND FOR YOUR GREAT IDEA.

65
00:03:23,477 --> 00:03:25,412
YOU'RE THE BEST.

66
00:03:25,445 --> 00:03:27,014
WOW.

67
00:03:27,047 --> 00:03:29,683
I SUGGESTED THE PETITION BUT JORDAN DID ALL THE WORK.

68
00:03:29,716 --> 00:03:30,584
HE'S SO COMMITTED.

69
00:03:30,617 --> 00:03:34,221
TOO BAD HE LIVES IN YELLOWKNIFE.

70
00:03:34,588 --> 00:03:35,856
HELP! UGH!

71
00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:37,524
J.T.!

72
00:03:48,468 --> 00:03:51,505
PEOPLE IN THE EIGHTIES WERE WEIRD.

73
00:03:55,309 --> 00:03:58,011
THIS CAR IS RETRO MEETS MODERNISM, LUCY.

74
00:03:58,045 --> 00:03:59,379
IT'S GOT THE ZING OF THE PAST

75
00:03:59,413 --> 00:04:01,014
WITH THE TECHNOLOGY OF THE FUTURE.

76
00:04:01,048 --> 00:04:02,883
I MEAN IT'S EVEN GOT THE LITTLE BUD VASE

77
00:04:02,916 --> 00:04:07,287
THAT YOU CAN PUT THE FLOWER IN. PEACE, MAN. HIPPY.

78
00:04:07,321 --> 00:04:10,891
JOEY, IDEALLY I'D LIKE A CAR THAT'S BIGGER THAN MY LAPTOP.

79
00:04:10,924 --> 00:04:12,859
I HAVE TO MOVE TO NEW MEXICO IN THIS THING.

80
00:04:12,893 --> 00:04:15,562
THIS CAR IS A LOT BIGGER THAN IT LOOKS, LUCY. TRUST ME, OKAY?

81
00:04:15,596 --> 00:04:17,564
WHY DON'T WE TAKE IT FOR A SPIN?

82
00:04:17,598 --> 00:04:18,632
WE'LL DROP YOUR STUFF OFF AT DEGRASSI

83
00:04:18,665 --> 00:04:20,934
AND WHEN WE GET BACK HERE, YOU'LL BE BEGGING ME.

84
00:04:20,968 --> 00:04:22,836
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.

85
00:04:22,869 --> 00:04:24,705
TELL ME THAT'S NOT ANGELA.

86
00:04:24,738 --> 00:04:25,839
YEAH!

87
00:04:25,872 --> 00:04:29,810
HEY CUTIE, YOU'RE PRACTICALLY A TEENAGER.

88
00:04:29,843 --> 00:04:31,011
YOU SAY, HI LUCY.

89
00:04:31,044 --> 00:04:31,311
HI.

90
00:04:31,878 --> 00:04:32,346
HI.

91
00:04:33,347 --> 00:04:34,348
SHE STARTS KINDERGARTEN NEXT WEEK.

92
00:04:34,381 --> 00:04:35,482
CAN YOU BELIEVE IT?

93
00:04:35,515 --> 00:04:36,483
IT'S GOING TO BE GREAT.

94
00:04:36,516 --> 00:04:38,485
SHE REALLY NEEDS TO BE AROUND OTHER PEOPLE.

95
00:04:38,518 --> 00:04:40,587
SPEAKING OF MEETING OTHER PEOPLE,

96
00:04:40,621 --> 00:04:43,056
I CHECKED THE REUNION WEBSITE LAST NIGHT.

97
00:04:43,090 --> 00:04:44,057
YOU'RE NOT CONFIRMED.

98
00:04:44,091 --> 00:04:45,592
I KNOW. I KNOW.

99
00:04:45,626 --> 00:04:48,095
JOEY, WE'RE ALL SORRY THAT YOUR WIFE DIED.

100
00:04:48,128 --> 00:04:49,863
BUT IT'S BEEN A YEAR.

101
00:04:50,464 --> 00:04:52,699
I THINK THAT JULIA WOULD BE UPSET IF SHE THOUGHT

102
00:04:52,733 --> 00:04:54,901
YOU WERE CUTTING YOURSELF OFF FROM PEOPLE.

103
00:04:54,935 --> 00:04:57,571
CAN WE AH - WHY DON'T I GOT IN,

104
00:04:57,604 --> 00:05:00,007
GET THE KEYS AND WE'LL GO FOR A SPIN, OKAY?

105
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:01,575
ANGELA, YOU WANT TO GO FOR A SPIN? YEAH?

106
00:05:01,608 --> 00:05:04,444
WE'RE GONNA SELL LUCY A CAR. YEAH.

107
00:05:15,122 --> 00:05:17,524
I REALLY HOPE YOU'RE MR. SIMPSON.

108
00:05:17,557 --> 00:05:21,094
I AM. AND YOU MUST BE EMMA. WOW. WOW!

109
00:05:24,064 --> 00:05:27,668
SPIKE FOUND ALL THIS STUFF? IT'S AMAZING.

110
00:05:28,135 --> 00:05:28,969
SPIKE!?

111
00:05:29,002 --> 00:05:32,372
MY MOM'S NICKNAME. DON'T ASK.

112
00:05:34,074 --> 00:05:37,077
AND I CAN SEE FEDORAS ARE MAKING A COMEBACK.

113
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:39,613
GREAT. THANKS A LOT, GUYS.

114
00:05:39,646 --> 00:05:44,351
LISTEN, GO IN AND ENJOY YOUR LAST FEW DAYS OF FREEDOM.

115
00:05:45,052 --> 00:05:46,119
SPIKE? OW!

116
00:05:47,554 --> 00:05:48,522
HEY GUYS, NO RUNNING.

117
00:05:48,555 --> 00:05:51,491
NO, NO RUNNING. OKAY, NO, JUST KEEP RUNNING.

118
00:05:51,525 --> 00:05:53,126
DON'T LISTEN TO ME.

119
00:05:56,663 --> 00:05:59,833
BOY. LOOK AT ALL THE COMPUTERS.

120
00:06:03,103 --> 00:06:05,505
EMMA LET'S GO. OH I SEE.

121
00:06:06,773 --> 00:06:08,008
YOU'RE GONNA E-MAIL JORDAN FROM HERE?

122
00:06:08,041 --> 00:06:09,609
SHUT UP!

123
00:06:09,643 --> 00:06:12,879
OH, HE CAN READ INTO MY SOUL. OW!

124
00:06:12,913 --> 00:06:14,481
AND THE JEWEL IN THE DEGRASSI FAMILY,

125
00:06:14,514 --> 00:06:16,516
THE MEDIA IMMERSION LAB.

126
00:06:17,017 --> 00:06:18,852
EVERY COMPUTER HERE IS CONNECTED

127
00:06:18,885 --> 00:06:21,421
TO THE INTERNET VIA HIGH SPEED TELEPHONE ACCESS.

128
00:06:21,455 --> 00:06:23,657
OH, YOU SEE TOBY. YOU DIDN'T HAVE THAT IN YOUR OLD SCHOOL.

129
00:06:23,690 --> 00:06:24,091
TOBY?

130
00:06:24,825 --> 00:06:25,292

I THINK THEY'RE BEST FRIENDS.

135
00:06:35,102 --> 00:06:36,169
DUDE, WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE

136
00:06:36,203 --> 00:06:38,438
MY DAD MOVED IN WITH HIS GIRLFRIEND AND AH,

137
00:06:38,472 --> 00:06:40,207
DEGRASSI IS THE CLOSEST SCHOOL SO-

138
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,942
I THINK WE'LL LET YOU TWO GET REACQUAINTED

139
00:06:41,975 --> 00:06:43,677
AND YOUR FATHER AND I WILL FINISH FILLING OUT THE FORMS

140
00:06:43,710 --> 00:06:45,178

00:06:47,013 --> 00:06:48,448
I'M GONNA WALK HOME, OKAY?

00:06:52,486 --> 00:06:55,222
OH, SORRY. AH MANNY, EMMA,

00:06:55,255 --> 00:06:57,624

NO, REALLY?

147
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,928
AH, NICE TO MEET YOU.

148
00:07:01,962 --> 00:07:05,165
YEAH. OKAY THE COAST IS FINALLY CLEAR.

149
00:07:05,198 --> 00:07:06,133
MANNY, YOU'RE COMING IN WITH ME.

00:07:06,166 --> 00:07:07,467
NO. NO, NO.!

151
00:07:07,501 --> 00:07:09,569

00:07:10,771 --> 00:07:13,507
SO, IS YOUR FRIEND ALWAYS LIKE THAT?

153
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:14,608

00:07:14,641 --> 00:07:15,909
REALLY?

155
00:07:15,942 --> 00:07:16,943
BOO!

156
00:07:18,612 --> 00:07:19,546
KIDS...

157
00:07:37,998 --> 00:07:40,734
KEITH, I KNOW YOU'RE REALLY OVERWORKED RIGHT NOW

158
00:07:40,767 --> 00:07:43,737
BUT THIS WEEKEND IS REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT TO ME.

159
00:07:43,770 --> 00:07:46,039
COME ON IT'S JUST ONE WEEKEND.

160
00:07:46,072 --> 00:07:49,142
I WANT TO SHOW YOU OFF. SHOW US OFF.

161
00:07:49,176 --> 00:07:51,244
PLEEEASE?

162
00:07:51,278 --> 00:07:53,814
YEAH THAT'S PERFECT. GREAT.

163
00:07:53,847 --> 00:07:56,817
FIVE O'CLOCK. THANKS BABE.

164
00:07:56,850 --> 00:07:58,852
I LOVE YOU TOO.

165
00:08:05,859 --> 00:08:07,794
THANKS.

166
00:08:19,773 --> 00:08:20,073
SNAKE!

167
00:08:21,408 --> 00:08:26,847
CAITLIN? OH! WOW! HEY! HMM. OH, IT'S GREAT TO SEE YOU.

168
00:08:29,049 --> 00:08:33,053
LIKEWISE. SO YOU'RE A TEACHER AT DEGRASSI. HERE.

169
00:08:36,223 --> 00:08:40,093
OKAY. NOW THIS IS YOUR GREATEST MEMORY OF DEGRASSI.

170
00:08:40,126 --> 00:08:43,930
WHAT!? SO I WENT THROUGH A HEADBAND PHASE.

171
00:08:43,964 --> 00:08:45,098
COME ON IT WAS THE EIGHTIES - YOU WERE THERE.

172
00:08:45,131 --> 00:08:48,001
OH, SPEAKING OF THE EIGHTIES, HOW ABOUT THIS?

173
00:08:48,034 --> 00:08:48,101
OH.

174
00:08:49,035 --> 00:08:50,036
JOEY'S FEDORA.

175
00:08:50,070 --> 00:08:51,137
OKAY.

176
00:08:51,972 --> 00:08:53,707
NICE, NICE. IT SUITS YOU.

177
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:54,808
WHERE'S THE SHIRT?

178
00:08:54,841 --> 00:08:55,642
I DON'T KNOW.

179
00:08:55,675 --> 00:08:58,578
I THINK JOEY IS STILL WEARING IT.

180
00:09:00,981 --> 00:09:02,649
OH, LOOK AT THAT.

181
00:09:02,682 --> 00:09:04,885

00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:22,135
MANNY, WOULD YOU CALM DOWN.

184
00:09:22,168 --> 00:09:24,104

185
00:09:24,137 --> 00:09:25,605
UH-HUH.

186
00:09:28,642 --> 00:09:29,910
WHAT? WHAT'D HE SAY?

187
00:09:29,943 --> 00:09:32,946
MANNY, JORDAN IS COMING HERE.

188
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:36,816
AND HE WANTS TO MEET ME. TOMORROW.

189
00:09:42,222 --> 00:09:43,757
SO WHAT'S YOUR DINOSAUR'S NAME?

190
00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:43,990
ALLY.

191
00:09:44,824 --> 00:09:45,225
ALLY?

192
00:09:46,326 --> 00:09:49,296
SO YOU'RE GETTING MARRIED. CONGRATULATIONS.

193
00:09:49,329 --> 00:09:51,631
YEAH. WHEN'S THE BIG DAY?

194
00:09:51,665 --> 00:09:54,801
SOME TIME NEXT YEAR. WE HAVEN'T NARROWED IT DOWN YET.

195
00:09:54,834 --> 00:09:56,736
BUT AH, YOU'RE ALL INVITED.

196
00:09:56,770 --> 00:09:58,772
GREAT. SO WHEN DO WE ACTUALLY GET TO MEET KEITH?

197
00:09:58,805 --> 00:10:00,874
HE'S ON AN AFTERNOON FLIGHT FROM L.A.

198
00:10:00,907 --> 00:10:02,309
HE'S DYING TO MEET YOU GUYS.

199
00:10:02,342 --> 00:10:04,744
L.A.? IS HE IN SHOW BUSINESS?

200
00:10:04,778 --> 00:10:07,113
MHM. HE'S A DIRECTOR.

201
00:10:07,147 --> 00:10:10,684
I ALWAYS KNEW YOU'D MEET THE GUY.

202
00:10:15,255 --> 00:10:17,924
WELL, I GUESS AH I SHOULD PROBABLY GO --

203
00:10:17,958 --> 00:10:19,826
CHECK INTO MY HOTEL.

204
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:23,029
AH, BUT JOEY, THE REUNION?

205
00:10:23,897 --> 00:10:25,231
YOU'RE REALLY NOT GOING TO GO?

206
00:10:25,265 --> 00:10:26,866
NO, I'M NOT.

207
00:10:28,234 --> 00:10:31,338
WELL THEN AT LEAST COME OUT FOR DRINKS WITH US TONIGHT.

208
00:10:31,371 --> 00:10:32,572
I AH-

209
00:10:32,606 --> 00:10:35,675
YOU KNOW WHAT? HE'D LOVE TO. WE'LL BOTH BE THERE.

210
00:10:35,709 --> 00:10:39,245
GREAT. ALL RIGHT. SO I'LL SEE YOU GUYS LATER THEN.

211
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:40,880
BYE CAITLIN.

212
00:10:46,786 --> 00:10:48,788
I WANT TO MEET HIM. IT'S JUST -

213
00:10:48,822 --> 00:10:51,091
I TOLD HIM I WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL.

214
00:10:51,124 --> 00:10:52,292
YOU ALMOST ARE.

215
00:10:52,325 --> 00:10:56,363
IF JORDAN IS COMING HERE YOU HAVE TO MEET HIM. IT'S FATE.

216
00:10:56,396 --> 00:10:57,230
WHO'S JORDAN?

217
00:10:57,263 --> 00:10:58,732
SOME CREEP EMMA MET ON THE NET.

218
00:10:58,765 --> 00:11:01,735
I BET HE LIVES IN SCARBOROUGH AND WORKS AT A VIDEO STORE.

219
00:11:01,768 --> 00:11:03,136
I BET HE'S 40 AND DROOLS.

220
00:11:03,169 --> 00:11:04,004
YOU STILL WET THE BED,

221
00:11:04,037 --> 00:11:05,405
BUT I'M FRIENDS WITH YOU.

222
00:11:05,438 --> 00:11:06,172
HA-HA-HA.

223
00:11:06,973 --> 00:11:09,309
OKAY, IF YOU'RE MEETING A STRANGER

224
00:11:09,342 --> 00:11:12,812
YOU MET OFF THE NET THAT CAN BE REALLY DANGEROUS.

225
00:11:12,846 --> 00:11:13,980
HE'S NOT A STRANGER.

226
00:11:14,014 --> 00:11:15,782
HE E-MAILED ME HIS PICTURE.

227
00:11:15,815 --> 00:11:19,152
I'VE KNOWN JORDAN A LOT LONGER THAN I'VE KNOWN YOU.

228
00:11:19,185 --> 00:11:20,920
GUYS, IT'S COOL.

229
00:11:20,954 --> 00:11:23,957
JORDAN IS 16. HE'S COMING HERE ON A SCHOOL TRIP.

230
00:11:23,990 --> 00:11:25,925
SCHOOL TRIP? IT'S SUMMER.

231
00:11:25,959 --> 00:11:27,394
THEY ORGANIZED IT BACK IN THE SPRING.

232
00:11:27,427 --> 00:11:29,129
HE GOT TO GO THE LAST MINUTE.

233
00:11:29,162 --> 00:11:31,865
QUIT MAKING THIS INTO SOMETHING IT'S NOT.

234
00:11:31,898 --> 00:11:32,298
OKAY.

235
00:11:34,801 --> 00:11:35,735
(SCREAMS)

236
00:11:41,441 --> 00:11:42,742
(GIGGLING)

237
00:11:42,776 --> 00:11:44,110
OH MY GOD.

238
00:11:45,011 --> 00:11:46,446
WAIT WAIT WAIT. GO BACK.

239
00:11:46,479 --> 00:11:48,114
I WANT TO SEE THAT ONE AGAIN.

240
00:11:48,148 --> 00:11:49,783
DON'T TRY AND SPEED PAST THAT ONE.

241
00:11:49,816 --> 00:11:50,884
(LAUGHTER)

242
00:11:50,917 --> 00:11:52,752
I CAN'T WAIT TO MEET KEITH.

243
00:11:52,786 --> 00:11:54,954
HE'S GOT GREAT TASTE IN JEWELRY.

244
00:11:54,988 --> 00:11:56,823
THAT'S A GOOD SIGN.

245
00:11:56,856 --> 00:11:58,324
WELL THANK YOU.

246
00:11:58,458 --> 00:12:02,262
UMM, ACTUALLY I PICKED IT OUT MYSELF.

247
00:12:02,295 --> 00:12:05,265
CAUSE HE... YOU KNOW HE WAS SO BUSY WITH PRE-PRODUCTION

248
00:12:05,298 --> 00:12:07,934
AND ALL THAT KIND OF STUFF HE JUST GAVE ME HIS CARD

249
00:12:07,967 --> 00:12:09,803
AND SAID GO CRAZY.

250
00:12:09,836 --> 00:12:12,772
CAN'T COMPLAIN ABOUT CRAZY.

251
00:12:12,806 --> 00:12:14,140
WHY ARE YOU ON MY COMPUTER?

252
00:12:14,174 --> 00:12:16,376
EXCUSE ME. OUR COMPUTER.

253
00:12:16,409 --> 00:12:18,078
YOU'RE ON THE REUNION SITE AGAIN?

254
00:12:18,111 --> 00:12:20,847
NEXT TIME CAN WE TRY ASKING BEFORE TRESPASSING?

255
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:24,384
NEXT TIME COULD WE BE MORE POLITE TO OUR GUEST? EM?

256
00:12:24,417 --> 00:12:26,252
CAITLIN RYAN! RYAN'S PLANET!

257
00:12:26,286 --> 00:12:28,521

AND YOU'RE A STALKER.

260
00:12:31,024 --> 00:12:33,259
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU'RE ACTUALLY HERE!

261
00:12:33,293 --> 00:12:35,562
IN MY REALLY MESSY ROOM...

262
00:12:35,595 --> 00:12:37,063
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

263
00:12:37,097 --> 00:12:39,265
OH MY GOD IT'S GREAT TO SEE YOU!

264
00:12:39,299 --> 00:12:40,233
ALL GROWN UP.

265
00:12:40,266 --> 00:12:42,302
SHE WISHES.

266
00:12:42,335 --> 00:12:46,005
SO, EXPECTING AN EMAIL FROM YOUR BOYFRIEND?

267
00:12:46,039 --> 00:12:48,408
DID YOU? YOU HACKED MY EMAIL?

268
00:12:48,441 --> 00:12:50,243
HAVEN'T YOU EVER HEARD OF PRIVACY?

269
00:12:50,276 --> 00:12:53,513
RELAX! I COULDN'T HACK MY WAY OUT OF A PAPER BAG!

270
00:12:53,546 --> 00:12:54,914
BUT I CAN TELL WHEN MY DAUGHTER'S

271
00:12:54,948 --> 00:12:56,783
GETTING INTERESTED IN BOYS.

272
00:12:57,117 --> 00:13:00,553
MOM, I'M NOT HAVING SEX.

273
00:13:00,587 --> 00:13:03,089
I'M GOING TO HAVE FUN THIS WEEKEND RIGHT?

274
00:13:03,123 --> 00:13:06,292
I PROMISE. (CHUCKLE)

275
00:13:07,594 --> 00:13:09,195
BYE.

276
00:13:13,466 --> 00:13:14,968
OKAY WE'VE GONE THROUGH ALL THE E-MAIL.

277
00:13:15,001 --> 00:13:18,471
NO VIDEO STORE. NO MENTION OF MISSING TEETH.

278
00:13:18,505 --> 00:13:19,973
J.T. IS JUST WORRIED ABOUT YOU

279
00:13:20,006 --> 00:13:22,408
J.T. IS JUST IMMATURE.

280
00:13:22,942 --> 00:13:25,345
THAT TOBY GUY SEEMS OKAY.

281
00:13:25,378 --> 00:13:28,047
HE'S FINE I GUESS. YOUNG.

282
00:13:29,015 --> 00:13:31,384
GIRLS ARE SO MUCH MORE MATURE THAN BOYS.

283
00:13:31,417 --> 00:13:33,486
THAT'S WHY I LIKE JORDAN.

284
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:35,989
I'VE NEVER HAD A BOYFRIEND -

285
00:13:36,022 --> 00:13:38,091
SO SMART - SO THOUGHTFUL.

286
00:13:39,425 --> 00:13:41,461
AND YOU'VE NEVER HAD A BOYFRIEND.

287
00:13:41,494 --> 00:13:42,862
I KNOW.

288
00:13:44,330 --> 00:13:45,098
MAYBE...

289
00:13:45,131 --> 00:13:46,132
WHAT?

290
00:13:47,667 --> 00:13:50,937
WHAT TOBY SAID, ABOUT MEETING STRANGERS ON THE NET

291
00:13:50,970 --> 00:13:52,338
BEING DANGEROUS.

292
00:13:52,372 --> 00:13:53,540
MANNY, I CAN TAKE CARE OF MYSELF.

293
00:13:53,573 --> 00:13:55,041
YOU DON'T NEED TO WORRY SO MUCH.

294
00:13:55,074 --> 00:13:58,044
WE'LL MEET SOMEWHERE PUBLIC.

295
00:13:58,077 --> 00:14:00,180
MAYBE YOU SHOULD JUST TALK TO YOUR MOM. SHE'S COOL.

296
00:14:00,213 --> 00:14:01,247
SHE'D UNDERSTAND.

297
00:14:01,281 --> 00:14:03,550
SHE'S NOT THAT COOL.

298
00:14:05,618 --> 00:14:10,156
ARE YOU SAYING YOU DON'T THINK I SHOULD MEET JORDAN?

299
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:17,964
WOW TEACHING IS SO NOBLE.

300
00:14:17,997 --> 00:14:22,068
GIVING BACK ETC. ACTUALLY I'M WORKING ON A SCRIPT

301
00:14:24,204 --> 00:14:25,305
ABOUT YOU GUYS.

302
00:14:25,338 --> 00:14:28,174
KIND OF A DANGEROUS MINDS MEETS FOOTLOOSE KIND OF THING.

303
00:14:28,208 --> 00:14:29,475
(KEITH'S CELL PHONE RINGS)

304
00:14:29,509 --> 00:14:31,077
JUST - JUST A SECOND.

305
00:14:31,110 --> 00:14:33,279
I HAVE TO TAKE THIS.

306
00:14:33,313 --> 00:14:35,014
YO, FRANKIE. YEAH.

307
00:14:36,182 --> 00:14:37,483
NO I'M IN TORONTO.

308
00:14:39,285 --> 00:14:42,589
NO, I HAVEN'T SEEN ANY ESKIMOS YET. AH NO...

309
00:14:44,257 --> 00:14:46,292
CAITLIN, I WATCH YOUR SHOW EVERY WEEK.

310
00:14:46,326 --> 00:14:49,128
THE SITUATIONS YOU GET YOURSELF INTO.

311
00:14:49,162 --> 00:14:50,997
YOU'RE AMAZINGLY BRAVE.

312
00:14:51,030 --> 00:14:53,600
BRAVE? SO WHAT ABOUT YOU?

313
00:14:53,633 --> 00:14:54,467
WHAT ABOUT ME?

314
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:56,169
OH COME ON, DON'T BE SO MODEST.

315
00:14:56,202 --> 00:14:58,204
TWO YEARS OF PHYSICAL THERAPY,

316
00:14:58,238 --> 00:15:01,207
FOLLOWED BY AN HONOURS B.A. AND A MASTERS IN ANTHROPOLOGY.

317
00:15:01,241 --> 00:15:03,376
PHD IN ONE MORE YEAR.

318
00:15:03,409 --> 00:15:04,811
GUYS, THAT'S NOT BRAVE.

319
00:15:04,844 --> 00:15:09,649
NO, YOU'RE RIGHT. IT'S JUST BRILLIANT, AWESOME, AMAZING.

320
00:15:09,682 --> 00:15:12,719
IT'S NOT EVEN AWESOME. IT'S JUST - LIFE.

321
00:15:12,752 --> 00:15:15,421
I SURVIVED THE ACCIDENT. I GOT OFF EASY.

322
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:17,323
SORT OF LIKE WHEELS.

323
00:15:17,357 --> 00:15:20,560
KILLS A KID. TEN YEARS LATER - SCOT FREE.

324
00:15:23,396 --> 00:15:24,564
HEY WE GOT WHITE ONES,

325
00:15:24,597 --> 00:15:26,099
WE GOT RED ONES, WE GOT BIG ONES AND WE GOT SMALL ONES -

326
00:15:26,132 --> 00:15:28,067
OH NO, GREAT!

327
00:15:29,335 --> 00:15:31,337
THAT'S RIGHT. AT JEREMIAH MOTORS,

328
00:15:31,371 --> 00:15:32,438
IF YOU FIND A LOWER PRICE ANYWHERE ELSE,

329
00:15:32,472 --> 00:15:35,241
I'LL GIVE YOU THE SHIRT OFF MY BACK!

330
00:15:35,275 --> 00:15:36,109
(LAUGHTER)

331
00:15:42,482 --> 00:15:44,050
JOEY THAT'S AWFUL!

332
00:15:44,083 --> 00:15:46,252
I NEEDED A COMMERCIAL, SO I MADE A COMMERCIAL.

333
00:15:46,286 --> 00:15:48,421
RIGHT ON, MAN. IT MAKES OR BREAKS A BUSINESS.

334
00:15:48,454 --> 00:15:50,256
JUST HOLD ON A SECOND.

335
00:15:50,290 --> 00:15:53,426
FRANKIE, LISTEN. LISTEN TO ME.

336
00:15:53,459 --> 00:15:54,694
THEY'RE FROM A MAJOR.

337
00:15:54,727 --> 00:15:57,697
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO SIGN A DEAL ON SOME LOW RENT PANCAKE HOUSE.

338
00:15:57,730 --> 00:16:00,600
FIX IT, OKAY?

339
00:16:00,633 --> 00:16:03,469
BUT JOEY, NEXT TIME - HIRE A REAL ACTOR.

340
00:16:06,372 --> 00:16:10,243
AVOID THIS SHIFTY USED CAR SALESMAN VIBE.

341
00:16:10,276 --> 00:16:11,344
OH.

342
00:16:11,377 --> 00:16:13,179
I MEAN THAT'S WHAT I WOULD DO.

343
00:16:13,212 --> 00:16:14,514
NO THANK YOU, KEITH.

344
00:16:14,547 --> 00:16:17,383
NO PROBLEM. THAT'S WHAT THEY PAY ME THE BIG BUCKS FOR.

345
00:16:17,417 --> 00:16:19,752
IT'S FUNNY, IT'S CLASSIC, IT'S-

346
00:16:19,786 --> 00:16:21,220
IT'S JOEY.

347
00:16:21,254 --> 00:16:22,522
JOEY, YES.

348
00:16:22,555 --> 00:16:24,757
KEITH, IF YOU HAD SEEN JOEY THROUGH HIGH SCHOOL,

349
00:16:24,791 --> 00:16:26,793
WHOLE HAM, THE WHOLE WAY THROUGH.

350
00:16:26,826 --> 00:16:27,560
I BET.

351
00:16:27,593 --> 00:16:28,594
I THINK IT'S GREAT!

352
00:16:28,628 --> 00:16:30,330
I MEAN DESPITE EVERYTHING YOU'VE BEEN THROUGH,

353
00:16:30,363 --> 00:16:33,166
YOU'RE STILL THE SAME OLD JOEY.

354
00:16:34,434 --> 00:16:39,439
ACTUALLY, AH I HAVE CHANGED. AND SO IF YOU EXCUSE ME...

355
00:16:45,712 --> 00:16:46,446
SO-

356
00:16:51,184 --> 00:16:53,286
CAN WE GET TWO MORE OF THOSE? THANKS.

357
00:16:53,319 --> 00:16:54,687
JOEY, WE'RE OVER THERE RIGHT NOW.

358
00:16:54,721 --> 00:16:57,657
YEAH, I KNOW. I'M JUST WAITING FOR MY CAB.

359
00:16:57,690 --> 00:16:58,825
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?

360
00:16:58,858 --> 00:17:00,393
NOTHING'S GOING ON. I KNEW THIS WAS A BAD IDEA

361
00:17:00,426 --> 00:17:01,661
SO I'M GOING HOME.

362
00:17:01,694 --> 00:17:02,795
JOEY, COME BACK.

363
00:17:02,829 --> 00:17:06,466
SNAKE, GET OFF MY BACK. PLEASE, DON'T START!

364
00:17:06,499 --> 00:17:07,600
YOU KNOW, CUTTING OUT THE REST OF THE WORLD

365
00:17:07,633 --> 00:17:10,336
IS NOT GOING TO BRING HER BACK. YOU KNOW THAT, RIGHT?

366
00:17:10,370 --> 00:17:12,605
YOU SAVE THE PSYCH 101 CRAP FOR YOUR STUDENTS.

367
00:17:12,638 --> 00:17:14,540
I'M NOT A CHILD. I DON'T NEED YOU OR ANYONE ELSE TELLING ME

368
00:17:14,574 --> 00:17:15,775
HOW TO LIVE MY LIFE!

369
00:17:15,808 --> 00:17:16,909
JOEY, WE'RE YOUR FRIENDS. WE'RE WORRIED ABOUT YOU.

370
00:17:16,943 --> 00:17:19,479
ALL I GET ARE PEOPLE FEELING SORRY FOR ME.

371
00:17:19,512 --> 00:17:20,680
WHY DO YOU THINK I DON'T WANT TO GO TOMORROW NIGHT.

372
00:17:20,713 --> 00:17:23,349
IT JUST MAKES ME FEEL WORSE.

373
00:17:23,383 --> 00:17:24,751
SO THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH CAITLIN.

374
00:17:24,784 --> 00:17:28,855
NO! NO IT DOESN'T! ALL RIGHT? I DON'T LIKE HER BOYFRIEND.

375
00:17:28,888 --> 00:17:29,222
FIANCE.

376
00:17:29,255 --> 00:17:30,356
WHATEVER.

377
00:17:30,390 --> 00:17:33,092
AND I DON'T LIKE THE FACT THAT SHE FEELS SORRY FOR ME.

378
00:17:33,126 --> 00:17:34,193
BUT I'M FINE. FRANKLY,

379
00:17:34,227 --> 00:17:38,164
I AM SICK AND TIRED OF EVERYONE TRYING TO - SAVE ME.

380
00:17:39,432 --> 00:17:41,100
YOU KNOW WHAT?

381
00:17:41,134 --> 00:17:45,538
I'D LOOK AND SEE WHO'S FEELING SORRY FOR YOU RIGHT NOW.

382
00:18:01,754 --> 00:18:05,758
(SINGING)

383
00:18:21,441 --> 00:18:25,311
WE STILL KNOW THE WORDS. GOD HELP US.

384
00:18:25,344 --> 00:18:26,646
WHO WANTS A GLASS OF CHAMPAGNE?

385
00:18:26,679 --> 00:18:27,680
I DO!

386
00:18:27,713 --> 00:18:30,883
HEY, CAN WE SPIKE YOUR HAIR NOW?

387
00:18:30,917 --> 00:18:31,884
NEVER.

388
00:18:32,919 --> 00:18:34,921
OH COME ON. THE EIGHTIES ARE BACK.

389
00:18:34,954 --> 00:18:38,891
BESIDES THE GOGAS HAVE REUNITED. COME ON.

390
00:18:39,826 --> 00:18:41,694
EMMA, WE WOKE YOU UP.

391
00:18:41,727 --> 00:18:43,596
SORRY. SORRY, EMMA.

392
00:18:43,629 --> 00:18:45,298
WE PROMISE TO BE QUITE.

393
00:18:45,331 --> 00:18:46,632
LADIES, BUBBLY?

394
00:18:46,666 --> 00:18:49,569
JUST ONE GLASS THOUGH, OKAY?

395
00:18:49,602 --> 00:18:51,337
KEITH'S WAITING FOR ME BACK AT THE HOTEL.

396
00:18:51,370 --> 00:18:52,872
CAN I HELP?

397
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:59,178
HEY, EMMA! HOW ARE YOU?

398
00:18:59,212 --> 00:19:01,714
IT'S SO GOOD TO SEE YOU.

399
00:19:01,747 --> 00:19:05,284
CAITLIN, CAN I ASK YOU SOMETHING?

400
00:19:05,384 --> 00:19:09,255
SURE. LET ME GUESS. YOUR BOYFRIEND?

401
00:19:09,288 --> 00:19:11,891
MY FRIENDS DON'T THINK I SHOULD BE WITH HIM.

402
00:19:11,924 --> 00:19:14,594
WELL WHAT DO YOU THINK? I MEAN DO YOU LIKE HIM?

403
00:19:14,627 --> 00:19:18,698
YEAH, WE GET ALONG SO GREAT. SOMETIMES,

404
00:19:18,731 --> 00:19:21,934
IT'S LIKE HE CAN READ INTO MY SOUL.

405
00:19:21,968 --> 00:19:25,738
WELL SOMETIMES, THEN YOU JUST HAVE TO TAKE CHANCE.

406
00:19:25,771 --> 00:19:26,606
GO FOR IT.

407
00:19:27,607 --> 00:19:29,375
EVEN IF YOUR FRIENDS DON'T THINK IT'S RIGHT.

408
00:19:29,408 --> 00:19:31,544
LIKE WHAT YOU DO FOR THE ENVIRONMENT?

409
00:19:31,577 --> 00:19:34,614
YEAH, EXACTLY. IF MY FAMILY HAD THEIR WAY,

410
00:19:34,647 --> 00:19:36,449
I'D BE WORKING IN AN OFFICE RIGHT NOW

411
00:19:36,482 --> 00:19:38,484
SOMEWHERE ON BAY STREET.

412
00:19:38,985 --> 00:19:41,354
OH, WHAT AN AWFUL THOUGHT.

413
00:19:43,923 --> 00:19:45,892
SO IS HE CUTE?

414
00:19:45,925 --> 00:19:51,931
COME ON! I WANT DETAILS! DETAILS DETAILS!

415
00:19:51,964 --> 00:19:54,600
SPIKE, WHAT DO YOU THINK OF KEITH?

416
00:19:54,634 --> 00:19:55,568
CAITLIN COULD DO A LOT BETTER.

417
00:19:55,601 --> 00:19:57,303
NO KIDDING.

418
00:20:01,908 --> 00:20:06,979
BUT HOW DO YOU KNOW? I MEAN WHEN IT'S ONE OF THOSE TIMES?

419
00:20:07,013 --> 00:20:10,550
WELL YOU KNOW IN HERE. AND IT'S USUALLY RIGHT.

420
00:20:10,583 --> 00:20:12,785
OOPS. BONDING MOMENT?

421
00:20:12,818 --> 00:20:15,454
OH NO, NO, JUST BORING EMMA WITH TALES

422
00:20:15,488 --> 00:20:17,490
OF MY ENVIRONMENTAL CRUSADES.

423
00:20:17,523 --> 00:20:19,692
WHAT YOU SAID, WOW!

424
00:20:20,626 --> 00:20:22,662
HONEY, DO YOU WANT TO JOIN US FOR A MINUTE?

425
00:20:22,695 --> 00:20:24,630
NO. I'M TIRED.

426
00:20:25,998 --> 00:20:27,366
GOOD NIGHT.

427
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:28,868
GOOD NIGHT, EM.

428
00:20:28,901 --> 00:20:31,537
SO, WHAT WERE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

429
00:20:31,571 --> 00:20:34,907
OH, WOULDN'T YOU LIKE TO KNOW?

430
00:20:35,441 --> 00:20:37,777
OH! SHE'S SO YOUNG!

431
00:20:37,810 --> 00:20:39,645
OH AND YOU'RE SO OLD(!)

432
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:42,315
WHAT, I'M PRACTICALLY 30!

433
00:20:42,348 --> 00:20:44,951
I REFUSE TO HAVE THIS BIOLOGICAL CLOCK DISCUSSION.

434
00:20:44,984 --> 00:20:49,388
HONESTLY, I DON'T EVEN FEEL IT!

435
00:20:49,422 --> 00:20:50,623
I WOULDN'T MIND GOING OUT ON A DATE.

436
00:20:50,656 --> 00:20:52,992
OH MY GOD THAT'S THE BEST THING ABOUT KEITH!

437
00:20:53,025 --> 00:20:55,361
NO MORE FLIRTING WITH MEN IN SANDALS

438
00:20:55,394 --> 00:20:58,931
OVER ORGANIC FOOD AND ENVIRONMENTAL CHIT CHAT.

439
00:20:58,965 --> 00:21:02,468
POOR CAITLIN, SO MANY VEGANS SO LITTLE TIME.

440
00:21:20,987 --> 00:21:23,689
SOMETIMES YOU JUST -

441
00:21:26,025 --> 00:21:27,360
GO FOR IT.
