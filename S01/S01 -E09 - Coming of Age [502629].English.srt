1
00:00:03,043 --> 00:00:03,744
HEY.

2
00:00:06,213 --> 00:00:08,382
YOU KNOW, THE THING ABOUT TURNING 14-

3
00:00:08,415 --> 00:00:10,451
IT'S LIKE - I'M A MAN NOW.

4
00:00:10,484 --> 00:00:12,319
OH YEAH? IN WHAT COUNTRY?

5
00:00:12,353 --> 00:00:14,121
SO, WHERE ARE YOUR PARENTS TAKING YOU THIS YEAR JIMMY?

6
00:00:14,154 --> 00:00:15,789
ACTUALLY? MY MOM'S COOKING.

7
00:00:15,823 --> 00:00:17,624
NOW, IS THIS FOR REAL COOKING

8
00:00:17,658 --> 00:00:19,727
OR 'LET'S ORDER A PIZZA' COOKING?

9
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:22,663
FOR REAL COOKING. LOBSTER. FOR YOU, ME AND DAD.

10
00:00:22,696 --> 00:00:24,198
YOU MEAN, WE'RE ACTUALLY GOING TO HAVE DINNER

11
00:00:24,231 --> 00:00:25,799
WITH YOUR PARENTS? AT YOUR HOUSE?

12
00:00:25,833 --> 00:00:27,067
I DON'T BELIEVE IT.

13
00:00:27,101 --> 00:00:29,570
LOBSTER'S NO BIG DEAL. YOU JUST THROW 'EM IN A POT.

14
00:00:29,603 --> 00:00:32,539
AND THEN THEY DIE. SLOWLY SCREAMING.

15
00:00:32,573 --> 00:00:34,708
THANKS FOR SHARING.

16
00:00:36,477 --> 00:00:38,479
CATCH YOU LATER?

17
00:00:39,613 --> 00:00:42,616
WHAT? YOU HATE LOBSTER? YOU HATE HIS PARENTS?

18
00:00:42,649 --> 00:00:44,551
I DON'T HATE ANYBODY.

19
00:00:44,585 --> 00:00:45,819
AT LEAST IT'S NOT AT MY HOUSE.

20
00:00:45,853 --> 00:00:48,789
HE'S HAD DINNER WITH US EIGHT DAYS IN A ROW.

21
00:00:48,822 --> 00:00:49,857
I KNOW. POOR ME.

22
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:51,658
MY BOYFRIEND AND MY PARENTS ACTUALLY GET ALONG.

23
00:00:51,692 --> 00:00:54,161
YES. THAT MUST REALLY SUCK.

24
00:00:54,194 --> 00:00:56,263
IT'S JUST - I ALREADY HAVE A PSEUDO-BROTHER.

25
00:00:56,296 --> 00:00:58,732
I DON'T NEED ANOTHER ONE.

26
00:00:58,766 --> 00:01:00,768
♪ WHAT EVER IT TAKES

27
00:01:02,403 --> 00:01:05,239
♪ I KNOW I CAN MAKE IT THROUGH

28
00:01:07,775 --> 00:01:09,376
♪ IF I HOLD OUT

29
00:01:11,211 --> 00:01:13,847

32
00:01:22,322 --> 00:01:24,658
♪ HEAR WHAT I SAY TO YOU

33
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:27,761
♪ WHAT EVER IT TAKES

34
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:31,598
♪ I KNOW I CAN MAKE IT

35
00:01:33,767 --> 00:01:36,804
♪ I KNOW I CAN MAKE IT THROUGH

36
00:01:38,939 --> 00:01:41,909
WHEN YOU SEE YOUR MAN, DO YOU FEEL -A) INDIFFERENT

37
00:01:41,942 --> 00:01:43,210
B) NAUSEOUS

38
00:01:43,243 --> 00:01:44,378
C) RELIEVED,

39
00:01:44,411 --> 00:01:46,146
OR D) THE EARTH MOVE?

40
00:01:47,514 --> 00:01:48,682
UH - C. RELIEVED.

41
00:01:48,715 --> 00:01:50,784
HE'S A GUY. NOT AN EARTHQUAKE.

42
00:01:50,818 --> 00:01:54,855
WHAT, HE DOESN'T VIBRATE ON YOUR RICHTER SCALE?

43
00:01:54,888 --> 00:01:57,791
WHY DOES THAT SOUND SO GROSS?

44
00:01:57,825 --> 00:01:58,659
JIMMY, COME ON.

45
00:01:58,692 --> 00:02:00,561
WE'RE KIND OF - IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS.

46
00:02:00,594 --> 00:02:01,562
GO PLAY FOOTBALL.

47
00:02:01,595 --> 00:02:04,198
YOU DON'T WANT TO HEAR THIS STUFF. IT'S STUPID.

48
00:02:04,231 --> 00:02:06,533
HEY, JIMMY. YOU COMING OR WHAT?

49
00:02:06,567 --> 00:02:08,569
AND PASS UP A CHANCE TO HEAR MY GIRL'S INNER THOUGHTS?

50
00:02:08,602 --> 00:02:10,437
ARE YOU KIDDING?

51
00:02:13,207 --> 00:02:15,776
SO. YOU WANNA HANG OUT WITH MR. RIGHT TONIGHT?

52
00:02:15,809 --> 00:02:19,480
TONIGHT? I UH - CAN'T. TERRI'S COMING OVER.

53
00:02:20,347 --> 00:02:21,248
GIRLS' NIGHT.

54
00:02:21,281 --> 00:02:23,383
WE TALKED ABOUT IT YESTERDAY? REMEMBER?

55
00:02:23,417 --> 00:02:26,753
GIRLS' NIGHT, HUH. THAT'S COOL.

56
00:02:37,998 --> 00:02:39,800
I FOUND THE COOLEST SITE YESTERDAY.

57
00:02:39,833 --> 00:02:40,701
IT SHOWS HOW THE POSITION OF THE STARS

58
00:02:40,734 --> 00:02:42,369
AFFECTS YOUR PERSONALITY...

59
00:02:42,402 --> 00:02:44,371
YEAH. THAT'S CALLED ASTROLOGY.

60
00:02:44,404 --> 00:02:46,940
COOL! I'M A LEO - WHAT DOES IT SAY ABOUT ME?

61
00:02:46,974 --> 00:02:48,675
MANNY. HOW MANY MOONS ON JUPITER?

62
00:02:48,709 --> 00:02:50,210
I DON'T KNOW. A LOT.

63
00:02:50,244 --> 00:02:51,578
NOW, READ MINE -

64
00:02:51,945 --> 00:02:54,715
13, AND WHICH PLANETS HAVE RINGS?

65
00:02:54,748 --> 00:02:57,284
I NEED BIRTHDATE, AND YOUR PLACE OF BIRTH.

66
00:02:57,317 --> 00:02:58,986
WELL, I WAS BORN IN MANILA -

67
00:02:59,019 --> 00:03:02,589
HELLO, THE TEST'S ON ASTRONOMY, NOT ASTROLOGY.

68
00:03:02,623 --> 00:03:04,424
OKAY...NOW I NEED YOUR BIRTHDAY?

69
00:03:04,458 --> 00:03:06,960
DOESN'T ANYONE CARE THAT WE HAVE A SCIENCE QUIZ IN -

70
00:03:06,994 --> 00:03:08,962
OH, FIFTEEN MINUTES?

71
00:03:08,996 --> 00:03:11,798
AUGUST FIFTEENTH, 1989.

72
00:03:11,832 --> 00:03:14,835
BLAH BLAH BLAH. I CAN'T EVEN THINK!

73
00:03:15,736 --> 00:03:16,803
ARE YOU COMING?

74
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:20,474
I SAW THAT!

75
00:03:38,926 --> 00:03:39,927
(Bell Rings)

76
00:03:46,867 --> 00:03:49,369
I FAILED. I TOTALLY FAILED.

77
00:03:49,403 --> 00:03:51,638
EM, YOU STUDIED ALL LAST NIGHT!

78
00:03:51,672 --> 00:03:54,608
YEAH, BUT I WAS COUNTING ON HAVING THIS MORNING.

79
00:03:54,641 --> 00:03:55,576
TO REFRESH.

80
00:03:56,410 --> 00:03:58,345
WOW. MAYBE YOU'RE A WORKAHOLIC.

81
00:03:58,378 --> 00:04:00,314
I AM NOT A WORKAHOLIC.

82
00:04:01,048 --> 00:04:02,749
SOME OF US WANT TO MAKE IT TO UNIVERSITY.

83
00:04:02,783 --> 00:04:07,254
I WANT A CAREER IN SOMETHING OTHER THAN HOROSCOPES!

84
00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:11,758
I AM SO BEHIND IN KWAN'S CLASS.

85
00:04:11,792 --> 00:04:13,627
I SHOULD SPEND A NIGHT CATCHING UP.

86
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:14,761
YEAH, ME TOO, TER -

87
00:04:14,795 --> 00:04:16,697
BUT NOT TONIGHT.

88
00:04:16,730 --> 00:04:19,066
TONIGHT IS ALL ABOUT HAVING --

89
00:04:19,099 --> 00:04:20,901
LEAVE IT ALONE FOR A BIT, DON'T SUFFOCATE IT.

90
00:04:20,934 --> 00:04:22,636
IT'LL COME TO YOU.

91
00:04:24,504 --> 00:04:25,305
HEY.

92
00:04:25,339 --> 00:04:26,406
HEY.

93
00:04:28,976 --> 00:04:32,746
JUST - PRETEND I'M NOT EVEN HERE.

94
00:04:32,779 --> 00:04:35,716
SO MUCH FOR GIRLS NIGHT.

95
00:04:42,856 --> 00:04:44,891
PRETEND HE'S NOT HERE? HE IS HERE.

96
00:04:44,925 --> 00:04:46,360
HI, GIRLS.

97
00:04:46,393 --> 00:04:47,794
HI MOM.

98
00:04:47,828 --> 00:04:50,364
OH TERRI, I ALMOST FORGOT - YOU'RE STAYING FOR DINNER.

99
00:04:50,397 --> 00:04:52,699
WE HAVE ENOUGH. DON'T WE?

100
00:04:52,733 --> 00:04:54,668
YEAH, EVEN THOUGH JIMMY EATS LIKE A HORSE.

101
00:04:54,701 --> 00:04:55,702
MOM -

102
00:04:55,736 --> 00:04:56,970
IT'S OKAY, WE HAVE ENOUGH.

103
00:04:57,004 --> 00:05:00,540
JIMMY'S NOT STAYING FOR DINNER!

104
00:05:04,077 --> 00:05:07,014
UH- I'M GONNA GO- YOU KNOW.

105
00:05:10,884 --> 00:05:13,487
OKAY... WHAT'S GOING ON?

106
00:05:14,855 --> 00:05:16,023
NOTHING. I'M JUST -

107
00:05:16,056 --> 00:05:18,625
I'M SICK OF HIM EATING HERE, EVERY NIGHT.

108
00:05:18,659 --> 00:05:21,461
WELL, WE DON'T HAVE TO INVITE HIM.

109
00:05:21,495 --> 00:05:22,696
BUT, I JUST - I FEEL BAD FOR THE KID.

110
00:05:22,729 --> 00:05:24,531
HE'S ALWAYS ALONE.

111
00:05:24,931 --> 00:05:28,101
I WONDER ABOUT THE PARENTS SOMETIMES -

112
00:05:28,935 --> 00:05:30,837
HEY KATE, CAN JIMMY STAY FOR DINNER?

113
00:05:30,871 --> 00:05:32,739
YOU SAID WE HAD ENOUGH FOOD.

114
00:05:33,874 --> 00:05:34,708
WELL UM...

115
00:05:35,909 --> 00:05:37,978
JUST NEVER MIND. JUST FORGET ABOUT IT.

116
00:05:38,011 --> 00:05:38,945
IT'S FINE.

117
00:05:45,852 --> 00:05:46,920
LAURA. PLEASE.

118
00:05:48,088 --> 00:05:50,757
WE'RE BORN ALONE, WE DIE ALONE.

119
00:05:50,791 --> 00:05:51,858
LET'S NOT LIVE OUR LIVES ALONE.

120
00:05:51,892 --> 00:05:54,628
JACK. OUR LOVE CAN'T SAVE US NOW!

121
00:05:55,595 --> 00:05:57,064
IT'S TOO LATE.

122
00:05:57,831 --> 00:05:59,800
LOVE IS EVERYTHING, AND WE'VE GOT IT.

123
00:05:59,833 --> 00:06:01,868
WE'VE GOT IT RIGHT IN OUR HANDS.

124
00:06:01,902 --> 00:06:04,805
EMMA? MIND TAKING OUT THE GARBAGE.

125
00:06:04,838 --> 00:06:06,673
HONEY, WHAT'S WRONG?

126
00:06:06,707 --> 00:06:07,374
NOTHING.

127
00:06:10,844 --> 00:06:14,781
EM, THOSE SHOWS ARE DESIGNED TO UPSET PEOPLE.

128
00:06:17,718 --> 00:06:22,723
IT'S JUST THAT WE'RE SO SMALL AND THE UNIVERSE IS SO MASSIVE.

129
00:06:22,756 --> 00:06:24,991
WE'RE JUST LITTLE SPECKS.

130
00:06:25,025 --> 00:06:26,493
FLOATING...ALONE.

131
00:06:27,994 --> 00:06:30,564
UH-OH. SOLAR SYSTEM ANXIETY?

132
00:06:30,597 --> 00:06:32,499
I REMEMBER IT WELL.

133
00:06:32,532 --> 00:06:35,068
BIG HUGE UNIVERSE, TINY LITTLE ME,

134
00:06:35,102 --> 00:06:36,703
WHAT'S THE POINT.

135
00:06:37,604 --> 00:06:39,005
YOU CAN'T BEAT IT.

136
00:06:40,173 --> 00:06:41,775
BUT YOU CAN SHOP.

137
00:06:42,743 --> 00:06:43,810
I DID WELL THIS WEEK.

138
00:06:43,844 --> 00:06:48,582
LET'S GO SPEND MY TIPS. IT'S CALLED RETAIL THERAPY.

139
00:06:53,553 --> 00:06:56,823
I LIKE RETAIL THERAPY. AND I LOVE MY NEW SWEATER.

140
00:06:56,857 --> 00:06:57,924
IT'LL GO WITH EVERYTHING.

141
00:06:57,958 --> 00:07:02,062
MY LITTLE BLUE SKIRT, MY BLUE CHINOS, MY JEANS...

142
00:07:02,829 --> 00:07:05,832
OOOH. I'D LIKE A LICK OF THAT.

143
00:07:05,866 --> 00:07:07,567
EXCUSE ME?

144
00:07:09,936 --> 00:07:12,739
I'D LIKE A LICK OF YOUR CONE.

145
00:07:13,206 --> 00:07:13,807
SUE ME.

146
00:07:14,941 --> 00:07:15,909
I PROBABLY COULD.

147
00:07:15,942 --> 00:07:18,779
BECAUSE I DON'T THINK THAT'S WHAT YOU MEANT.

148
00:07:18,812 --> 00:07:19,513
MOM...

149
00:07:20,547 --> 00:07:23,083
GUESS WHAT. YOU DON'T TALK TO WOMEN LIKE THAT.

150
00:07:23,116 --> 00:07:24,751
ESPECIALLY - YOUNG WOMEN.

151
00:07:24,785 --> 00:07:26,853
IT'S A JOKE. I WAS JUST KIDDING.

152
00:07:26,887 --> 00:07:28,088
MY DAUGHTER AND I CAME HERE TO SHOP.

153
00:07:28,121 --> 00:07:33,160
NOT TO BE HARASSED BY SOME PIG, MASQUERADING AS A COMEDIAN.

154
00:07:33,193 --> 00:07:35,095
WHEN YOU TALK TO WOMEN LIKE THAT?

155
00:07:35,128 --> 00:07:36,029
IT'S SCARY.

156
00:07:36,062 --> 00:07:39,766
IT MAKES US FEEL BAD. DON'T DO IT AGAIN.

157
00:07:41,802 --> 00:07:45,672
MOM, CAN WE GO NOW? I'M MILDLY DYING.

158
00:07:45,705 --> 00:07:47,207
SEE? THIS IS THE PROBLEM.

159
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:49,075
YOU'RE EMBARRASSED BECAUSE OF WHAT HE SAID.

160
00:07:49,109 --> 00:07:50,811
IT'S SO WRONG!

161
00:07:50,844 --> 00:07:51,778
SERIOUSLY. EMMA.

162
00:07:51,812 --> 00:07:53,547
DON'T EVER LET SOME GUY MAKE YOU FEEL BAD.

163
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:56,750
JUST FOR BEING FEMALE. OKAY? PROMISE?

164
00:07:57,317 --> 00:07:59,586
SEE YOU TOMORROW?

165
00:08:11,331 --> 00:08:13,600
TOBY, YOU CAN'T JUST ASK JIMMY FOR DINNER

166
00:08:13,633 --> 00:08:15,702
EVERY SINGLE NIGHT. OKAY?

167
00:08:16,036 --> 00:08:17,838
HE'S YOUR BOYFRIEND.

168
00:08:17,871 --> 00:08:21,174
YEAH, AND HE'S DRIVING ME CRAZY!

169
00:08:22,209 --> 00:08:23,810
HE'S TOTALLY SWEET.

170
00:08:23,844 --> 00:08:25,712
HE'S TOTALLY HERE. ALL THE TIME.

171
00:08:25,745 --> 00:08:27,280
IT'S SUFFOCATING.

172
00:08:27,314 --> 00:08:28,515
YOU KNOW WHAT?

173
00:08:28,548 --> 00:08:32,819
AT THIS POINT? I'M JUST ABOUT READY TO BREAK UP WITH HIM.

174
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:48,835
SEE? IT GOES WITH EVERYTHING!

175
00:08:48,869 --> 00:08:50,871
WOW. SEXY SHIRT.

176
00:08:50,904 --> 00:08:52,672
EM, DON'T GET MAD...

177
00:08:52,706 --> 00:08:56,877
PLEASE. IT'S NOT LIKE J.T.'S EXACTLY MR. FASHION FORWARD.

178
00:08:56,910 --> 00:08:58,812
MR. FASHION WHO?

179
00:08:58,845 --> 00:09:01,815
J.T., I'LL SEE YOU IN HOMEROOM.

180
00:09:07,821 --> 00:09:10,991
HAPPY BIRTHDAY JIMMY!

181
00:09:17,764 --> 00:09:19,032
HEY, TOBES.

182
00:09:19,065 --> 00:09:21,101
DID YOU MASTER THAT MOVE I TAUGHT YOU?

183
00:09:21,134 --> 00:09:22,802
UH - ALMOST.

184
00:09:23,370 --> 00:09:24,671
HAPPY BIRTHDAY.

185
00:09:24,704 --> 00:09:26,907
THANKS. WE CAN WORK ON IT LATER.

186
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:29,342
UH - RIGHT. LATER.

187
00:09:31,678 --> 00:09:34,714
YOU KNOW, I'VE BEEN THINKING - ABOUT WHAT YOU SAID LAST NIGHT.

188
00:09:34,748 --> 00:09:36,716
YOU KNOW - ABOUT WHEN YOU'RE TRYING TO MASTER

189
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:38,818
A REALLY COMPLICATED MOVE,

190
00:09:38,852 --> 00:09:40,220
LEAVE IT ALONE FOR A WHILE,

191
00:09:40,253 --> 00:09:42,088
COME BACK TO IT LATER?

192
00:09:43,390 --> 00:09:43,990
YEAH...

193
00:09:45,025 --> 00:09:49,062
YOU KNOW - GIVE IT A REST. DON'T SUFFOCATE IT.

194
00:09:50,130 --> 00:09:52,132
KINDA LIKE - WITH GIRLS.

195
00:09:52,866 --> 00:09:54,901
TOBES. WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

196
00:09:54,935 --> 00:09:58,305
NOTHING. NOTHING. IT'S JUST - INTERESTINGLY - SIMILAR.

197
00:09:58,338 --> 00:10:00,340
THAT'S ALL. NO BIGGIE...

198
00:10:03,410 --> 00:10:05,145
WHAT DID ASHLEY SAY?

199
00:10:05,912 --> 00:10:08,081
COME ON. YOU'RE MY FRIEND!

200
00:10:10,083 --> 00:10:12,919
WHAT? IS SHE'S FEELING SUFFOCATED?

201
00:10:14,287 --> 00:10:16,890
LIKE WE'RE TOGETHER TOO MUCH?

202
00:10:19,292 --> 00:10:22,662
SHE DOESN'T WANT TO BREAK UP DOES SHE?

203
00:10:43,149 --> 00:10:45,051
YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE SAID ANYTHING.

204
00:10:45,085 --> 00:10:47,954
J.T. - JIMMY'S LIKE TOBY'S OLDER BROTHER.

205
00:10:47,988 --> 00:10:49,723
HE HAD TO TELL HIM.

206
00:10:49,756 --> 00:10:52,392
YEAH, BUT ASHLEY IS HIS OLDER SISTER.

207
00:10:52,425 --> 00:10:53,026
SORTA.

208
00:10:53,893 --> 00:10:56,129
MAYBE SHE WAS JUST HAVING A BAD DAY.

209
00:10:56,162 --> 00:10:58,865
MORE LIKE A BAD DECADE.

210
00:11:02,435 --> 00:11:06,373
AND BEFORE THIS DECADE GETS ANY WORSE, C'MON...

211
00:11:09,075 --> 00:11:10,143
HEY EMMA.

212
00:11:10,176 --> 00:11:11,845
SEAN. WHAT'S UP?

213
00:11:11,878 --> 00:11:12,746
NOTHING.

214
00:11:13,947 --> 00:11:15,415
LISTEN, I CAME TO APOLOGIZE

215
00:11:15,448 --> 00:11:17,817
ABOUT THAT WHOLE ASTROLOGY THING.

216
00:11:17,851 --> 00:11:18,918
NO, IT'S MY FAULT.

217
00:11:18,952 --> 00:11:20,987
I SHOULDN'T HAVE ACTED LIKE THAT.

218
00:11:21,021 --> 00:11:22,889
MAYBE YOU COULD DO MY HOROSCOPE ON THE COMPUTER?

219
00:11:22,922 --> 00:11:26,026
IT COULD BE KINDA FUN, AND WE HAVE TIME BEFORE CLASS...

220
00:11:26,059 --> 00:11:27,894
YEAH, THAT'D BE GREAT.

221
00:11:32,899 --> 00:11:34,868
DID YOU SIT IN SOMETHING?

222
00:11:34,901 --> 00:11:35,835
WHAT? NO-

223
00:11:39,539 --> 00:11:40,473
YOU COMING?

224
00:11:41,441 --> 00:11:42,842
WHAT DO I DO?!

225
00:11:42,876 --> 00:11:43,643
I DON'T KNOW.

226
00:11:43,677 --> 00:11:46,446
THIS - HASN'T HAPPENED TO ME YET.

227
00:11:46,479 --> 00:11:47,213
UH...NO.

228
00:11:48,248 --> 00:11:49,749
I DON'T THINK WE HAVE TIME FOR THE HOROSCOPES.

229
00:11:49,783 --> 00:11:52,919
SO - YOU SHOULD GO. TO CLASS. NOW.

230
00:12:01,861 --> 00:12:04,030
OKAY, DON'T PANIC.

231
00:12:05,532 --> 00:12:07,000
EVERYTHING'S GOING TO BE FINE.

232
00:12:07,033 --> 00:12:09,302
WE'LL FIGURE OUT SOMETHING.

233
00:12:12,572 --> 00:12:14,107
I CAN'T BREAK UP WITH HIM TONIGHT.

234
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:15,008
WHY NOT?

235
00:12:15,041 --> 00:12:16,743
IT'S HIS BIRTHDAY?

236
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:23,149
JIMMY, HEY. WE WERE JUST -

237
00:12:23,850 --> 00:12:26,886
YEAH. YOU DON'T HAVE TO COME TONIGHT.

238
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:28,388
WHAT? JIMMY, IT'S YOUR BIRTHDAY.

239
00:12:28,421 --> 00:12:30,290
OF COURSE I'M COMING.

240
00:12:30,323 --> 00:12:31,858
I'M JUST SAYING.

241
00:12:46,573 --> 00:12:47,841
WE SHOULD CELEBRATE.

242
00:12:47,874 --> 00:12:49,876
CELEBRATE WHAT EXACTLY?

243
00:12:49,909 --> 00:12:51,244
BECOMING A WOMAN.

244
00:12:51,277 --> 00:12:52,846
EM! YOU CAN GET PREGNANT NOW!

245
00:12:52,879 --> 00:12:53,813
OH. GREAT.

246
00:12:53,847 --> 00:12:57,383
CAN WE CELEBRATE BY FINDING ME A WASHROOM?

247
00:12:59,986 --> 00:13:01,821
YESTERDAY? I THOUGHT YOU WERE A WORKAHOLIC.

248
00:13:01,855 --> 00:13:03,823
BUT IT WAS JUST PMS!

249
00:13:03,857 --> 00:13:06,192
MANNY, I CAN'T GO TO CLASS LIKE THIS.

250
00:13:06,226 --> 00:13:08,528
EM, WE HAVE A BOOK REPORT TO DO.

251
00:13:08,561 --> 00:13:10,864
DO YOU HAVE A JACKET? YOU COULD TIE IT AROUND YOUR WAIST.

252
00:13:10,897 --> 00:13:13,833
I DON'T HAVE A JACKET. IT'S LIKE SUMMER OUTSIDE.

253
00:13:13,867 --> 00:13:15,068
I KNOW! YOUR GYM SHORTS!

254
00:13:15,101 --> 00:13:16,569
I BROUGHT THEM HOME TO WASH.

255
00:13:16,603 --> 00:13:17,871
ME TOO.

256
00:13:18,972 --> 00:13:19,939
I'LL FIGURE OUT SOMETHING.

257
00:13:19,973 --> 00:13:21,908
MANNY, DON'T LEAVE ME -

258
00:13:23,910 --> 00:13:25,111
HEY TOBES. WAIT UP.

259
00:13:25,145 --> 00:13:27,347
CAN YOU REMIND MOM THAT I'M AT JIMMY'S FOR DINNER TONIGHT?

260
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:28,281
WHY ARE YOU EVEN GOING?

261
00:13:28,314 --> 00:13:29,949
I MEAN, IF YOU'RE JUST GOING TO DUMP HIM.

262
00:13:29,983 --> 00:13:30,884
REALLY NICE, TOBY.

263
00:13:30,917 --> 00:13:31,684
LISTENING IN ON MY PRIVATE CONVERSATION?!

264
00:13:31,718 --> 00:13:33,453
YOU WERE THREE FEET AWAY!

265
00:13:33,486 --> 00:13:34,888
ASH. JIMMY'S AMAZING.

266
00:13:34,921 --> 00:13:36,222
HE'S NICE TO YOU, HE'S NICE TO ME -

267
00:13:36,256 --> 00:13:38,892
HE'S ALWAYS AROUND! HE'S ALWAYS THERE, IN MY FACE.

268
00:13:38,925 --> 00:13:40,126
YOU'RE BEING JUST LIKE OUR PARENTS!

269
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:41,628
ONE HINT OF TROUBLE, AND THEY WALK.

270
00:13:41,661 --> 00:13:45,298
TOBY. MY DAD'S GAY. IT'S NOT EXACTLY ONE HINT OF TROUBLE.

271
00:13:45,331 --> 00:13:47,834
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND ANYTHING!

272
00:13:49,002 --> 00:13:50,170
YOU DON'T BRING PEOPLE INTO YOUR LIFE,

273
00:13:50,203 --> 00:13:52,205
JUST TO THROW THEM AWAY.

274
00:14:02,649 --> 00:14:04,918
MANNY, WHAT TOOK YOU SO -

275
00:14:04,951 --> 00:14:07,320
WOW. LITTLE MISS SAVE-THE-WORLD IS SKIPPING A CLASS.

276
00:14:07,353 --> 00:14:10,957
YOU'RE NOT PROTESTING SOMETHING, ARE YOU?

277
00:14:12,192 --> 00:14:14,928
UH-OH. YOUR FRIEND CAME TO VISIT.

278
00:14:14,961 --> 00:14:16,362
HON. YOU DON'T WEAR LIGHT COLOURS

279
00:14:16,396 --> 00:14:17,931
WHEN YOU'RE GETTING YOUR PERIOD.

280
00:14:17,964 --> 00:14:19,065
I DIDN'T KNOW.

281
00:14:19,098 --> 00:14:23,002
IT'S MY FIRST TIME! OKAY. SO, JUST - LEAVE ME ALONE!

282
00:14:25,238 --> 00:14:27,907
I'VE GOT A PAD. IF YOU NEED IT.

283
00:14:27,941 --> 00:14:29,976
I MEAN, YOU COULD GET ONE FROM THE OFFICE,

284
00:14:30,009 --> 00:14:31,678
BUT THAT'S KIND OF A DRAG.

285
00:14:31,711 --> 00:14:33,112
EW. IMAGINE?

286
00:14:33,146 --> 00:14:36,015
"MR. RADITCH, CAN I HAVE A MAXI-PAD?"

287
00:14:36,049 --> 00:14:38,651
MINI. BUT YEAH - TOTALLY GROSS.

288
00:14:43,957 --> 00:14:46,259
IT'S GOT WINGS...

289
00:14:46,292 --> 00:14:48,962
MAN. I AM SO NOT READY FOR THIS.

290
00:14:48,995 --> 00:14:50,630
HEY, YOU'LL GET BOOBS NOW.

291
00:14:50,663 --> 00:14:52,699
OH, LIKE I WANT BOOBS?

292
00:14:52,732 --> 00:14:54,400
YOU MIGHT AT SOME POINT.

293
00:14:54,434 --> 00:14:56,936
THEY'RE ACTUALLY REALLY GREAT.

294
00:14:57,503 --> 00:15:00,240
BUT - I MEAN, I LIKE BEING A KID.

295
00:15:00,707 --> 00:15:04,344
YOU'RE STILL A KID. JUST WITH A MINI-PAD.

296
00:15:04,377 --> 00:15:05,111
BIG DEAL.

297
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:07,714
SO, I'M NOT GOING TO TURN INTO-

298
00:15:07,747 --> 00:15:08,081
ME?

299
00:15:09,148 --> 00:15:10,483
HONEY. YOU WISH.

300
00:15:11,751 --> 00:15:12,252
EMMA?

301
00:15:14,554 --> 00:15:17,924
WHAT? IT'S THE GIRLS WASHROOM. SUE ME.

302
00:15:25,131 --> 00:15:26,466
AND SO IN THE END EVERYONE DIED,

303
00:15:26,499 --> 00:15:28,701
AND EVERYONE WAS REALLY SAD.

304
00:15:28,735 --> 00:15:30,970
REALLY, REALLY SAD.

305
00:15:31,004 --> 00:15:33,473
AND THAT'S OUR BOOK REPORT ON PONTY POOLE CHANGES EVERYTHING.

306
00:15:33,506 --> 00:15:34,340
THANK YOU.

307
00:15:36,409 --> 00:15:38,177
IT WOULD'VE BEEN NICE TO HEAR YOUR INTERPRETATION

308
00:15:38,211 --> 00:15:42,081
ON THE BOOK, BOYS, INSTEAD OF A PLOT SYNOPSIS,

309
00:15:42,115 --> 00:15:42,615
BUT...

310
00:15:45,585 --> 00:15:46,719
SORRY MS. KWAN. WE HAD A BIT OF A -

311
00:15:46,753 --> 00:15:48,321
EMERGENCY.

312
00:15:48,354 --> 00:15:50,757
REALLY? WELL, YOU CAN GIVE ME DETAILS AFTER CLASS. BUT NOW -

313
00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:52,659
BOOK REPORT, PLEASE.

314
00:16:05,505 --> 00:16:08,775
OKAY. OUR BOOK WAS: "I HEARD THE OWL CALL MY - "

315
00:16:08,808 --> 00:16:10,310
GYM SHORTS?

316
00:16:11,411 --> 00:16:14,747
YO, YO - PUFF EMMA'S IN DA HOUSE!

317
00:16:15,648 --> 00:16:17,283
THIS BOOK'S A BIT -

318
00:16:17,317 --> 00:16:18,651
TOO BIG FOR YOU?

319
00:16:19,619 --> 00:16:21,287
METAPHORICAL.

320
00:16:21,321 --> 00:16:23,990
GUYS! PULL YOURSELVES TOGETHER!

321
00:16:25,258 --> 00:16:26,592
DO YOU HAVE A PROBLEM?

322
00:16:26,626 --> 00:16:29,996
EMMA, IT'S OKAY, WE CAN JUST -

323
00:16:30,763 --> 00:16:32,598
AW. DID EMMIE PEE HER PANTS?

324
00:16:32,632 --> 00:16:36,669
NO. I JUST GOT MY PERIOD. FOR THE FIRST TIME.

325
00:16:37,603 --> 00:16:39,539
MENSTRUATION? YOU MAY HAVE HEARD OF IT.

326
00:16:39,572 --> 00:16:42,608
HAPPENS TO, OH, FIFTY PERCENT OF THE POPULATION?

327
00:16:42,642 --> 00:16:45,078
PERFECTLY NATURAL. NOTHING TO BE ASHAMED OF.

328
00:16:45,111 --> 00:16:46,579
RIGHT, MS. KWAN?

329
00:16:46,612 --> 00:16:48,715
ABSOLUTELY RIGHT, EMMA.

330
00:16:48,748 --> 00:16:50,683
NOW. MAY WE CONTINUE?

331
00:16:51,751 --> 00:16:55,388
OUR BOOK WAS: I HEARD THE OWL CALL MY NAME.

332
00:16:55,421 --> 00:16:57,190
IT'S A BIT METAPHORICAL.

333
00:16:57,223 --> 00:16:59,025
BECAUSE IT RELATES-

334
00:17:00,426 --> 00:17:04,097
IT RELATES THE LIFE OF A YOUNG PRIEST-

335
00:17:04,731 --> 00:17:07,767
WHO DIDN'T LIKE OWLS VERY MUCH.

336
00:17:21,581 --> 00:17:22,582
WELL - WHAT DID YOU ASK FOR?

337
00:17:22,615 --> 00:17:24,684
I TOLD MY DAD I WANTED A SNOWBOARD.

338
00:17:24,717 --> 00:17:27,453
HE PROBABLY DIDN'T EVEN HEAR ME.

339
00:17:30,790 --> 00:17:32,525
MOM? DAD, I'M HOME...

340
00:17:39,599 --> 00:17:42,535
THEY'RE NOT LIKE YOUR FAMILY. OKAY?

341
00:17:44,170 --> 00:17:47,273
TEN BUCKS, SHE'S PICKING UP CHINESE.

342
00:17:47,306 --> 00:17:49,509
SHE LEFT ME A MESSAGE.

343
00:17:49,542 --> 00:17:52,478
IT'S COOL. I LOVE CHINESE.

344
00:17:55,815 --> 00:17:57,617
IS EVERYTHING OKAY?

345
00:18:01,554 --> 00:18:02,388
MOM JUST CALLED TO TELL ME

346
00:18:02,422 --> 00:18:04,590
THAT HER AND DAD ARE WORKING LATE AGAIN.

347
00:18:04,624 --> 00:18:07,360
SHE SAID I SHOULD ORDER MYSELF A PIZZA.

348
00:18:07,393 --> 00:18:09,495
WELL, WHY DON'T WE HAVE YOUR BIRTHDAY AT MY HOUSE THEN.

349
00:18:09,529 --> 00:18:11,464
MY MOM'S MAKING WINGS -

350
00:18:12,665 --> 00:18:13,699
ASH - FORGET IT.

351
00:18:13,733 --> 00:18:17,703
LOOK. CAN WE JUST BREAK UP AND GET THIS OVER WITH?

352
00:18:17,737 --> 00:18:18,337
- WHAT?

353
00:18:22,775 --> 00:18:25,912
YOU FEEL SUFFOCATED, RIGHT? TOBY TOLD ME.

354
00:18:25,945 --> 00:18:29,348
DON'T LISTEN TO TOBY. HE DOESN'T KNOW ANYTHING.

355
00:18:29,382 --> 00:18:33,119
SO HE WAS WRONG? YOU DON'T WANT TO BREAK UP?

356
00:18:34,687 --> 00:18:37,890
CAN WE JUST FORGET THIS. IT'S YOUR BIRTHDAY.

357
00:18:37,924 --> 00:18:39,158
OH I GET IT.

358
00:18:39,192 --> 00:18:41,627
YOU DON'T WANT TO BREAK UP WITH ME BECAUSE IT'S MY BIRTHDAY.

359
00:18:41,661 --> 00:18:43,429
WHAT IS THAT, LIKE MY BIRTHDAY PRESENT?

360
00:18:43,463 --> 00:18:44,564
JIMMY --

361
00:18:44,597 --> 00:18:47,166
YOU WANNA BREAK UP, ASH? THEN LET'S BREAK UP. NOW.

362
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:50,803
OKAY? IT'S OVER. SO - GO. GET OUTTA HERE.

363
00:18:52,672 --> 00:18:54,607
WHAT'RE YOU, DEAF? GO!

364
00:19:09,722 --> 00:19:11,657
HI ANTONIO, IT'S JIMMY.

365
00:19:13,693 --> 00:19:14,827
YEAH, THE USUAL.

366
00:19:15,528 --> 00:19:16,729
MEDIUM PEPPERONI.

367
00:19:17,864 --> 00:19:18,664
THANKS.

368
00:19:24,804 --> 00:19:26,672
SO. YOU'RE FEELING - OKAY?

369
00:19:26,706 --> 00:19:30,910
OH YEAH, MANNY. I LOVE BEING A WOMAN.

370
00:19:30,943 --> 00:19:32,345
I DON'T FEEL ANY DIFFERENT.

371
00:19:32,378 --> 00:19:33,713
HERE YOU GO.

372
00:19:33,746 --> 00:19:35,481
BUT I DID HAVE THIS IDEA...

373
00:19:35,515 --> 00:19:39,385
LIKE MY MOM SAYS: NEVER BE EMBARRASSED TO BE FEMALE.

374
00:19:39,418 --> 00:19:40,686
PAIGE. WOULD YOU SIGN MY PETITION

375
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,388
TO GET A TAMPON DISPENSER INSTALLED

376
00:19:42,421 --> 00:19:43,623
IN THE GIRLS' WASHROOM?

377
00:19:43,656 --> 00:19:44,590
YEAH. SURE.

378
00:19:56,369 --> 00:19:59,705
HEY, SEAN. WANNA SIGN EMMA'S PETITION?

379
00:20:00,339 --> 00:20:01,407
FOR TAMPONS?

380
00:20:03,543 --> 00:20:03,943
SURE.

381
00:20:06,546 --> 00:20:10,816
IF EMMA CAME UP WITH IT, IT'S GOTTA BE A GOOD IDEA.

382
00:20:52,625 --> 00:20:53,693
HEY, JIMMY...

383
00:20:54,093 --> 00:20:54,994
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

384
00:20:55,027 --> 00:20:57,430
I JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE YOU'RE ALRIGHT.

385
00:20:57,463 --> 00:20:59,932
I'M FINE. THANKS FOR ASKING.

386
00:20:59,966 --> 00:21:02,435
JIMMY, PLEASE. CAN WE TALK?

387
00:21:03,436 --> 00:21:05,504
I THINK WE TALKED ENOUGH LAST NIGHT.

388
00:21:05,538 --> 00:21:08,941
I JUST THINK THAT - MAYBE I OVER-REACTED.

389
00:21:09,609 --> 00:21:11,043
AND MAYBE I DIDN'T MEAN TO CALL YOU --

390
00:21:11,077 --> 00:21:14,280
SUFFOCATING? CLINGY? A SUCTION CUP?

391
00:21:14,847 --> 00:21:16,015
JIMMY. PLEASE.

392
00:21:23,122 --> 00:21:26,092
YOU'RE NOT DOING THIS 'CAUSE YOU FEEL SORRY FOR ME, ARE YOU?

393
00:21:26,125 --> 00:21:27,493
OF COURSE NOT.

394
00:21:32,465 --> 00:21:33,866
I LOVE YOU, ASH.
