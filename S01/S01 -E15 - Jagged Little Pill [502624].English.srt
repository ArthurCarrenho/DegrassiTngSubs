OH, HERE IS MRS. WREN'S NUMBER, IN CASE YOU NEED ANYTHING.

STOP WORRYING. TOBY AND I ARE GONNA BE FINE.

00:00:31,472 --> 00:00:33,474
YOU'RE JUST GOING OVERNIGHT.

10
00:00:33,507 --> 00:00:35,309
I KNOW. I'M BEING A MOTHER.

11
00:00:35,342 --> 00:00:38,479
OKAY, SO- UM, TONIGHT YOU'RE GOING--

I KNOW. ONE FRIEND OVER EACH, AND NO PARTIES. I HEARD.

00:00:43,584 --> 00:00:48,122

I'LL NEVER FORGET YOU EITHER, MS. KWAN.

00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:52,419
HAVE A GOOD BREAK, MR. MASON.

I'M GONNA MISS YOU!

41
00:02:35,729 --> 00:02:38,499
THE "STUDENT OF ALL STUDENTS"? THAT IS SO LAME.

42
00:02:38,532 --> 00:02:40,367
I THINK IT'S SWEET.

43
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:43,237
THIS NEXT AWARD IS FOR DAVE

44
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:45,439
BECAUSE HE PUTS THE CAPITAL "G" IN "GOOD STUDENT."

45
00:02:47,908 --> 00:02:50,744

WHAT'S JIMMY GONNA SAY WHEN HE FINDS OUT?

54
00:03:06,693 --> 00:03:08,562
FINDS OUT WHAT?

55
00:03:08,595 --> 00:03:11,365
THAT I CAN ONLY HAVE ONE FRIEND OVER TONIGHT.

56
00:03:11,398 --> 00:03:13,367
AND SHE INVITED TERRI. NOT YOU. OR ME.

57
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,801
OH. OKAY.

58
00:03:15,669 --> 00:03:17,838
I THOUGHT YOU'D BE UPSET.

59
00:03:17,871 --> 00:03:22,876
RULES ARE RULES, RIGHT? WE'LL DO SOMETHING TOMORROW.

60
00:03:24,311 --> 00:03:26,380
OKAY, AM I MISSING SOMETHING HERE?

61
00:03:26,413 --> 00:03:27,548
OH, JUST THE CHANCE TO HANG OUT WITH ME

62
00:03:27,581 --> 00:03:29,516

PAIGE. IF YOU REALLY WANT TO COME OVER?

64
00:03:31,351 --> 00:03:32,819
COME OVER. WHATEVER.

65
00:03:37,457 --> 00:03:40,427
SO, GIRLS, WHAT ARE YOUR PLANS FOR THIS VERY MOMENTOUS EVE?

66
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:43,530
GIRLS' NIGHT AT MY PLACE. MEANING - NO BOYS ALLOWED.

67
00:03:43,564 --> 00:03:45,632
ESPECIALLY BOYS NAMED SEAN.

68
00:03:50,070 --> 00:03:52,706
MAYBE SHE'S LEARNED THAT BAD BOYS ONLY LEAD TO HEARTACHE.

69
00:03:52,739 --> 00:03:56,310
AND NOW SHE'S LOOKING FOR A GOOD BOY? ONE NAMED TOBY?

70
00:03:56,343 --> 00:03:59,813
NOT LIKELY. WHAT YOU NEED IS A NEW APPROACH.

71
00:04:01,548 --> 00:04:02,883
SEAN'S APPROACH.

72
00:04:04,785 --> 00:04:05,619
HEY, SEAN.

73
00:04:07,354 --> 00:04:09,890
TOBY HERE'S HAVING THE BOYS OVER TONIGHT -

74
00:04:09,923 --> 00:04:12,459
TO PLAY SOME CARDS, TALK GIRLS, GUY STUFF.

75
00:04:12,492 --> 00:04:13,427
WANNA COME?

76
00:04:15,062 --> 00:04:15,529
NO.

77
00:04:17,464 --> 00:04:20,400
YOU KNOW, EMMA'S GOING TO BE THERE -

78
00:04:20,434 --> 00:04:21,435
EMMA?

79
00:04:23,503 --> 00:04:25,872
UM, YEAH. WE'RE -

81
00:04:33,714 --> 00:04:34,314
OKAY.

82
00:04:39,486 --> 00:04:40,921
ARE YOU INSANE?!

83
00:04:40,954 --> 00:04:42,723
AFTER TONIGHT'S LITTLE TUTORING SESSION,

84
00:04:42,756 --> 00:04:45,492
EMMA WILL BE ALL YOURS. TRUST ME.

85
00:04:48,095 --> 00:04:50,430
DO YOU THINK JIMMY'S REACTION WAS WEIRD? ABOUT TONIGHT?

86
00:04:50,464 --> 00:04:53,066
NO. I THINK HE WAS JUST TRYING TO BE A GOOD BOYFRIEND.

87
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:55,569
A GOOD BOYFRIEND WOULD WANT TO COME OVER. NO MATTER WHAT.

88
00:04:55,602 --> 00:04:59,106
MY PARENTS ARE AWAY. HE SHOULD- NEVER MIND.

89
00:04:59,139 --> 00:05:02,909
ANYWAY, I THOUGHT YOU WERE, YOU KNOW, COOLING ON HIM.

90
00:05:02,943 --> 00:05:05,479
EXACTLY THE OPPOSITE.

91
00:05:05,512 --> 00:05:07,547
AFTER YOU'VE BEEN GOING OUT FOR AWHILE THINGS GET DEEPER.

92
00:05:07,581 --> 00:05:08,315
OH.

93
00:05:09,082 --> 00:05:11,418
UNLESS HE'S COOLING ON ME.

94
00:05:11,451 --> 00:05:14,521
I DON'T THINK THAT'S HOW IT IS.

95
00:05:17,391 --> 00:05:18,392
A-HEM.

96
00:05:21,395 --> 00:05:23,930
OKAY. BEFORE YOU GO ALL PARENTAL ON ME, I FORGOT-

97
00:05:23,964 --> 00:05:25,565
HAZEL AND I HAD PLANS TONIGHT,

98
00:05:25,599 --> 00:05:27,401
I DIDN'T THINK IT WOULD BE A PROBLEM.

99
00:05:27,434 --> 00:05:29,369
NO, IT'S FINE.

102
00:05:42,015 --> 00:05:44,985
OKAY, I KNOW MOM AND JEFF SAID ONLY ONE FRIEND EACH, BUT -

103
00:05:45,018 --> 00:05:46,987
-BUT NOTHING, ASHLEY. IT'S OUR PLEASURE TO SHARE

104
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:51,024

106
00:06:11,678 --> 00:06:14,047

107
00:06:14,081 --> 00:06:16,450

108
00:06:16,483 --> 00:06:20,053

SEAN? WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

112
00:06:34,735 --> 00:06:36,069
TOBY INVITED ME.

OKAY, TOBY'S HANGING OUT WITH SEAN? THAT'S WEIRD.

116
00:06:47,814 --> 00:06:50,183
HAS SEAN BECOME A TOTAL BABE SINCE THAT LITTLE FIGHT,

117
00:06:50,217 --> 00:06:51,084
OR WHAT?

118
00:06:58,825 --> 00:07:03,430
SO. SEAN. GIRLS. CARE TO SHARE YOUR EXPERTISE?

119
00:07:04,064 --> 00:07:05,465
WHA- WHAT?

120
00:07:06,133 --> 00:07:08,502
YOU KNOW. ON HOW YOU SCORE LIKE SUNDIN.

121
00:07:08,535 --> 00:07:09,202
I DON'T.

122
00:07:10,737 --> 00:07:14,608
COME ON. GIRLS, LIKE, DROOL OVER YOU.

123
00:07:15,041 --> 00:07:18,879
I DON'T KNOW. I JUST ACT LIKE MYSELF, I GUESS.

124
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,815
WHY? WHO DO YOU LIKE?

125
00:07:23,950 --> 00:07:26,686
SO GUYS, ARE WE GONNA PLAY OR WHAT?

126
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,989
EMMA KNOWS I'M HERE, RIGHT?

127
00:07:30,090 --> 00:07:30,223
YEP.

128
00:07:31,591 --> 00:07:33,693
AND SHE'S FINE WITH THIS?

129
00:07:33,727 --> 00:07:37,230
OF COURSE. EVEN MORE FINE, IS THIS.

130
00:07:40,567 --> 00:07:43,970
I BROUGHT US A LITTLE PARTY FAVOUR, BOYS.

131

E? J.T. WHAT ARE YOU -!

134
00:07:55,148 --> 00:07:57,517
ECSTASY'S THE LOVE DRUG, RIGHT?

135
00:07:57,551 --> 00:08:01,588
THERE'S A WHOLE ROOM OF GIRLS DOWN THERE NEEDING SOME LOVE.

136
00:08:01,621 --> 00:08:03,590
I DON'T KNOW, MAN. THIS STUFF'S PRETTY INTENSE.

137
00:08:03,623 --> 00:08:08,728
BETTER BE. I PAID MY COUSIN TWO WEEKS ALLOWANCE FOR IT.

138
00:08:08,762 --> 00:08:10,030
LET'S SPLIT IT.

139
00:08:11,264 --> 00:08:13,600
OKAY, GIMME THE PILL.

WHAT?

142
00:08:23,877 --> 00:08:25,612

HEY SEAN. HAVING FUN UPSTAIRS?

IS THAT -? SEAN YOU BROUGHT DRUGS?!

146
00:08:39,593 --> 00:08:41,228
NOT ME. J.T.

147
00:08:41,261 --> 00:08:42,996
J.T.?! TOBY?

148
00:08:44,097 --> 00:08:48,301
THEY'RE WAY TOO YOUNG TO BE EXPERIMENTING WITH DRUGS.

149
00:08:51,638 --> 00:08:53,940
A VITAMIN PILL. WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

150
00:09:01,314 --> 00:09:06,720
FLUSH IT DOWN THE SINK. THEY'LL NEVER KNOW THE DIFFERENCE.

151
00:09:16,396 --> 00:09:17,964
TOBY, COME ON.

152
00:09:17,998 --> 00:09:21,234
YOU WANT TO BE A BAD BOY, START ACTING LIKE ONE.

153
00:09:21,268 --> 00:09:21,935
BAD BOY?

154
00:09:22,903 --> 00:09:25,305
IGNORE HIM. LET'S JUST DO IT.

155
00:09:27,374 --> 00:09:29,743
SURE YOU DON'T WANNA JOIN US?

156
00:09:29,776 --> 00:09:31,278
YEAH. MY SOCIAL WORKER'D KILL ME.

157
00:09:31,311 --> 00:09:32,245
OKAY

158
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:38,318
HEY WAIT. CHEW IT SLOWLY. IT GIVES YOU A BETTER HIGH.

159
00:10:02,242 --> 00:10:06,212
UH, TERRI'S SLIPPING IN VIDEO NUMERO TWO.

00:10:15,889 --> 00:10:18,224
JUST STOP BEING BORING AND BREAK A RULE FOR ONCE.

165
00:10:18,258 --> 00:10:19,626
I ALREADY DID.

166
00:10:20,026 --> 00:10:21,261
THEN INVITE HIM AGAIN.

167
00:10:21,294 --> 00:10:24,130
HON, YOU JUST NEED TO LIVE A LITTLE.

168
00:10:24,164 --> 00:10:28,001
'CAUSE YOU'RE PRETTY COOL WHEN YOU DO. HONEST.

169
00:10:41,748 --> 00:10:43,917
JIMMY? COME OVER.

170
00:10:44,918 --> 00:10:47,320
I WANNA HAVE FUN -- TOGETHER.

171
00:11:07,107 --> 00:11:12,112
TOBY, I'M FLOATING, ON A FLUFFY, WHITE CLOUD.

172
00:11:14,981 --> 00:11:16,049
RIGHT...

173
00:11:17,017 --> 00:11:19,486
CAN'T YOU FEEL IT? HOW CAN YOU NOT FEEL IT?

174
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:22,722

DUDE. THIS IS INCREDIBLE.

177
00:11:37,370 --> 00:11:39,873
DUDE - THIS IS ECSTASY.

178
00:11:43,009 --> 00:11:46,513
I'M FEELIN' THE LOVE. IT'S TIME TO CALL.

179
00:11:46,546 --> 00:11:47,747
EMMA?

180
00:11:56,189 --> 00:11:59,726
GIRLS? SAY HELLO TO YOUR DESTINY.

181
00:12:05,398 --> 00:12:07,467
OW! ASH, MY HAND!

182
00:12:08,201 --> 00:12:09,469
SORRY.

183
00:12:12,338 --> 00:12:12,839
AAHHH!

184
00:12:15,275 --> 00:12:17,410
OKAY, I'M NOW OFFICIALLY DEAF.

185
00:12:17,444 --> 00:12:20,046
OH, THAT WAS SO SCARY!

186
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:24,484
I BET THEY HEARD ME SCREAM ALL THE WAY IN CHINA!

187
00:12:28,021 --> 00:12:28,354
AHH!

188
00:12:30,890 --> 00:12:33,126

189
00:12:33,159 --> 00:12:34,994
A REAL PARTY. BUT IF MY DAD FINDS OUT I'M HERE?

190
00:12:35,028 --> 00:12:38,431
I'M GONNA BE GROUNDED UNTIL MY WEDDING DAY.

191
00:12:40,166 --> 00:12:44,037
HEY - YOU'RE NOT JIMMY AND SPINNER!

192
00:12:44,070 --> 00:12:46,473
UNLESS THEY HAD A SEX CHANGE.

193
00:12:49,075 --> 00:12:53,113
LIBERTY?! I DIDN'T INVITE YOU. HOW DID YOU KNOW?

194
00:12:53,146 --> 00:12:56,349
WAS I SENDING OUT PSYCHIC VIBRATIONS?

195
00:12:56,382 --> 00:12:59,385
UH, NO. J.T. AND TOBY CALLED.

196
00:13:01,187 --> 00:13:04,257
YEAH, AND I'M THE ONE INVITING TOO MANY PEOPLE.

197
00:13:04,290 --> 00:13:09,062
LIBERTY, I'VE WANTED TO TELL YOU THIS FOR, LIKE, FOREVER?

198
00:13:09,095 --> 00:13:13,166
BUT I GET YOU. YOU'RE LIKE ME, ONLY... SORTA NOT.

199
00:13:14,334 --> 00:13:15,068

200
00:13:16,069 --> 00:13:17,237

00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:36,022
GET DOWN, LIB-ER-TAY!

204
00:13:40,527 --> 00:13:46,232
ASH WANTED TO HAVE FUN TONIGHT - I GUESS SHE'S HAVING FUN.

205
00:14:01,214 --> 00:14:02,282
HELLO?

206
00:14:05,385 --> 00:14:06,252
TOBY...?

207
00:14:07,654 --> 00:14:13,126

208
00:14:13,159 --> 00:14:13,493

00:14:16,963 --> 00:14:19,966
THANKS, UH, FOR INVITING US.

210
00:14:25,271 --> 00:14:26,439
SHALOM.

211
00:14:34,013 --> 00:14:34,948
HEY, WHAT'S GOING ON?

212
00:14:34,981 --> 00:14:36,049
HEY!

213
00:14:37,450 --> 00:14:39,953
IT'S MY KINDA PARTY.

214
00:14:40,453 --> 00:14:41,421
JIMMY! YOU'RE HERE! FINALLY!

215
00:14:41,454 --> 00:14:43,489
WHEN DID YOU DECIDE TO HAVE A PARTY?

216
00:14:43,523 --> 00:14:44,924
I THOUGHT YOUR PARENTS--

217
00:14:44,958 --> 00:14:46,926
--ISN'T THIS MUSIC JUST INCREDIBLE?

218
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:48,361
ASH, YOU'RE BURNING UP!

219
00:14:48,394 --> 00:14:50,663
I KNOW - IT'S SO HOT IN HERE.

220
00:14:50,697 --> 00:14:52,365
HAVE YOU BEEN DRINKING?

221
00:14:52,398 --> 00:14:54,334
NO. A,B,C,D -E...

222
00:14:58,304 --> 00:15:02,642
ECSTASY?! WHERE DID YOU GET ECSTASY FROM-?

223
00:15:02,675 --> 00:15:05,979
TOBY, J.T., ONE OF THEM -

224
00:15:06,012 --> 00:15:08,381
DO YOU KNOW HOW STUPID THAT IS?

225
00:15:08,414 --> 00:15:11,551
STOP BEING SO MELODRAMATIC. I'M HAVING FUN. YOU CAN, TOO.

226
00:15:11,584 --> 00:15:15,355
YOU NEED TO DRINK WATER. AND LOTS OF IT.

227
00:15:15,388 --> 00:15:16,723
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU'D TAKE E-!

228
00:15:16,756 --> 00:15:19,392
OKAY, CALM DOWN, DAD.

229
00:15:19,425 --> 00:15:21,227
PAIGE IS RIGHT, I NEED TO LOOSEN UP A LITTLE BIT.

230
00:15:21,261 --> 00:15:22,262
ASH -

231
00:15:23,229 --> 00:15:25,398
I'M GOING UPSTAIRS TO THE BATHROOM.

232
00:15:25,431 --> 00:15:28,501
I'LL DRINK SOME WATER. FROM THE TOILET.

233
00:15:36,175 --> 00:15:37,243
EMMA -

234
00:15:38,111 --> 00:15:38,511
EMMA.

235
00:15:40,446 --> 00:15:40,647
EMMA!

236
00:15:42,015 --> 00:15:43,483
SEAN, JUST LEAVE ME ALONE. IF I KNEW YOU WERE GONNA BE HERE

237
00:15:43,516 --> 00:15:45,451
I WOULD'VE STAYED HOME.

238
00:15:45,485 --> 00:15:47,420
I'LL GO FIND LIBERTY...

239
00:15:47,453 --> 00:15:49,155
EMMA. CAN WE TALK? PLEASE?

240
00:15:49,188 --> 00:15:50,423
THERE'S NOTHING TO TALK ABOUT.

241
00:15:50,456 --> 00:15:52,558
EMMA, YOU'RE NOT BEING FAIR -

242
00:15:52,592 --> 00:15:56,663
SEAN, YOU WENT TOO FAR. WE'RE OVER. AS IN FINISHED.

243
00:15:57,530 --> 00:15:58,498
SEAN!

244
00:16:00,667 --> 00:16:01,734
ARE YOU OKAY?

245
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:10,109
YOU NEED TO TALK TO SOMEONE. COME ON.

246
00:16:14,213 --> 00:16:15,448
IT'S JUST SO STUPID.

247
00:16:15,481 --> 00:16:18,284
I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE GOING THROUGH.

248
00:16:18,318 --> 00:16:19,252
HOW?

249
00:16:20,353 --> 00:16:21,454
OKAY, EVERYONE THINKS YOU'RE BAD, RIGHT?

250
00:16:21,487 --> 00:16:25,725
WELL EVERYONE THINKS I'M THIS PERFECT, BORING GIRL.

251
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:29,595
I JUST THOUGHT EMMA WAS SO DIFFERENT.

252
00:16:29,629 --> 00:16:33,533
WHY? SHE'S JUST LIKE JIMMY. SHE ONLY SEES...

253
00:16:33,566 --> 00:16:35,735
... WHAT SHE WANTS TO SEE.

254
00:16:35,768 --> 00:16:37,370
EXACTLY.

255
00:16:38,805 --> 00:16:40,807
OH, SEAN DON'T CRY.

256
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:42,041
DON'T CRY...

257
00:17:13,539 --> 00:17:15,274
HEY, JIMMY. HAVE YOU SEEN EMMA?

258
00:17:15,308 --> 00:17:16,542
THERE YOU ARE, MR. DRUG DEALER.

259
00:17:16,576 --> 00:17:17,777
WHAT -?

260
00:17:17,810 --> 00:17:19,779
DON'T YOU KNOW THAT 'E' LEADS TO HARDER THINGS?

261
00:17:19,812 --> 00:17:21,447
LIKE MY FISTS.

262
00:17:21,481 --> 00:17:22,749
WHAT DO YOU CARE IF I DID E?

263
00:17:22,782 --> 00:17:25,451
'CAUSE YOU DIDN'T. ASHLEY DID.

264
00:17:25,485 --> 00:17:27,787
AND SHE SAID SHE GOT IT FROM YOU.

265
00:17:27,820 --> 00:17:29,822
SEAN SWITCHED IT!

266
00:17:30,523 --> 00:17:32,392
SEAN? SEAN'S HERE?

267
00:17:32,425 --> 00:17:34,494
YEAH, HE'S UPSTAIRS.

268
00:17:45,138 --> 00:17:46,539
SEAN, WHA-?

269
00:17:47,874 --> 00:17:49,609
JIMMY. OH...

270
00:17:59,519 --> 00:18:01,788
EMMA? THERE YOU ARE.

271
00:18:04,457 --> 00:18:08,227
LOOK, IT WAS STUPID OF ME TO INVITE SEAN,

272
00:18:08,261 --> 00:18:13,199
AND I WANT YOU TO KNOW THE ONLY REASON I DID WAS BECAUSE --

273
00:18:38,758 --> 00:18:41,461
ONE, TWO, THREE - DIVE!

274
00:18:43,362 --> 00:18:44,764
WHERE IS SEAN?!

275
00:18:45,631 --> 00:18:46,599
JIMMY, STOP -!

276
00:18:46,632 --> 00:18:48,468
WHERE'S SEAN? SPINNER?

277
00:18:48,501 --> 00:18:50,937
HE LEFT, LIKE, 2 MINUTES AGO -

278
00:18:50,970 --> 00:18:52,705
JIMMY. STOP!

279
00:18:52,738 --> 00:18:55,208
OKAY, I KNOW YOU'RE UPSET, BUT WHAT JUST HAPPENED?

280
00:18:55,241 --> 00:18:57,944
WAS THE MOST INTENSE EXPERIENCE OF MY LIFE.

281
00:18:57,977 --> 00:19:00,179
IT WAS, LIKE THIS - THIS TELESCOPE. AND I SAW ME,

282
00:19:00,213 --> 00:19:01,280
THE REAL ME -

283
00:19:02,381 --> 00:19:04,484
LOOK. YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE SAYING -

284
00:19:04,517 --> 00:19:05,485
WHAT?

285
00:19:06,352 --> 00:19:08,421
IT'S NOT YOU. IT'S THE DRUGS.

286
00:19:08,454 --> 00:19:11,290
OH, OKAY, KEEP GOING, DAD. KEEP TELLING ME WHO I AM.

287
00:19:11,324 --> 00:19:12,725
ASH, LOOK -

288
00:19:13,493 --> 00:19:15,595
NO, NO, NO. THIS IS EXACTLY WHY ME AND SEAN JUST -

289
00:19:15,628 --> 00:19:17,430
HE GETS ME. YOU - ?

290
00:19:18,531 --> 00:19:19,732
ASH STOP THIS, AND COME WITH ME-

291
00:19:19,765 --> 00:19:25,204
TER, I LOVE YOUR SHIRT! IT'S SO SHINY! LIKE STARS!

292
00:19:25,238 --> 00:19:26,939
WHA-? I'M OUTTA HERE.

293
00:19:26,973 --> 00:19:29,308
WHAT I SHOULD HAVE DONE?

294
00:19:29,342 --> 00:19:32,545
IS BROKEN UP WITH YOU. ON YOUR BIRTHDAY. LIKE I WAS GOING TO.

295
00:19:32,578 --> 00:19:35,348
ASH, WOULD YOU JUST STOP BEING SUCH A HAG ALREADY.

296
00:19:35,381 --> 00:19:37,283
PAIGE, YOU ARE A HAG.

297
00:19:37,316 --> 00:19:41,320
ON TWO FRONTS - YOUR LOOKS AND YOUR PERSONALITY.

298
00:19:46,792 --> 00:19:50,596
OH, JIMMY, IT'S JUST - YOU DON'T HAVE WHAT SEAN HAS.

299
00:19:50,630 --> 00:19:54,567
AND YOU NEVER WILL. YOU'RE JUST - NOT ENOUGH FOR ME. SORRY.

300
00:19:57,870 --> 00:20:01,908
OH, AND NOW YOU'RE UPSET. DON'T BE, IT'S OKAY, IT IS.

301
00:20:01,941 --> 00:20:03,876
IT'S ALL GOOD, IT IS - !

302
00:20:03,910 --> 00:20:05,578
NICE, ASH.

303
00:20:07,046 --> 00:20:09,582
GUYS, WHERE ARE YOU GOING? C'MON, IT'S A PARTY.

304
00:20:09,615 --> 00:20:13,219
C'MON. WHERE'S EVERYONE GOING? C'MON, GUYS?

305
00:20:13,486 --> 00:20:14,453
GUYS?

306
00:20:15,454 --> 00:20:16,455
C'MON.

307
00:20:23,996 --> 00:20:25,565
WHEN DID THAT BREAK?

308
00:20:25,598 --> 00:20:27,667
WHEN YOU WERE DANCING WITH LIBERTY.

309
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:29,802
WHEN YOU WERE STRUNG OUT ON E.

310
00:20:29,835 --> 00:20:31,470
WHAT WERE YOU THINKING, ASH?

311
00:20:31,504 --> 00:20:32,638
WHAT WAS I THINKING?

312
00:20:32,672 --> 00:20:34,874
WHAT WERE YOU AND J.T. DOING WITH E IN THE FIRST PLACE?

313
00:20:34,907 --> 00:20:39,345
GUYS, IT DOESN'T MATTER.

314
00:20:39,378 --> 00:20:41,013
WAS I REALLY THAT BAD?

315
00:20:43,616 --> 00:20:46,052
WHAT IF I JUST CALL JIMMY -

316
00:20:46,085 --> 00:20:50,790
ASH, PAIGE WON'T TALK TO YOU. DO YOU REALLY THINK JIMMY WILL?

317
00:20:50,823 --> 00:20:52,692
I'M SUCH AN IDIOT!

318
00:20:52,725 --> 00:20:55,361
HOW AM I EVER GONNA FACE EVERYONE AGAIN?

319
00:20:55,394 --> 00:20:57,363
(KNOCK AT DOOR)

320
00:20:57,396 --> 00:20:59,665
JIMMY?

321
00:20:59,699 --> 00:21:03,402
HERE. JIMMY - DOESN'T WANT THIS STUFF ANYMORE.

322
00:21:03,436 --> 00:21:05,571
SPINNER, HOW IS HE -?

323
00:21:05,605 --> 00:21:07,974
JUST TAKE IT. AND DON'T CALL HIM.

324
00:21:12,712 --> 00:21:15,548
ASH -

325
00:21:16,816 --> 00:21:21,587
OH! IT'S TIME TO GET THIS PLACE CLEANED UP!

326
00:21:21,687 --> 00:21:22,922
THEY'LL BE HOME SOON!

327
00:21:22,955 --> 00:21:26,058
I MEAN COME ON! WE DIDN'T JUST-

328
00:21:26,092 --> 00:21:29,862
ASH? YOU OKAY?
