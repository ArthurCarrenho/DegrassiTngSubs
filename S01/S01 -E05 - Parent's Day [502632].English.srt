WE'RE TALKING SQUEEGEE KIDS.

57
00:02:51,612 --> 00:02:52,946
STALKING STREET CORNERS,

00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:55,549
WAITING TO POUNCE ON UNSUSPECTING CARS,

59
00:02:55,582 --> 00:03:00,354
HIJACKING YOUR HARD-EARNED CASH TO WASTE ON DRUGS AND TATTOOS.

60
00:03:00,387 --> 00:03:02,689
ARE SQUEEGEE KIDS LEGIT OR LAZY?

61
00:03:02,723 --> 00:03:04,291

SQUEEGEE KIDS ARE VERY ANNOYING.

66
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:22,242
NO! SQUEEGEE KIDS ARE POOR.

67
00:03:22,276 --> 00:03:24,011
THEY LIVE ON THE STREET AND THEY WASH WINDOWS.

68
00:03:24,044 --> 00:03:25,379
IT'S THEIR LIVING.

69
00:03:25,412 --> 00:03:28,415
MY FATHER SAYS THAT IF ANOTHER ONE OF THOSE RAGAMUFFINS

00:03:28,448 --> 00:03:29,983

71
00:03:30,017 --> 00:03:33,420
HE'LL CALL THE MAYOR. HE KNOWS THE MAYOR.

00:04:51,698 --> 00:04:52,966
TERRI YOU ROCK!

00:05:03,410 --> 00:05:06,413
J.T., COME ON. YOU'VE GOT TO COME UP AN ANTI-PARENTS PLAN.

00:05:06,446 --> 00:05:08,815
WHAT DOES IT LOOK LIKE I'M DOING?

101
00:05:08,849 --> 00:05:11,118
PLANTING SEEDS FOR A MASSIVE HEART ATTACK?

102
00:05:11,151 --> 00:05:13,987
TO PLOT EVIL I NEED ENERGY.

109
00:05:25,432 --> 00:05:26,833
YEAH? WHY?

110
00:05:27,534 --> 00:05:29,336
NO REASON.

111
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:31,471
WHAT WAS THAT ABOUT?

112
00:05:31,505 --> 00:05:32,606
I HAVE NO IDEA.

113
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:33,807
IT'S NOT LIKE PEOPLE REALLY THINK ABOUT IT.

114
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,942
THAT'S THE THING. THEY DON'T WANT US TO THINK.

115
00:05:35,976 --> 00:05:39,713
THEY WANT US TO BECOME BRAIN DEAD NAK ROBOTS.

116
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:41,114
WHAT'S WITH HER?

117
00:05:41,148 --> 00:05:44,484

120
00:05:50,524 --> 00:05:53,427
EMMA? WHO ARE YOU TALKING TO?

121
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:57,130
I COULD TALK. OR I COULD TAKE ACTION.

122
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:03,136
IMAGINE BEING HER FOR A DAY.

123
00:06:05,472 --> 00:06:07,641
OKAY, SO THEN THE GUY GOES:

124
00:06:07,674 --> 00:06:09,142
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO FOR A FACE

125
00:06:09,176 --> 00:06:13,046
WHEN THE MONKEY WANTS ITS BUTT BACK? (LAUGH)

126
00:06:15,148 --> 00:06:16,917
WHAT, YOU DON'T GET IT?

127
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:20,187
THE GUY HAS A FACE LIKE A MONKEY'S BUTT?

128
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:24,491

00:06:28,628 --> 00:06:30,197
OH, ASHLEY IS GETTING AN AGENT?

132
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:32,199
I COULD TOTALLY SEE HER ON TV.

133
00:06:32,232 --> 00:06:35,936
WHAT? AND YOU COULDN'T SEE ME?

134
00:06:35,969 --> 00:06:37,938
I DIDN'T SAY THAT.

135
00:06:37,971 --> 00:06:40,741
SO, YOU THINK I COULD GET AN AGENT TOO, RIGHT?

136
00:06:40,774 --> 00:06:44,578
YEAH, SURE - WHY NOT? OKAY, SO BACK TO MY JOKE.

137
00:06:44,611 --> 00:06:48,181

00:06:57,090 --> 00:06:58,658
NAK IS TOTALLY BIASED.

143
00:06:58,692 --> 00:07:00,827
THIS MORNING THEY TELL US SQUEEGEE KIDS SUCK.

144
00:07:00,861 --> 00:07:03,063
AND THEN THEY TELL US WHAT KIND OF RUNNING SHOES TO BUY?

145
00:07:03,096 --> 00:07:04,598
IT'S WRONG!

146
00:07:04,631 --> 00:07:07,501
HAVE YOU SEEN THE NEW COMPUTERS IN THE MEDIA IMMERSION LAB?

147
00:07:07,534 --> 00:07:10,837

150
00:07:14,674 --> 00:07:16,476

151
00:07:16,777 --> 00:07:18,512
NO. THAT'S EIGHTEEN NEW COMPUTERS

152
00:07:18,545 --> 00:07:20,480
WE WOULDN'T HAVE OTHERWISE.

153
00:07:20,514 --> 00:07:22,516
THE PARENTS VOTED FOR IT.

154
00:07:22,549 --> 00:07:23,250
REMEMBER, NOT EVERYONE AT DEGRASSI

155
00:07:23,283 --> 00:07:25,252
HAS A COMPUTER AT HOME.

156
00:07:25,285 --> 00:07:28,822
BUT, IF YOU FEEL STRONGLY ABOUT IT, WRITE AN OPINION PIECE.

157
00:07:28,855 --> 00:07:30,590
MAKE SURE YOU GET IT IN BY FOUR O'CLOCK.

158
00:07:30,624 --> 00:07:33,093

00:07:52,946 --> 00:07:54,881
UNLESS SHE SEES ME FIRST.

165
00:07:54,915 --> 00:07:56,216

166
00:07:56,249 --> 00:07:57,851

I CAN'T BELIEVE THE PRINCIPAL IS ASKING ME TO DO THIS.

171
00:08:12,632 --> 00:08:13,834
YOU'RE LIKE ATTACKING THE SCHOOL.

172
00:08:13,867 --> 00:08:16,570
I KNOW. IT'S VERY COOL.

173
00:08:20,574 --> 00:08:22,175
I'LL STAND.

174
00:08:25,312 --> 00:08:28,081
OKAY, SO LET'S TRY TO IMAGINE. YOU'RE A SQUEEGEE KID.

175
00:08:28,114 --> 00:08:30,016
OKAY, I'M A SQUEEGEE KID.

176
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:33,286
SO HOW DOES IT FEEL BEING COMPARED TO A COCKROACH?

177
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:38,058
I'D SAY, HEY PREPPY KIDS, GET OFF MY CASE, WHITE PEOPLE TOO.

178
00:08:38,091 --> 00:08:39,025
OH, PLEASE!

179
00:08:43,964 --> 00:08:46,700
COULD - WE NEED THE CHAIR...

180
00:08:54,341 --> 00:08:56,810
TALK ABOUT NEGATIVE ENERGY.

181
00:08:57,711 --> 00:08:59,813
EMMA IS RIGHT. I CAN WHINE

182
00:08:59,846 --> 00:09:02,682
OR I CAN DO SOMETHING ABOUT PARENTS' DAY.

183
00:09:02,716 --> 00:09:04,618
OKAY. SO, WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?

184
00:09:04,651 --> 00:09:07,921
CONVINCE MY PARENTS THAT THERE'S NO NEED TO SHOW UP.

185
00:09:07,954 --> 00:09:11,691
OKAY, I DOWNLOAD THE LOGO FROM THE DEGRASSI WEBSITE.

186
00:09:11,725 --> 00:09:13,727
THEN I SCAN MR. SIMPSON'S SIGNATURE

187
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:17,697
FROM THE LAST LETTER HE SENT HOME. IT'S A MASTERPIECE.

188
00:09:17,731 --> 00:09:20,000
MASTERPIECE FOR INSANITY.

189
00:09:20,033 --> 00:09:22,202
OKAY, PARENTS DON'T HAVE TO COME

190
00:09:22,235 --> 00:09:24,871
BECAUSE OF YOUR EXEMPLARY PERFORMANCE

191
00:09:24,905 --> 00:09:27,841
IN ALL OF YOUR SCHOLASTIC PURSUITS.

192
00:09:28,642 --> 00:09:28,842
WHAT?

193
00:09:29,709 --> 00:09:32,279
TRANSLATION. I'M ACING SCHOOL.

194
00:09:32,312 --> 00:09:34,714
IT'S ONLY DETAILS, MY FRIEND.

195
00:09:35,849 --> 00:09:38,718
THIS WILL WORK. IT HAS TO.

196
00:09:55,769 --> 00:09:59,239
LIBERTY, MY NAK EDITORIAL. I JUST FINISHED.

197
00:09:59,272 --> 00:10:01,341
YOU'RE SEVENTEEN MINUTES LATE!

198
00:10:01,374 --> 00:10:02,375
I'M SORRY.

199
00:10:02,409 --> 00:10:04,377
THE GRAPEVINE DEADLINE IS 4 P.M.

200
00:10:04,411 --> 00:10:06,880
I'M TRYING TO RUN A PROFESSIONAL OPERATION.

201
00:10:06,913 --> 00:10:09,716
EVEN PROFESSIONAL NEWSPAPERS GIVE EXTENSIONS.

202
00:10:09,749 --> 00:10:11,751
IT'S SEVENTEEN MINUTES.

203
00:10:11,785 --> 00:10:14,254
I SUPPOSE I CAN MAKE AN EXCEPTION - FOR YOU.

204
00:10:14,287 --> 00:10:16,756
BUT PLEASE, TRY NOT TO GET USED TO IT.

205
00:10:16,856 --> 00:10:21,628
REMEMBER, AS EDITOR I'M ONLY AS STRONG AS MY WEAKEST LINK.

206
00:10:23,997 --> 00:10:27,867
I WAS SHOCKED MORE THAN ANYONE. WHO KNEW I WAS DOING SO WELL?

207
00:10:27,901 --> 00:10:30,337
YOU KNOW, THIS TRANSFER TO DEGRASSI HAS REALLY-

208
00:10:30,370 --> 00:10:32,839
"I'VE LIFTED TOBY'S'S GRADE CLASSIFICATION

209
00:10:32,872 --> 00:10:34,808
TO A PREMIUM STANDARD."

210
00:10:36,176 --> 00:10:38,912
INTERESTING CHOICE OF WORDS FROM MR. SIMPSON.

211
00:10:38,945 --> 00:10:42,916
YOU KNOW, HE'S A COMPUTER GUY. WRITING ISN'T REALLY HIS THING.

212
00:10:42,949 --> 00:10:44,451
NEITHER IS SPELLING.

213
00:10:44,484 --> 00:10:46,086
TWO E'S IN PREMIUM.

214
00:10:50,957 --> 00:10:52,726
WHAT'S GOING ON?

215
00:10:52,759 --> 00:10:54,728
NOTHING'S GOING ON.

216
00:10:56,363 --> 00:10:58,832
YOU DON'T WANT ME TO GO TO PARENTS' DAY?

217
00:10:58,865 --> 00:10:59,833
I DIDN'T SAY THAT.

218
00:10:59,866 --> 00:11:02,035
YOU DIDN'T NEED TO.

219
00:11:04,137 --> 00:11:07,440
ARE YOU DOING THAT BADLY IN SCHOOL OR WHAT? -

220
00:11:07,474 --> 00:11:09,175
TALK TO ME, TOBY.

221
00:11:09,209 --> 00:11:12,846
MOM CALLED, OKAY? SHE WANTS TO GO TOMORROW.

222
00:11:12,879 --> 00:11:14,114
AND SHE DIDN'T EVEN TELL ME.

223
00:11:14,147 --> 00:11:16,716
YOU KNOW, THAT IS SO TYPICAL OF YOUR MOTHER. SHE JUST WANTS TO-

224
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:22,222
SEE? YOU GUYS CAN'T BE IN THE SAME ROOM WITHOUT FREAKING OUT!

225
00:11:27,827 --> 00:11:31,698
TOBY, WE'RE ON MUCH BETTER TERMS NOW.

226
00:11:32,465 --> 00:11:35,301
IT'S NOT LIKE IT USED TO BE.

227
00:11:36,069 --> 00:11:39,005
SO - WHAT? YOU DON'T WANT ME TO GO?

228
00:11:41,474 --> 00:11:45,311
I WANT YOU TO GO. AND I WANT HER TO GO.

229
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:50,750
I JUST DON'T WANT THE TWO OF YOU TO GO THERE - TOGETHER.

230
00:11:54,454 --> 00:11:59,859
HEY. COME ON, BUDDY. EVERYTHING IS GOING TO BE FINE.

231
00:12:00,894 --> 00:12:02,495
NO FIGHTS. PROMISE.

232
00:12:22,515 --> 00:12:24,250
LOOK AT ME. I'M SHAKING.

233
00:12:24,284 --> 00:12:25,118
YOU DO IT...

234
00:12:27,087 --> 00:12:28,354
OW! BE CAREFUL!

235
00:12:28,888 --> 00:12:31,224
IT'S MY EYE. IT'S WHAT I SEE WITH!

236
00:12:31,257 --> 00:12:33,393
SORRY. I'M NOT GOOD AT THIS.

237
00:12:33,426 --> 00:12:34,894
LADIES...

238
00:12:37,530 --> 00:12:38,932
WHY ARE YOU DRESSED LIKE THAT?

239
00:12:38,965 --> 00:12:42,569
IT'S PARENTS' DAY. I HAVE THE RIGHT TO LOOK FABULOUS DON'T I?

240
00:12:42,602 --> 00:12:47,307
FABULOUS? FOR WHO? THE PARENTS OR TOBY'S MOM?

241
00:12:47,841 --> 00:12:50,343
HM. SEE YOU OUT THERE.

242
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:02,122
I GUESS SHE FORGOT.

243
00:13:02,155 --> 00:13:03,256
YOU KNOW YOUR MOTHER.

244
00:13:03,289 --> 00:13:07,560
GIVE HER TWO MORE MINUTES. HEY TOBES, IT'LL BE FINE.

245
00:13:08,461 --> 00:13:11,598
MRS. STIMKOWSKI, ROOM 102.

246
00:13:11,631 --> 00:13:13,600
HI. CAN I HELP YOU?

247
00:13:13,633 --> 00:13:15,468
TERRI, THIS IS TOBY'S MOM,

248
00:13:15,502 --> 00:13:18,204
THE CASTING AGENT. WELCOME TO DEGRASSI, MS. ISAACS.

249
00:13:18,238 --> 00:13:19,506
HI.

250
00:13:19,539 --> 00:13:23,943
CAN I JUST SAY THAT IS A GREAT OUTFIT. SO AVANT-GARDE.

251
00:13:23,977 --> 00:13:27,514
OH, THANK YOU. HOLT RENFREW - ON SALE.

252
00:13:28,515 --> 00:13:30,283
HEY, MOM.

253
00:13:30,316 --> 00:13:33,486
HEY, TIGER. I'M SORRY I'M LATE.

254
00:13:35,622 --> 00:13:38,224
ANNE MARIE... FLAT TIRE?

255
00:13:39,492 --> 00:13:42,529
I TOLD TOBY THAT I MIGHT BE HELD UP AT WORK.

256
00:13:42,562 --> 00:13:45,598
PARENTS' DAY ISN'T OVER ALREADY IS IT?

257
00:13:45,632 --> 00:13:49,569
NO. NO. -- YOU BETTER GET MOVING THOUGH.

258
00:13:54,541 --> 00:13:56,976
PAIGE MICHAELCHUK. IT'S VERY NICE TO MEET YOU.

259
00:13:57,010 --> 00:13:59,412
I'VE HEARD SO MUCH ABOUT YOU.

260
00:14:02,615 --> 00:14:04,184
SMOOTH, MICHAELCHUK.

261
00:14:04,217 --> 00:14:06,519
BET YOU'RE ON THE NEXT FLIGHT TO HOLLYWOOD.

262
00:14:06,553 --> 00:14:08,521
HON, I'D RETHINK THE EYELINER.

263
00:14:08,555 --> 00:14:11,491
YOU'RE LOOKING A LITTLE WASHED OUT.

264
00:14:15,562 --> 00:14:18,131
THERE'S NO DOUBT TOBY'S A BRIGHT KID,

265
00:14:18,164 --> 00:14:18,998
BUT AH, HE HAS TROUBLE WITH DETAILS,

266
00:14:19,032 --> 00:14:20,533
PARTICULARLY HIS SPELLING

267
00:14:20,567 --> 00:14:23,636
AND SOME OF THE BASIC POINTS OF GRAMMAR.

268
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:26,472
THIS TENDS TO BRING DOWN HIS MARKS.

269
00:14:26,506 --> 00:14:28,241
FOR EXAMPLE, IN MEDIA IMMERSION,

270
00:14:28,274 --> 00:14:29,642
TOBY COULD BE AT THE TOP OF HIS CLASS

271
00:14:29,676 --> 00:14:31,611
IF HE JUST APPLIED HIMSELF.

272
00:14:31,644 --> 00:14:34,147
APPLY IS SUCH A RELATIVE TERM.

273
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:38,351
TOBY, COME ON. YOUR LAST MEDIA ASSIGNMENT WAS THREE DAYS LATE.

274
00:14:38,384 --> 00:14:39,452
HE'S JUST NOT GETTING THE RESULTS

275
00:14:39,485 --> 00:14:41,487
HE SHOULD FOR SOMEONE SO BRIGHT.

276
00:14:41,521 --> 00:14:43,623
THREE DAYS LATE?

277
00:14:43,656 --> 00:14:45,925
THE FIRST I'VE HEARD OF IT. TOBY?

278
00:14:45,959 --> 00:14:48,261
JEFF? I'M TALKING TO YOU.

279
00:14:48,294 --> 00:14:50,663
THIS IS PARENTS' DAY. YOU'RE THE PARENT.

280
00:14:50,697 --> 00:14:52,365
WE'RE BOTH THE PARENTS HERE.

281
00:14:52,398 --> 00:14:54,601
AND WE'LL DISCUSS IT LATER, OKAY?

282
00:14:54,634 --> 00:14:56,202
WE WILL DISCUSS IT NOW.

283
00:14:56,236 --> 00:14:59,005
WHY AREN'T YOU HELPING TOBY GET HIS WORK IN ON TIME?

284
00:14:59,038 --> 00:15:01,207
WHY IS HE UNDER-ACHIEVING?

285
00:15:03,076 --> 00:15:05,144
TOBY AND I WILL WORK IT OUT.

286
00:15:05,178 --> 00:15:08,514
THANKS FOR BRINGING IT TO OUR ATTENTION.

287
00:15:13,653 --> 00:15:18,591
I'M SO PROUD OF YOU. RAVE REVIEW AFTER RAVE REVIEW.

288
00:15:19,359 --> 00:15:21,427
MOM, MY EDITORIAL!

289
00:15:22,562 --> 00:15:25,331
SO WHAT, YOU HAVE TO WATCH THIS VIDEO EVERY MORNING?

290
00:15:25,365 --> 00:15:27,533
A FREE COMPUTER IS A FREE COMPUTER, MAN.

291
00:15:27,567 --> 00:15:28,568
WHAT IDIOT WROTE THIS?

292
00:15:28,601 --> 00:15:31,604
EXCUSE ME? I WROTE THAT.

293
00:15:31,638 --> 00:15:33,373
OH, SORRY, I WAS -

294
00:15:33,406 --> 00:15:35,608
DON'T LOOK AT HER. IT'S MY PIECE AND I'M RIGHT.

295
00:15:35,642 --> 00:15:37,677
STUDENTS SHOULDN'T BE FORCE FED ADVERTISING

296
00:15:37,710 --> 00:15:39,679
WHEN WE'RE AT SCHOOL.

297
00:15:39,712 --> 00:15:41,648
IF YOU DON'T GET IT, YOU'RE THE IDIOT.

298
00:15:41,681 --> 00:15:43,316
EMMA...

299
00:15:43,349 --> 00:15:45,118
LOOK, IT'S NOT THAT SERIOUS.

300
00:15:45,151 --> 00:15:48,054
WHAT!? EXPRESSING MY OPINION ISN'T IMPORTANT?

301
00:15:48,087 --> 00:15:49,589
THAT'S ALL MY BROTHER IS TRYING TO DO.

302
00:15:49,622 --> 00:15:51,658
I COULD TELL. AND HE'S WRONG!

303
00:15:51,691 --> 00:15:56,062
I'M WRONG? TELL ME, IS IT FAIR OR IS IT WRONG

304
00:15:56,095 --> 00:15:58,131
THAT SEAN HERE HAS FALLEN BEHIND IN SCHOOL

305
00:15:58,164 --> 00:16:01,100
BECAUSE WE CAN'T AFFORD A COMPUTER.

306
00:16:01,801 --> 00:16:03,670
HE CAN DO HIS HOMEWORK HERE.

307
00:16:03,703 --> 00:16:05,638
WHAT, YEAH, ON THE FREE COMPUTERS HUH?

308
00:16:05,672 --> 00:16:08,141
IF YOU READ THE ENTIRE ARTICLE, YOU WOULD KNOW THAT-

309
00:16:08,174 --> 00:16:09,075
THAT IT'S A PIECE OF GARBAGE.

310
00:16:09,108 --> 00:16:11,177
IT IS NOT GARBAGE!

311
00:16:13,813 --> 00:16:18,751
IT LOOKS LIKE GARBAGE TO ME. IT SMELLS LIKE GARBAGE.

312
00:16:19,619 --> 00:16:21,654
ALL I'M TRYING TO SAY IS THERE'S TWO SIDES

313
00:16:21,688 --> 00:16:23,323
TO EVERY STORY.

314
00:16:23,356 --> 00:16:25,758
TRY TO REMEMBER THAT NEXT TIME.

315
00:16:33,733 --> 00:16:37,203
IT WAS ONLY ONCE. BUT STILL,

316
00:16:37,236 --> 00:16:41,074
SKIPPING A CLASS EVEN ONCE AT THIS GRADE LEVEL -

317
00:16:41,107 --> 00:16:43,242
WHAT IS GOING ON HERE?!

318
00:16:43,276 --> 00:16:46,446
ONE CLASS. I GOT CARRIED AWAY IN THE COMPUTER LAB.

319
00:16:46,479 --> 00:16:48,348
I THOUGHT MOVING IN WITH YOU AND JUNE CLEAVER

320
00:16:48,381 --> 00:16:50,383
WAS SUPPOSED TO BE GOOD FOR TOBY'S GRADES.

321
00:16:50,416 --> 00:16:51,551
WASN'T THAT THE POINT?

322
00:16:51,584 --> 00:16:52,151
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

323
00:16:52,185 --> 00:16:53,720
DAD, COME ON.

324
00:16:53,753 --> 00:16:55,154
I'M SAYING MAYBE WE NEED TO REASSESS

325
00:16:55,188 --> 00:16:57,690
TOBY'S LIVING ARRANGEMENTS.

326
00:16:57,724 --> 00:16:59,325
DON'T THREATEN ME.

327
00:16:59,359 --> 00:17:00,760
HEY, THAT'S YOUR GAME.

328
00:17:00,793 --> 00:17:03,262
WHAT? AND BREAKING COMMITMENTS IS YOURS?

329
00:17:03,296 --> 00:17:05,098
THAT'S WHY TOBY LIVES WITH ME.

330
00:17:05,131 --> 00:17:06,466
MR. AND MRS. ISAACS,

331
00:17:06,499 --> 00:17:08,434
THESE ARE COMMON PROBLEMS FOR MANY STUDENTS.

332
00:17:08,468 --> 00:17:09,702
SO IT'S MY FAULT?

333
00:17:09,736 --> 00:17:12,672
JEFF, LET'S NOT EVEN GET INTO THE REASONS WHY I LEFT, OKAY?

334
00:17:12,705 --> 00:17:16,409
REASONS WHY YOU LEFT? THERE'S ONLY ONE REASON, ANNE MARIE.

335
00:17:16,442 --> 00:17:19,712
YOUR CAREER. YOUR CAREER THAT MEANT SO MUCH MORE TO YOU

336
00:17:19,746 --> 00:17:20,780
THAN WE EVER DID.

337
00:17:20,813 --> 00:17:23,449
THAT'S WHY TOBY LIVES WITH ME AND HE'LL NEVER -

338
00:17:23,483 --> 00:17:26,519
MOM! DAD! YEAH, MY ASSIGNMENT WAS LATE!

339
00:17:26,552 --> 00:17:28,688
WHO'S TO BLAME? VIDEO GAMES.

340
00:17:28,721 --> 00:17:31,491
I'M TELLING YOU, THEY'RE DESTROYING MY GENERATION!

341
00:17:31,524 --> 00:17:32,658
TOBY, THIS ISN'T A JOKE.

342
00:17:32,692 --> 00:17:36,796
I'M NOT JOKING, OKAY? I DON'T HAVE AN EXCUSE.

343
00:17:36,829 --> 00:17:38,431
BUT DAD CAN'T DO MY HOMEWORK FOR ME

344
00:17:38,464 --> 00:17:40,666
OR MAKE SURE I GO TO CLASS.

345
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:43,836
IT'S MY LIFE, RIGHT? SO IT'S MY PROBLEM.

346
00:17:44,737 --> 00:17:46,572
STOP BLAMING EACH OTHER

347
00:17:46,606 --> 00:17:49,876
AND THEN USING ME AS ANOTHER EXCUSE TO ARGUE.

348
00:17:49,909 --> 00:17:54,280
BECAUSE IT'S NOT FAIR! I'LL TRY HARDER. I PROMISE.

349
00:17:58,851 --> 00:18:02,221
MOVING ON? ALRIGHT THEN,

350
00:18:02,789 --> 00:18:08,127
LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT SOME OF THE RECENT TEST RESULTS.

351
00:18:12,698 --> 00:18:15,268
OH HEY, HOW DID IT GO IN THERE?

352
00:18:15,301 --> 00:18:17,904
OH, AH, IT WENT AH, OKAY.

353
00:18:17,937 --> 00:18:19,739
TOBY JUST HAS TO APPLY HIMSELF MORE.

354
00:18:19,772 --> 00:18:20,840
YEAH, WE'RE GOING TO MAKE SURE

355
00:18:20,873 --> 00:18:24,210
THAT HE DOES HIS HOMEWORK ON TIME. BUT IT WENT OKAY.

356
00:18:24,243 --> 00:18:27,313
TOBY, HON, THAT'S SO - GREAT.

357
00:18:29,615 --> 00:18:31,784
HONEY LISTEN, I GOTTA RUN.

358
00:18:32,485 --> 00:18:33,753
GOTTA GET BACK TO WORK HUH?

359
00:18:33,786 --> 00:18:36,389
YEAH. BUT HEY, LISTEN.

360
00:18:36,856 --> 00:18:39,659
YOUR MESSAGE CAME IN LOUD AND CLEAR BACK THERE.

361
00:18:39,692 --> 00:18:41,627
TOBY, I'M REALLY SORRY.

362
00:18:42,895 --> 00:18:47,533
ALL THE STUFF BETWEEN YOUR DAD AND ME, IT'S TOUGH.

363
00:18:47,567 --> 00:18:48,768
I KNOW.

364
00:18:48,801 --> 00:18:51,604
HEY, I LOVE YOU SO MUCH.

365
00:18:52,338 --> 00:18:56,909
ASHLEY, YOU HAVE MY PERMISSION TO KEEP THIS MONKEY INLINE.

366
00:18:56,943 --> 00:18:59,212
OH I WILL DON'T YOU WORRY.

367
00:18:59,245 --> 00:19:00,313
AND IT WAS A PLEASURE TO SEE YOU AGAIN.

368
00:19:00,346 --> 00:19:03,249
AN ABSOLUTE JOY. BY THE WAY AH-

369
00:19:03,282 --> 00:19:06,886
I HAVE SOMETHING TO REMEMBER ME BY.

370
00:19:17,396 --> 00:19:18,798
IF YOU'RE INTERESTED IN ACTING, GIVE ME A CALL

371
00:19:18,831 --> 00:19:22,768
YOU HAVE AN INTERESTING LOOK.

372
00:20:04,610 --> 00:20:06,546
I'M SORRY TOO.

373
00:20:06,579 --> 00:20:09,715
I'M A LITTLE OUTSPOKEN. IT RUNS IN THE FAMILY.

374
00:20:09,749 --> 00:20:12,685
MAYBE IT'S CONTAGIOUS. DID YOU HEAR MY BROTHER?

375
00:20:12,718 --> 00:20:13,819
LOOKS LIKE GARBAGE.

376
00:20:13,853 --> 00:20:16,322
SMELLS LIKE GARBAGE...

377
00:20:22,028 --> 00:20:23,729
IT WASN'T GARBAGE.

378
00:20:25,898 --> 00:20:26,699
THANKS.

379
00:20:36,509 --> 00:20:41,614
TOBY? CAN I SPEAK WITH YOU FOR A MINUTE? LISTEN, YESTERDAY-

380
00:20:41,647 --> 00:20:44,684
I JUST WANT TO APOLOGIZE AGAIN FOR MY PARENTS' BEHAVIOUR.

381
00:20:44,717 --> 00:20:49,956
TOBY, IT WASN'T YOUR FAULT. ARE THEY ALWAYS LIKE THAT?

382
00:20:49,989 --> 00:20:53,960
ONLY WHEN THEY'RE TOGETHER. ACTUALLY, MR. SIMPSON,

383
00:20:53,993 --> 00:20:57,463
YESTERDAY WAS GOOD. IT CLEARED A LOT OF AIR.

384
00:20:57,496 --> 00:21:01,634
I'M GLAD. OH, LISTEN, BEFORE I FORGET,

385
00:21:03,436 --> 00:21:06,305
NEXT TIME YOU WANT TO FORGE MY SIGNATURE,

386
00:21:06,339 --> 00:21:08,608
MAYBE YOU SHOULD SPELL MY NAME CORRECTLY.

387
00:21:08,641 --> 00:21:11,644
AND ERASE THE FILE FROM THE SERVER!

388
00:21:11,677 --> 00:21:12,945
MR. SIMPSON, I CAN EXPLAIN.

389
00:21:12,979 --> 00:21:14,647
GOOD. WHY DON'T YOU START WITH A TEN PAGE ESSAY

390
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:16,349
ON WHY IT'S WRONG TO FALSIFY DOCUMENTS -

391
00:21:16,382 --> 00:21:18,384
SAY BY TOMORROW MORNING.

392
00:21:21,954 --> 00:21:24,757
YOU KNOW WHAT, ONE FINAL THING.

393
00:21:25,424 --> 00:21:26,892
GOOD WORK YESTERDAY.

394
00:21:27,627 --> 00:21:32,331
YOUR PARENTS SHOULD BE PROUD OF YOU. I CERTAINLY WAS.
