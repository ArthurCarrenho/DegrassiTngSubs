00:00:11,185 --> 00:00:12,586
HEY - WANT TO HEAR SOMETHING COOL?

2
00:00:12,619 --> 00:00:14,455
A PROTECTION CHANT.

3
00:00:14,488 --> 00:00:16,423
TERRI, I'M SORTA BUSY RIGHT NOW -

4
00:00:16,457 --> 00:00:18,559
'I CALL UPON MY ANGELIC GUARDIANS.

5
00:00:18,592 --> 00:00:20,794
I CALL UPON MY SPIRIT GUIDES -'

6
00:00:20,828 --> 00:00:23,297
I CALL UPON TERRI TO STOP FREAKING ME OUT.

7
00:00:23,330 --> 00:00:25,632
WHY'D YOU PICK THAT TOPIC FOR YOUR PRESENTATION, ANYWAY?

8
00:00:25,666 --> 00:00:28,135
I LOVE THIS MYSTIC ORACLE STUFF.

9
00:00:28,168 --> 00:00:29,737
GIVES ME THE CREEPS.

10
00:00:29,770 --> 00:00:32,339
ANYWAY. I THINK I'VE GOT THE SONG DOWN. FINALLY.

11
00:00:32,373 --> 00:00:33,474
LISTEN.

12
00:00:34,875 --> 00:00:37,478

WOW. WE ARE SO GOING TO BE THE STARS OF THE CABARET.

17
00:00:56,663 --> 00:00:59,533
AH, I THOUGHT WE WERE GOING TO PICK UP THE SONG'S PACE A BIT?

18
00:00:59,566 --> 00:01:02,836
THIS IS THE RIGHT PACE. YOU KNOW THAT, RIGHT?

19
00:01:02,870 --> 00:01:03,704
UH...SURE.

20
00:01:04,671 --> 00:01:05,539
I JUST THOUGHT WE WERE SUPPOSED TO BE A DUO.

21
00:01:05,572 --> 00:01:08,242
YOU COULD SING THIS SONG ON YOUR OWN.

22
00:01:08,275 --> 00:01:11,845
WE ARE A DUO - SING ALONG THIS TIME.

35
00:02:02,396 --> 00:02:04,164
ARE YOU SERIOUS ABOUT PERFORMING

36
00:02:04,198 --> 00:02:05,566
AT LUNCHTIME CABARET?

37
00:02:05,599 --> 00:02:08,402
THEN YOU NEED TO SIGN UP WITH ME BY NOON TODAY.

38
00:02:08,435 --> 00:02:10,404
I'LL DECIDE IF YOUR ACT IS APPROPRIATE.

39
00:02:10,437 --> 00:02:12,773
AND UP TO OUR USUAL STANDARDS.

40
00:02:12,806 --> 00:02:17,211
TER? WE SHOULD TOTALLY HOOK UP FOR THE CABARET.

41
00:02:17,244 --> 00:02:18,879
I'M ALREADY DOING A DUO WITH ASH -

42
00:02:18,912 --> 00:02:20,447
"TWO GIRLS AND A KEYBOARD".

43
00:02:20,481 --> 00:02:21,615
HON, THAT SOUNDS LAMER THAN

44
00:02:21,648 --> 00:02:23,851
HEATHER SINCLAIR'S HIGHLAND SWORD DANCE.

45
00:02:23,884 --> 00:02:27,621
I KNOW. BUT THE SONG ASH WROTE MEANS THE WORLD TO HER.

46
00:02:27,654 --> 00:02:30,224
TOO BAD IT'S JUST - BLAH.

47
00:02:30,257 --> 00:02:31,492
THEN YOU NEED ME.

48
00:02:31,525 --> 00:02:33,393
TO JAZZ IT UP, ADD SOME STYLE.

49
00:02:33,427 --> 00:02:35,629
I TRIED TO GET HER TO DO THAT ALREADY, BUT SHE WON'T.

50
00:02:35,662 --> 00:02:39,466
SHE WON'T? IT'S A DUET, NOT A DICTATORSHIP.

51
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:43,337
JUST TELL HER YOU WANT A POPPIER SONG. AND A TRIO!

52
00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:46,240
GOOD MORNING INSPIRING SCHOLARS.

53
00:02:46,273 --> 00:02:48,442
IN LIGHT OF MS. KWAN'S CONTINUED ABSENCE

54
00:02:48,475 --> 00:02:50,577
I GOING TO BE YOUR HOMEROOM TEACHER AGAIN TODAY.

55
00:02:50,611 --> 00:02:51,478
(GROANS)

56
00:02:54,381 --> 00:02:56,316
PLEASE TAKE YOUR SEATS.

57
00:02:58,418 --> 00:02:59,953
THIS CABARET'S GOING TO BE THE BEST ONE.

58
00:02:59,987 --> 00:03:02,756
JUST WAIT TILL THEY HEAR OUR SONG.

59
00:03:02,789 --> 00:03:03,323
ASH?

60
00:03:04,458 --> 00:03:04,858
YEAH.

61
00:03:07,728 --> 00:03:09,530
YEAH. CAN'T WAIT...

62
00:03:15,302 --> 00:03:17,771
IT'S A POETIC DANCE ON AN ENVIRONMENTAL THEME, SEAN.

63
00:03:17,804 --> 00:03:19,406
YOU'LL LOVE IT.

64
00:03:19,439 --> 00:03:20,574
I DON'T DANCE.

65
00:03:20,607 --> 00:03:22,409
YOU DON'T HAVE TO DANCE. MANNY AND I WILL DANCE.

66
00:03:22,442 --> 00:03:24,011
I JUST WANT YOU TO BE THE HUNTER.

67
00:03:24,044 --> 00:03:25,779
I DON'T WEAR LEOTARDS.

68
00:03:25,812 --> 00:03:27,281
WE DON'T WEAR LEOTARDS.

69
00:03:27,314 --> 00:03:28,815
JUST BLACK, LIKE PANTHERS.

70
00:03:28,849 --> 00:03:30,584
IN HONOUR OF OUR BASKETBALL TEAM.

71
00:03:30,617 --> 00:03:32,352
AND BECAUSE THEY'RE ENDANGERED.

72
00:03:32,386 --> 00:03:33,854
IN OUR PIECE WE'RE GUNNED DOWN BY A HUNTER.

73
00:03:33,887 --> 00:03:35,489
IT HAS A STRONG MESSAGE.

74
00:03:35,522 --> 00:03:36,390
I DON'T HUNT.

75
00:03:41,762 --> 00:03:43,497
I CAN'T BELIEVE SEAN WON'T DO IT.

76
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:45,299
IT'S GONNA BE SO GOOD.

77
00:03:45,332 --> 00:03:46,700
THE AUDIENCE WILL BE ENTERTAINED

78
00:03:46,733 --> 00:03:47,801
AND LEARN SOMETHING IN THE PROCESS.

79
00:03:47,834 --> 00:03:49,536
LEOTARDS AND LEARNING DON'T GO TOGETHER.

80
00:03:49,570 --> 00:03:51,471
LEOTARDS AND LAUGHTER DO.

81
00:03:51,505 --> 00:03:52,539
YOU ARE SO PRIMITIVE.

82
00:03:52,573 --> 00:03:54,274
WHO'RE WE GONNA GET TO BE THE HUNTER?

83
00:03:54,308 --> 00:03:55,475
WE'LL FIND SOMEBODY.

84
00:03:55,509 --> 00:03:56,476
I'LL DO IT.

85
00:03:56,510 --> 00:03:57,911
WHAT?

86
00:03:57,945 --> 00:04:01,014
REALLY? TOBY, YOU'RE THE BEST.

87
00:04:01,048 --> 00:04:03,283
EH, I DO WHAT I CAN...

88
00:04:03,317 --> 00:04:04,751
WE REHEARSE AFTER SCHOOL IN THE GYM.

89
00:04:04,785 --> 00:04:06,520
SEE YOU THERE.

90
00:04:09,323 --> 00:04:11,391
WOW - I THINK IT'S COOL WHEN GUYS GET IN TOUCH

91
00:04:11,425 --> 00:04:12,726
WITH THEIR FEMININE SIDE.

92
00:04:12,759 --> 00:04:15,996
'COURSE YOU DO, J.T. LOOK AT YOU.

93
00:04:16,029 --> 00:04:17,297
HA-HA. FUNNY.

94
00:04:20,434 --> 00:04:21,835
THERE ARE MANY 'MYSTIC ORACLES'

95
00:04:21,868 --> 00:04:24,938
BUT TAROT AND OUIJA ARE MY FAVOURITE.

96
00:04:26,473 --> 00:04:28,508
NOW - CAN I HAVE A VOLUNTEER?

97
00:04:28,542 --> 00:04:31,278
MADAME TERRI? I'LL DO IT.

98
00:04:35,349 --> 00:04:37,517
TAKE A DEEP BREATH.

99
00:04:37,551 --> 00:04:40,020
WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO ASK THE ORACLE?

100
00:04:40,053 --> 00:04:41,655
OKAY, UH - GREAT MYSTIC ORACLE...

101
00:04:41,688 --> 00:04:43,924
AM I REALLY A SUPER STUD?

102
00:04:43,957 --> 00:04:45,726
YOU DON'T NEED AN ORACLE TO ANSWER THAT ONE, GAVIN.

103
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:49,029
ASK ANOTHER - SERIOUS QUESTION, PLEASE.

104
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:53,500
WHAT WAS THE NAME OF MY FIRST PET?

105
00:04:54,534 --> 00:04:57,504
'I CALL UPON MY ANGELIC GUARDIANS.

106
00:04:57,537 --> 00:05:00,474
I CALL UPON MY SPIRIT GUIDES'

107
00:05:01,541 --> 00:05:03,377
-R-

108
00:05:03,410 --> 00:05:06,346
-O-

109
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:08,348
-C-

110
00:05:08,382 --> 00:05:11,018
-K-

111
00:05:11,051 --> 00:05:14,855
-Y-

112
00:05:14,888 --> 00:05:17,357
ROCKY. HOW DID YOU KNOW...?

113
00:05:17,758 --> 00:05:21,094
THAT'S COOL! AND, UH, JUST A BIT CREEPY.

114
00:05:22,062 --> 00:05:23,463
THAT WAS QUITE SOMETHING, TERRI,

115
00:05:23,497 --> 00:05:24,765
EXCELLENT USE OF POWER POINT.

116
00:05:24,798 --> 00:05:25,999
YOU'VE EARNED TOP MARKS.

117
00:05:26,033 --> 00:05:31,071
JUST AS WELL - I DON'T WANT THE MYSTIC ORACLES AGAINST ME.

118
00:05:31,104 --> 00:05:34,608
ASH, YOU DON'T REALLY BELIEVE IN THIS STUFF DO YOU?

119
00:05:34,641 --> 00:05:35,876
IN THE REAL STUFF, YEAH.

120
00:05:35,909 --> 00:05:41,148
MY AUNT PREDICTED MY GRANDMA'S STROKE. BY READING TEA LEAVES.

121
00:05:41,181 --> 00:05:45,152
SO IF YOU HEARD A PREDICTION - ONE THAT AFFECTED YOU,

122
00:05:45,185 --> 00:05:46,486
YOU'D BELIEVE IT?

123
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:49,456
YEAH I'D BE STUPID NOT TO.

124
00:05:51,591 --> 00:05:52,926
YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW TO DANCE.

125
00:05:52,959 --> 00:05:54,795
I DON'T HAVE TO. I'M JUST HUNTING.

126
00:05:54,828 --> 00:05:56,663
YOU'RE DOING THIS JUST TO GET CLOSE TO EMMA.

127
00:05:56,697 --> 00:05:57,664
DUH.

128
00:05:57,698 --> 00:06:00,100
NEWSFLASH TOBY - SHE HAS A BOYFRIEND.

129
00:06:00,133 --> 00:06:04,471
WHO REFUSED TO DANCE. SO WHO'S THE HERO NOW?!

130
00:06:09,543 --> 00:06:10,877
SO - I'M A FOOL?

131
00:06:12,212 --> 00:06:15,449
NO. IN TAROT, THE FOOL REPRESENTS FATE.

132
00:06:15,482 --> 00:06:18,452
WHAT'S IMPORTANT IS THAT IT'S UPSIDE-DOWN.

133
00:06:18,485 --> 00:06:21,154
MEANS YOUR DAY WILL END UNEXPECTEDLY. WITH A TWIST.

134
00:06:21,188 --> 00:06:24,458
A TWIST? WHAT IS THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

135
00:06:24,491 --> 00:06:26,793
IT MEANS YOU SHOULD WATCH OUT.

136
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,503
YES, PAGE? WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO KNOW?

137
00:06:36,536 --> 00:06:38,772
OH, MYSTIC ORACLE, SHOULD 'TWO GIRLS AND A PIANO' -

138
00:06:38,805 --> 00:06:40,207
BECOME A TRIO?

139
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,908
PAGE. IT'S 'TWO GIRLS AND A KEYBOARD'.

140
00:06:41,942 --> 00:06:43,477
AND NO. WE'RE FINE.

141
00:06:43,510 --> 00:06:44,444
YOU SHOULD ASK.

142
00:06:44,478 --> 00:06:48,148
IF YOU'RE RIGHT THE ORACLE WILL BACK YOU UP.

143
00:07:08,168 --> 00:07:09,770
WOW, THREE OF RODS?

144
00:07:11,538 --> 00:07:13,940
RODS REPRESENTS CREATIVITY - OUR BAND.

145
00:07:13,974 --> 00:07:15,142
AND THE THREE...?

146
00:07:15,175 --> 00:07:17,010
THE ORACLE HAS SPOKEN.

147
00:07:22,916 --> 00:07:24,551
THE ORACLE HAS SPOKEN.

148
00:07:24,584 --> 00:07:25,652
THE ORACLE DID SPEAK.

149
00:07:25,685 --> 00:07:26,887
PAGE SHOULD JOIN THE BAND.

150
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:29,189
SOUNDS LIKE YOU WANT HER TO JOIN.

151
00:07:29,222 --> 00:07:31,091
TER, SHE'LL MAKE IT ALL "SEXY" AND STUPID.

152
00:07:31,124 --> 00:07:32,392
SHE'LL WRECK EVERYTHING.

153
00:07:32,425 --> 00:07:35,162
I THOUGHT YOU SAID YOU TOTALLY BELIEVED IN THE ORACLES.

154
00:07:35,195 --> 00:07:37,831
I DO. BUT MY AUNT WAS AN EXPERT. YOU'RE - AN AMATEUR.

155
00:07:37,864 --> 00:07:40,267
WAS I AN AMATEUR WHEN I FOUND OUT SPINNERS PETS NAME?

156
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:42,235
PLEASE. SPINNER TOLD YOU ABOUT HIS CAT ROCKY,

157
00:07:42,269 --> 00:07:43,703
LIKE, A MONTH AGO.

158
00:07:43,737 --> 00:07:44,671
HOW DO YOU KNOW?

159
00:07:44,704 --> 00:07:47,507
I WAS THERE. REMEMBER?

160
00:07:54,981 --> 00:07:56,716
I CAN'T BELIEVE SHE DIDN'T BUY IT.

161
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:58,084
SHE SAID I WAS AN AMATEUR.

162
00:07:58,118 --> 00:08:00,086
AND SHE THINKS YOUR STYLE WILL LIKE, CLASH.

163
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:02,122
ME? CLASH? AS IF.

164
00:08:03,056 --> 00:08:05,292
DON'T TELL ME YOU AGREE WITH HER.

165
00:08:05,325 --> 00:08:07,260
THEN TELL HER YOU DON'T AGREE.

166
00:08:07,294 --> 00:08:09,296
WHAT'S THE WORST THAT CAN HAPPEN?

167
00:08:09,329 --> 00:08:11,198
PAGE - I KNOW YOU WANT TO BE IN THE BAND -

168
00:08:11,231 --> 00:08:13,033
NO, I KNOW THE BAND NEEDS ME.

169
00:08:13,066 --> 00:08:13,900
BUT 'TWO GIRLS AND A KEYBOARD'

170
00:08:13,934 --> 00:08:17,003
IS GOING TO REMAIN JUST THAT. SORRY.

171
00:08:17,037 --> 00:08:18,905
WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT ADDING A JETE?

172
00:08:18,939 --> 00:08:20,674
SOMETHING LIKE THIS -

173
00:08:21,942 --> 00:08:22,542
OWWWWW!

174
00:08:28,615 --> 00:08:30,650
CAN YOU STAND ON IT AT ALL?

175
00:08:30,684 --> 00:08:32,052
OWWWWW!

176
00:08:32,085 --> 00:08:33,687
IT'S ALREADY STARTING TO SWELL.

177
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:35,222
WE SHOULD PROVABLY TAKE YOU TO THE NURSE.

178
00:08:35,255 --> 00:08:37,958
I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS. HOW AM I GOING TO DANCE?

179
00:08:37,991 --> 00:08:40,594
HOW AM I GOING TO BE A PANTHER?

180
00:08:42,128 --> 00:08:43,864
TER - YOU PREDICTED A TWIST.

181
00:08:43,897 --> 00:08:45,665
AND SHE JUST TWISTED HER ANKLE.

182
00:08:45,699 --> 00:08:48,268
SHE DID. I CAN'T BELIEVE SHE DID.

183
00:08:48,301 --> 00:08:51,137
AND YOU WERE RIGHT ABOUT ME.

184
00:08:51,171 --> 00:08:53,006
WHO AM I TO ARGUE WITH THE ORACLES?

185
00:08:53,039 --> 00:08:54,574
YOU'RE IN, PAGE.

186
00:08:55,275 --> 00:08:56,676
YES, TER? AREN'T YOU HAPPY?

187
00:08:56,710 --> 00:09:00,213
TOTALLY. I JUST CAN'T BELIEVE I PREDICTED THAT. I AM CREEPY.

188
00:09:07,854 --> 00:09:09,856
EVEN I'M AMAZED AT MY BRILLIANCE!

189
00:09:09,890 --> 00:09:13,627
'PAGE MICHALCHUK AND THE SEXKITTENS'? PLEASE.

190
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:14,895
WHAT'S WRONG WITH IT?

191
00:09:14,928 --> 00:09:17,030
WHY DON'T WE MAKE IT 'THREE GIRLS AND A KEYBOARD'?

192
00:09:17,063 --> 00:09:18,198
NICE AND SIMPLE.

193
00:09:18,231 --> 00:09:19,766
NICE AND BORING.

194
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:22,269
TER. WHAT DO YOU THINK?

195
00:09:22,302 --> 00:09:23,637
'THREE GIRLS AND A KEYBOARD'.

196
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:26,339
OR 'PAGE MICHALCHUK AND THE SEXKITTENS'?

197
00:09:26,373 --> 00:09:28,642
THEY'RE BOTH... INTERESTING.

198
00:09:28,675 --> 00:09:32,979
TER. YOU DON'T LIKE 'THREE GIRLS AND A KEYBOARD'. DO YOU?

199
00:09:33,013 --> 00:09:35,949
I THINK WE SHOULD JUST FOCUS ON GETTING THE SONG DOWN.

200
00:09:35,982 --> 00:09:37,617
THE NAME WILL COME LATER.

201
00:09:37,651 --> 00:09:40,253
FINE. - HERE'S OUR SONG ON CD.

202
00:09:40,287 --> 00:09:44,090
LEARN IT. AND MEET US AT THE WALL AT 4, TO PRACTICE.

203
00:09:44,124 --> 00:09:47,127
ALRIGHT, SETTLE EVERYONE.

204
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:49,829
LET'S CONTINUE WITH OUR DISCUSSION FROM LAST CLASS.

205
00:09:49,863 --> 00:09:52,699
WE TALKED ABOUT SENTENCE AND PARAGRAPH STRUCTURES -

206
00:09:52,732 --> 00:09:57,203
USING SHORT, EMPHATIC SENTENCES, SHAPING THE CLAUSES,

207
00:09:57,237 --> 00:09:59,673
HOLDING KEY THOUGHTS UNTIL THE VERY END

208
00:09:59,706 --> 00:10:02,842
OF YOUR SENTENCE STRUCTURE...

209
00:10:03,310 --> 00:10:05,078
ALL WE'D HAVE TO DO IS ADJUST SOME OF THE DANCING

210
00:10:05,111 --> 00:10:07,847
TONE IT DOWN. MANNY CAN BE THE HUNTER -

211
00:10:07,881 --> 00:10:10,417
I DON'T KNOW, EM. I'M NOT EXACTLY THE BEST DANCER.

212
00:10:10,450 --> 00:10:12,786
I THINK IT'S A GREAT IDEA. REALLY.

213
00:10:12,819 --> 00:10:14,788
I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE IT PERFORMED.

214
00:10:14,821 --> 00:10:17,157
PLAYING THE HUNTER IS ONE THING, BUT DANCING -

215
00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:18,925
YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE WHO'S BEEN AT EVERY REHEARSAL.

216
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:19,859
YOU KNOW THE PART.

217
00:10:19,893 --> 00:10:21,261
OF THE HUNTER.

218
00:10:21,294 --> 00:10:25,031
WHY CAN'T WE JUST HAVE TWO HUNTERS, AND ONE PANTHER?

219
00:10:25,065 --> 00:10:26,766
JUST FORGET IT.

220
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:30,136
I'LL GO TELL LIBERTY WE'RE NOT GOING ON.

221
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,842
FINE. I'LL DO IT.

222
00:10:36,843 --> 00:10:38,278
BUT I'M NOT WEARING LEOTARDS.

223
00:10:38,311 --> 00:10:42,048
YOU DON'T HAVE TO. TOBY THANK YOU. I MEAN IT.

224
00:10:52,459 --> 00:10:54,260
OKAY, READY?

225
00:11:00,133 --> 00:11:00,834
VOILA!

226
00:11:02,002 --> 00:11:05,372
WOW. THAT'S AN INCREDIBLE LOOK, FOR YOU.

227
00:11:05,405 --> 00:11:06,473
AND YOU.

228
00:11:06,506 --> 00:11:08,742
I DON'T THINK SO. I'D LOOK LIKE A SAUSAGE.

229
00:11:08,775 --> 00:11:10,377
SILLY - YOU'LL LOOK GREAT.

230
00:11:10,410 --> 00:11:13,046
WE'RE SO GOING TO GET A RECORD DEAL!

231
00:11:13,079 --> 00:11:16,149
ESPECIALLY AFTER YOU HEAR MY IDEAS FOR THE SONG -

232
00:11:16,182 --> 00:11:17,450
HAVE YOU LISTENED TO IT YET?

233
00:11:17,484 --> 00:11:18,818
YEAH.

234
00:11:18,852 --> 00:11:19,252
AND...?

235
00:11:20,253 --> 00:11:23,156
WELL IT HAS PROMISE. BUT RIGHT NOW?

236
00:11:23,189 --> 00:11:26,026
SOUNDS LIKE A BUNCH OF COWS DYING.

237
00:11:27,861 --> 00:11:29,729
PAGE, WHAT ARE YOU WEARING?

238
00:11:29,763 --> 00:11:30,930
OUR NEW LOOK. YOU LIKE?

239
00:11:30,964 --> 00:11:34,134
I DON'T. YOU WANT US TO LOOK LIKE PROSTITUTES?

240
00:11:34,167 --> 00:11:37,771
FINE. I'LL GET US SOME NUN COSTUMES.

241
00:11:37,804 --> 00:11:39,005
VERY FUNNY, PAGE.

242
00:11:44,911 --> 00:11:46,413
SHE'S HOLDING US BACK...

243
00:11:46,446 --> 00:11:47,681
I'VE TRIED, PAGE -

244
00:11:47,714 --> 00:11:51,017
AND FAILED. LISTEN - I HAVE SOME IDEAS FOR THE SONG.

245
00:11:51,051 --> 00:11:52,952
BUT ASHLEY IS GONNA HATE THEM.

246
00:11:52,986 --> 00:11:55,221
WE NEED THE MYSTIC ORACLES TO CONVINCE HER.

247
00:11:55,255 --> 00:11:59,526
AFTER MANNY? I'M NOT MESSING WITH THE ORACLES AGAIN. BUT...

248
00:11:59,559 --> 00:12:00,627
BUT WHAT?

249
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:02,796
WHAT IF YOU AND I JUST TRIED YOUR IDEAS?

250
00:12:02,829 --> 00:12:03,863
MADE A NEW VERSION OF THE SONG.

251
00:12:03,897 --> 00:12:05,498
MAYBE ASH WOULD LIKE IT.

252
00:12:05,532 --> 00:12:08,802
THAT'S A BIG MAYBE. HUGE. BUT - OKAY.

253
00:12:09,502 --> 00:12:12,172
AND I THINK I KNOW EXACTLY WHO CAN HELP US.

254
00:12:12,205 --> 00:12:14,040
I JUST HAVE TO CHANGE.

255
00:12:15,842 --> 00:12:17,444
MR. SIMPSON? THIS SYNTHESIZER.

256
00:12:17,477 --> 00:12:19,779
YOU TALKED ABOUT IT IN CLASS ONCE, DIDN'T YOU?

257
00:12:19,813 --> 00:12:20,213
RIGHT.

258
00:12:21,314 --> 00:12:22,415
WELL - WE WEREN'T REALLY PAYING ATTENTION.

259
00:12:22,449 --> 00:12:24,184
BUT WE WISH WE WERE.

260
00:12:24,217 --> 00:12:25,518
BECAUSE WE HAVE THIS SONG HERE.

261
00:12:25,552 --> 00:12:28,321
AND WE'D LIKE TO DO ANOTHER VERSION OF IT.

262
00:12:28,354 --> 00:12:29,823
WELL YOU CAME TO THE RIGHT PLACE.

263
00:12:29,856 --> 00:12:31,925
THIS SETUP HERE IS AMAZING.

264
00:12:32,826 --> 00:12:35,361
WISH I HAD IT BACK WHEN I WAS IN A BAND.

265
00:12:35,395 --> 00:12:39,899
STOP. REWIND. MR. SIMPSON - YOU WERE IN A BAND?

266
00:12:40,934 --> 00:12:42,802
THE ZIT REMEDY.

267
00:12:42,836 --> 00:12:44,537
WE EVEN HAD A VIDEO.

268
00:12:44,571 --> 00:12:46,506
YOU EVER HEARD OF US?

269
00:12:47,173 --> 00:12:49,509
♪ EVERYBODY WANTS SOMETHING...

270
00:12:51,611 --> 00:12:52,445
I'LL TAKE THAT AS A NO.

271

LET ME SHOW YOU HOW THIS WORKS. OKAY?

272
00:13:10,096 --> 00:13:11,564
TOBY - THAT'S YOUR CUE.

273
00:13:11,598 --> 00:13:13,199
OH, SORRY.

274
00:13:20,874 --> 00:13:21,875
OUCH!

275
00:13:22,942 --> 00:13:24,878
J.T., STOP THE MUSIC.

276
00:13:25,545 --> 00:13:27,614
TOBY- YOU KEEP LEANING IN THE WRONG WAY.

277
00:13:27,647 --> 00:13:29,516
GREAT. UHM, SORRY.

278
00:13:31,351 --> 00:13:33,019
YOU WANNA TRY AGAIN?

279
00:13:33,052 --> 00:13:36,589
NO. I THINK I'VE HAD ENOUGH HEAD INJURIES FOR TODAY.

280
00:13:36,623 --> 00:13:37,457
OKAY...

281
00:13:37,490 --> 00:13:38,324
MAYBE YOU SHOULD TRY IT AT HOME

282
00:13:38,358 --> 00:13:40,460
IN FRONT OF THE MIRROR OR SOMETHING.

283
00:13:40,493 --> 00:13:41,494
SURE.

J.T. SHUT UP, NOW.

00:13:59,179 --> 00:14:03,883
THAT'S PERFECT, MR. SIMPSON. IT'S SO DANCEABLE.

I DON'T BELIEVE THIS. YOU GUYS RE-DID MY SONG.

295
00:14:40,286 --> 00:14:42,021
ASHLEY- IT'S JUST AN ALTERNATE TAKE.

296
00:14:42,055 --> 00:14:43,489
BOTH VERSIONS ARE STILL ON THE COMPUTER.

297
00:14:43,523 --> 00:14:45,525
SO THERE'S NO PROBLEM.

NO PAGE, I DON'T KNOW.

301
00:14:51,564 --> 00:14:54,300
FIRST THE NAME. THEN THE CLOTHES. NOW MY MUSIC?

302
00:14:54,334 --> 00:14:55,535
FORGET IT.

303
00:14:55,568 --> 00:14:57,503
WELL, I SAY WE GO WITH OUR VERSION. RIGHT, TERRI?

304
00:14:57,537 --> 00:14:59,005
TER, THERE'S NO ARGUMENT.

305
00:14:59,038 --> 00:15:02,308
YOU KNOW THE SONG WAS BETTER BEFORE.

306
00:15:02,342 --> 00:15:03,643
I - I DON'T KNOW.

307
00:15:03,676 --> 00:15:05,545
YOU SHOULD LET THE ORACLE DECIDE.

308
00:15:05,578 --> 00:15:07,981
WE CAN ALL AGREE ON THAT.

309
00:15:08,014 --> 00:15:12,085
AFTER ALL, TERRI IS IN TOUCH WITH THE OTHER SIDE.

310
00:15:13,119 --> 00:15:15,955
...OKAY. WE'LL CONSULT THE ORACLE.

311
00:15:19,592 --> 00:15:23,529
MYSTIC ORACLE? WHICH VERSION SHOULD WE GO WITH?

312
00:15:26,733 --> 00:15:29,102
HIGH PRIESTESS. IT MEANS -

313
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:34,540
GO WITH THE NEW.

314
00:15:34,574 --> 00:15:38,111
SORRY, ASH. THE ORACLE HAS SPOKEN.

315
00:15:46,719 --> 00:15:49,589
LUNCHTIME CABARET WILL BE COMMENCING SHORTLY.

316
00:15:49,622 --> 00:15:50,690
THOSE INTERESTED IN ATTENDING

317
00:15:50,723 --> 00:15:52,759
SHOULD MAKE THEIR WAY TO THE GYM.

318
00:15:52,792 --> 00:15:55,328
AND STILL FELL THAT I'M FREE

319
00:15:57,530 --> 00:15:59,198
FREE TO BE WHO I AM.

320
00:16:01,634 --> 00:16:03,736
DID SOMEONE MISS THE ANNOUNCEMENT?

321
00:16:03,770 --> 00:16:07,073
WE'RE GOING ON IN LIKE FIVE MINUTES, ASH.

322
00:16:07,106 --> 00:16:10,643
I DID SOME INTERNET RESEARCH ON YOUR LAST READING.

323
00:16:10,677 --> 00:16:13,279
'HIGH PRIESTESS' MEANS STAY WITH THE OLD.

324
00:16:13,313 --> 00:16:17,050
YOU SAID GO WITH THE NEW. YOU LIED, TER. WHY?

325
00:16:22,355 --> 00:16:24,557
BECAUSE YOU HATE ALL OF MY SUGGESTIONS.

326
00:16:24,590 --> 00:16:25,792
THAT IS SO NOT TRUE -

327
00:16:25,825 --> 00:16:29,095
IT IS. I DON'T GET A SAY. IN ANYTHING.

328
00:16:29,128 --> 00:16:30,596
IT'S NOT FAIR!

329
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:35,401
WELCOME TO LUNCHTIME CABARET.

337
00:17:40,566 --> 00:17:42,568
(Laughing)

338
00:17:50,543 --> 00:17:53,546
HEY. SHUT UP. LET THEM DANCE.

339
00:18:01,187 --> 00:18:03,589

THAT WASN'T SO BAD, WAS IT?

364
00:19:55,334 --> 00:19:58,938
NO. BUT MY PANTHER-DANCING DAYS ARE OVER.

365
00:19:58,971 --> 00:20:03,009
UNLESS A CERTAIN SOMEONE ASKS YOU AGAIN, RIGHT...?

366
00:20:03,042 --> 00:20:06,712
HEY, TOBY. YOU WERE GREAT OUT THERE. THANK YOU SO MUCH.

I'LL BE RIGHT BACK, OKAY?

369
00:20:15,054 --> 00:20:17,623
SEAN. I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY.

370
00:20:17,657 --> 00:20:19,325
YOU DON'T HAVE TO SAY ANYTHING.

371
00:20:19,358 --> 00:20:20,927
THE WAY YOU JUST STOOD UP LIKE THAT.

372
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:23,896
TOLD EVERYONE OFF. IT WAS SO BRAVE.

373
00:20:31,804 --> 00:20:33,372
OKAY, WE WERE AWESOME!

374
00:20:33,406 --> 00:20:37,343
I COULD TOTALLY DO THIS FOR A LIVING.

375
00:20:42,682 --> 00:20:43,749
SO...?

376
00:20:44,617 --> 00:20:46,352
YOU GUYS WERE GREAT.

377
00:20:46,385 --> 00:20:47,386
REALLY?

378
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:49,388
I ADMIT IT. YOUR VERSION TOTALLY ROCKED.

379
00:20:49,422 --> 00:20:51,924
AND THE AUDIENCE LOVED IT.

380
00:20:51,958 --> 00:20:55,328
I THINK YOU SHOULD JOIN THE WITH THE GROUP AGAIN.

381
00:20:55,361 --> 00:20:57,830
OKAY. BUT FIRST THINGS FIRST - WHAT ABOUT THE NAME?

382
00:20:57,863 --> 00:21:00,466
WELL, THERE'S ALWAYS PAGE MICHALCHUK AND THE SEXKITTENS -

383
00:21:00,499 --> 00:21:01,701
NO!

384
00:21:01,734 --> 00:21:03,469
HELLO? LET ME FINISH.

385
00:21:03,502 --> 00:21:06,772
I'M TALKING ABOUT THE INITIALS: P-M-S.

386
00:21:08,808 --> 00:21:09,875
PMS?!

387
00:21:09,909 --> 00:21:11,510
WHAT? IT'S EDGY, COOL.

388
00:21:11,544 --> 00:21:13,079

389
00:21:13,112 --> 00:21:14,914
LET'S JUST STICK WITH "THREE GIRLS AND A KEYBOARD"

390
00:21:14,947 --> 00:21:15,982
NO WAY!

391
00:21:16,015 --> 00:21:16,616
TER - IT'S ONE-TO-ONE.

392
00:21:16,649 --> 00:21:18,351
YOUR VOTE BREAKS THE TIE.

393
00:21:18,384 --> 00:21:21,087
MAYBE YOU SHOULD CONSULT THE ORACLE?

394
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:25,858
THE ORACLE AND I ARE NO LONGER ON SPEAKING TERMS.

395
00:21:27,393 --> 00:21:29,428
BUT, I SORTA LIKE PMS.

396
00:21:30,563 --> 00:21:31,731
FINE.

397
00:21:32,531 --> 00:21:34,600
THEN - WE ARE PMS!
