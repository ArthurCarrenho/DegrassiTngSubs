00:00:08,615 --> 00:00:09,650
SO AM I.

6
00:00:09,683 --> 00:00:11,452
SHOULD BE A LOT OF FUN.

7
00:00:11,485 --> 00:00:13,620

00:00:25,466 --> 00:00:26,867
LIKE I ASKED YOU TO, RIGHT?

15
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:29,303
I'M SORRY KATE, I JUST CAN'T REMEMBER THINGS LIKE THAT.

16
00:00:29,336 --> 00:00:31,372
COME ONE, THAT'S AN EXCUSE TOBY WOULD MAKE.

17
00:00:31,405 --> 00:00:35,209
OH KATE COME ON, YOU GONNA COMPARE-

18
00:00:35,242 --> 00:00:36,543

00:00:57,264 --> 00:00:59,066
WOW. VERY CHI-CHI.

SO - DID YOU TALK ABOUT ANYTHING ELSE,

29
00:01:03,137 --> 00:01:05,072
OR JUST LIFE IN LONDON?

30
00:01:06,273 --> 00:01:09,243
NO. WHY, WAS THERE SOMETHING ELSE?

31
00:01:09,276 --> 00:01:10,110

BUT - YESTERDAY, AFTER MY DAD DROPPED ME OFF,

60
00:02:49,877 --> 00:02:51,578

00:08:18,772 --> 00:08:20,607
LIBERTY, I FORGOT TO TELL YOU.

185
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:23,710
I CAN'T COME TO THE INTERVIEW TONIGHT.

186
00:08:24,811 --> 00:08:26,680
TOBY AND I'VE GOT --

187
00:08:29,282 --> 00:08:31,651
-- DANCE LESSONS TONIGHT.

188
00:08:31,685 --> 00:08:34,955
RIGHT. TONIGHT IT'S - BALLROOM.

189
00:08:37,023 --> 00:08:38,859
OH, I GET IT! IT'S A JOKE!

190
00:08:38,892 --> 00:08:40,694
J.T., YOU ARE BEYOND FUNNY.

191
00:08:40,727 --> 00:08:42,796
DANCE LESSONS-WITH A BOY!

192
00:08:44,931 --> 00:08:48,702
ANYWAY, LET'S USE YOUR HUMOUR IN THE ARTICLE.

193
00:08:48,735 --> 00:08:50,670
BUT IF YOU EVER WANT TO TAKE ACTUAL DANCE LESSONS,

194
00:08:50,704 --> 00:08:52,105
YOU SHOULD LOOK ME UP...

195
00:08:52,138 --> 00:08:53,306
HELP ME!

196
00:09:00,313 --> 00:09:02,015
HERE WE GO.

197
00:09:02,048 --> 00:09:04,851
THANKS AGAIN FOR TALKING TO OUR CLASS TODAY, DAD.

198
00:09:04,885 --> 00:09:07,087
HAVE I TOLD YOU HOW HAPPY I AM THAT YOU'VE MOVED BACK?

199
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,623
I'M HAPPY TOO, ASH.

200
00:09:09,656 --> 00:09:10,724
ASHLEY, CAN WE -

201
00:09:13,393 --> 00:09:15,695
I THOUGHT I HEARD A CAR.

202
00:09:15,729 --> 00:09:16,730
HEY, ROBERT.

203
00:09:16,763 --> 00:09:19,799
WOW - YOU LOOK GREAT!

204
00:09:19,833 --> 00:09:23,637
I'M HOLDING A BAG OF GARBAGE...

205
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:25,372
ASH - THERE'S ONE MORE BAG IN THE GARAGE.

206
00:09:25,405 --> 00:09:27,641
COULD YOU GO GET IT, WHILE YOUR DAD AND I CATCH UP?

207
00:09:27,674 --> 00:09:27,974
SURE.

208
00:09:32,746 --> 00:09:34,915
DAD - WE'RE STILL ON FOR SUNDAY, RIGHT?

209
00:09:34,948 --> 00:09:36,082
DEFINITELY.

210
00:09:36,116 --> 00:09:36,816
GREAT.

211
00:09:48,962 --> 00:09:50,730
YOU KNOW, THE OLDER YOUR DAD GETS,

212
00:09:50,764 --> 00:09:53,833
THE HANDSOMER HE BECOMES. LUCKY GUY.

213
00:09:54,868 --> 00:09:57,737
EVERYONE AT SCHOOL LOVED HIM TODAY.

214
00:09:57,771 --> 00:09:59,706
EVERYBODY ALWAYS LOVES HIM.

215
00:09:59,739 --> 00:10:02,008
HE'S THE MOST CHARMING MAN ON THE PLANET.

216
00:10:02,042 --> 00:10:03,410
YOU STILL THINK SO?

217
00:10:03,443 --> 00:10:05,111
AFTER EVERYTHING YOU GUYS'VE BEEN THROUGH?

218
00:10:05,145 --> 00:10:06,846
OF COURSE.

219
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:09,215
YOUR DAD AND I STILL CARE ABOUT EACH OTHER.

220
00:10:09,249 --> 00:10:10,584
YOU KNOW THAT, ASH.

221
00:10:10,617 --> 00:10:14,854
GEE, ALMOST SOUNDS LIKE YOU WANT TO GET BACK TOGETHER...

222
00:10:14,888 --> 00:10:16,823
GET BACK TOGETHER? NO.

223
00:10:16,856 --> 00:10:18,158
WHAT MAKES YOU SAY THAT?

224
00:10:18,191 --> 00:10:19,426
I DON'T KNOW,

225
00:10:19,459 --> 00:10:21,761
YOU GUYS HAVE BEEN ACTING LIKE THERE'S SOME BIG SECRET LATELY.

226
00:10:21,795 --> 00:10:25,999
I JUST THOUGHT, MAYBE IT WAS SOMETHING ABOUT YOU TWO.

227
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,868
WHAT, IS THERE SOMETHING?

228
00:10:31,805 --> 00:10:32,005
ASH -

229
00:10:32,939 --> 00:10:35,375
HE HASN'T FOUND SOME OTHER WOMAN, HAS HE?

230
00:10:35,408 --> 00:10:36,309
HE'S NOT GETTING MARRIED -

231
00:10:36,343 --> 00:10:36,810
NO.

232
00:10:37,477 --> 00:10:39,145
WELL, THEN WHAT?

233
00:10:39,179 --> 00:10:43,249
IS HE GAY? IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO TELL ME?

234
00:10:45,352 --> 00:10:49,022
ASH, THERE ARE THINGS YOUR DAD AND I SHOULD'VE TALKED TO YOU

235
00:10:49,055 --> 00:10:50,957
ABOUT A LONG TIME AGO -

236
00:10:50,991 --> 00:10:52,826
MOM, I WAS JOKING -

237
00:10:52,859 --> 00:10:55,462
IT'S NOT A JOKE.

238
00:10:55,495 --> 00:10:56,830
YOUR DAD IS GAY.

239
00:11:03,970 --> 00:11:05,338
I'M SORRY, I JUST DON'T GET IT.

240
00:11:05,372 --> 00:11:08,375
HOW CAN ASH'S DAD, LIKE, DO IT WITH OTHER GUYS?

241
00:11:08,408 --> 00:11:10,810
NOT ONLY THAT, HOW DOES HE DO IT -?!

242
00:11:10,844 --> 00:11:13,179
I DON'T KNOW, J.T. I DIDN'T ASK.

243
00:11:13,213 --> 00:11:16,082
WOMEN OKAY - REAL WOMEN, NOT GIRLS? - ARE SEXY.

244
00:11:16,116 --> 00:11:16,883
BUT GUYS...

245
00:11:16,916 --> 00:11:19,419
I MEAN, WE HAVE MUSCLES. WE SMELL.

246
00:11:19,452 --> 00:11:20,286
WE HAVE BODY HAIR.

247
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,921
YOU WISH.

248
00:11:21,955 --> 00:11:23,323
WOMEN CAN HAVE BODY HAIR, TOO.

249
00:11:23,356 --> 00:11:24,391
MY AUNT BETTINA HAS THIS MOUSTACHE -

250
00:11:24,424 --> 00:11:26,326
THAT'S NOT WHAT I MEAN.

251
00:11:26,359 --> 00:11:27,927
I DON'T KNOW, J.T.

252
00:11:27,961 --> 00:11:30,797
SOME PEOPLE ARE JUST GAY, I GUESS.

253
00:11:31,798 --> 00:11:33,333
SO - HOW DID YOUR INTERVIEW WITH LIBERTY GO?

254
00:11:33,366 --> 00:11:35,201
DON'T ASK. DON'T TELL.

255
00:11:42,375 --> 00:11:45,412
HEY, ASH - CAN I JOIN YOU?

256
00:11:50,150 --> 00:11:52,052
IS EVERYTHING OKAY?

257
00:11:52,085 --> 00:11:54,287
YEAH. EVERYTHING'S FINE.

258
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:57,390
YOU'VE BEEN ACTING WEIRD ALL DAY...

259
00:11:57,424 --> 00:12:00,427
I FOUND OUT SOMETHING ABOUT MY DAD -

260
00:12:01,428 --> 00:12:04,197
HEY ASH, IS EVERYTHING OKAY?

261
00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:05,498
PAIGE, WE'RE TALKING -

262
00:12:05,532 --> 00:12:09,235
PERFECT. 'CAUSE I WANT TO TALK ABOUT SOMETHING TOO -

263
00:12:09,269 --> 00:12:11,438
PAIGE, I'M REALLY NOT IN THE MOOD -

264
00:12:11,471 --> 00:12:13,306
- CONCERNING YOUR DAD.

265
00:12:14,074 --> 00:12:15,308
WHAT ABOUT HIM?

266
00:12:15,341 --> 00:12:17,310
OKAY, I WAS THINKING.

267
00:12:17,343 --> 00:12:21,281
ROBERT KERWIN - HANDSOME, STYLISH, CHARMING, SUCCESSFUL.

268
00:12:21,314 --> 00:12:25,251
A TOTAL CATCH, RIGHT? AND YET - STILL SINGLE?

269
00:12:25,919 --> 00:12:27,420
WHAT'S YOUR POINT?

270
00:12:28,288 --> 00:12:30,824
WELL - HE COULD STILL BE HUNG UP ON YOUR MOM.

271
00:12:30,857 --> 00:12:34,127
OR - AND I'M SURE THIS ISN'T THE CASE -

272
00:12:36,229 --> 00:12:40,366
BUT HAVE YOU EVER WONDERED IF MAYBE IF YOUR DAD'S GAY?

273
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:42,368
IT WOULD EXPLAIN A LOT.

274
00:12:42,402 --> 00:12:43,570
IS THAT SUPPOSED TO BE A JOKE?

275
00:12:43,603 --> 00:12:44,871
NO, HON, NO -

276
00:12:48,108 --> 00:12:52,512
YOU JUST BETTER MIND YOUR OWN BUSINESS FOR ONCE, PAIGE.

277
00:12:54,047 --> 00:12:55,548
BUT - MY OLDEST BROTHER'S GAY,

278
00:12:55,582 --> 00:12:58,384
TER, I WAS JUST TRYING TO HELP!

279
00:13:05,859 --> 00:13:10,263
♪♪♪

280
00:13:13,399 --> 00:13:16,903
DON'T YOU THINK I'M MAKING HEADWAY WITH J.T.?

281
00:13:16,936 --> 00:13:17,804
WOULDN'T IT BE SOMETHING

282
00:13:17,837 --> 00:13:20,273
IF WE BECAME THE NEW JIMMY AND ASHLEY?

283
00:13:20,306 --> 00:13:22,609
YEAH - SOMETHING.

284
00:13:22,642 --> 00:13:25,044
YOU THINK I SHOULD ASK HIM OUT?

285
00:13:25,078 --> 00:13:26,312
OR IS THAT EVEN OKAY TO DO?

286
00:13:26,346 --> 00:13:27,480
SURE.

287
00:13:27,514 --> 00:13:29,182
IF YOU THINK HE LIKES YOU BACK.

288
00:13:29,215 --> 00:13:31,518
YOU DON'T THINK J.T. LIKES ME?

289
00:13:32,252 --> 00:13:36,389
J.T.'S A BOY. WHO KNOWS WHAT'S GOING ON IN HIS HEAD?

290
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:48,234
OKAY, THAT'S IT!

291
00:13:48,968 --> 00:13:50,637
I'VE STOOD HER UP, I'VE IGNORED HER,

292
00:13:50,670 --> 00:13:54,474
I'VE BEEN VERY RUDE TO HER - AND SHE WILL NOT TAKE A HINT!

293
00:13:54,507 --> 00:13:58,878
THEN TELL HER, POINT-BLANK, YOU'RE NOT INTERESTED.

294
00:13:58,912 --> 00:14:02,348
OKAY, THIS MAY SOUND DESPERATE, BUT - IT'S A PLAN.

295
00:14:02,382 --> 00:14:04,984
REMEMBER THAT LITTLE TALK WE HAD ABOUT ASHLEY'S DAD,

296
00:14:05,018 --> 00:14:06,352
AND HIS 'ORIENTATION'...?

297
00:14:06,386 --> 00:14:07,187
YEAH...

298
00:14:08,288 --> 00:14:10,590
WELL YOU KNOW WHAT COMING OUT DID TO HIS MARRIAGE.

299
00:14:10,623 --> 00:14:14,194
WHAT IF I, UH, "CAME OUT" TO LIBERTY?

300
00:14:14,227 --> 00:14:14,427
UH...

301
00:14:16,396 --> 00:14:18,998
IT'D WORK. YOU KNOW IT WOULD.

302
00:14:28,341 --> 00:14:29,008
ASHLEY -

303
00:14:30,443 --> 00:14:32,145
I HAVE TO GET TO CLASS.

304
00:14:32,178 --> 00:14:34,547
I'VE SIGNED YOU OUT THE REST OF THE AFTERNOON.

305
00:14:34,581 --> 00:14:37,517
ASH, WE NEED TO TALK. PLEASE.

306
00:14:43,122 --> 00:14:46,192
LIBERTY! WAIT UP! WE NEED TO TALK.

307
00:14:46,226 --> 00:14:49,629
I COULDN'T AGREE MORE. YOU FIRST.

308
00:14:53,233 --> 00:14:54,601
YOU'LL BE THE ONLY PERSON WHO KNOWS

309
00:14:54,634 --> 00:14:56,603
WHAT I'M ABOUT TO TELL YOU,

310
00:14:56,636 --> 00:14:58,504
AND I'D LIKE TO KEEP IT THAT WAY. OKAY?

311
00:14:58,538 --> 00:15:01,241
SO DO YOU PROMISE YOU CAN KEEP A SECRET?

312
00:15:01,274 --> 00:15:02,508
OKAY, I PROMISE.

313
00:15:02,542 --> 00:15:04,444
CROSS YOUR HEART, HOPE TO DIE PROMISE?

314
00:15:04,477 --> 00:15:06,079
YES, WHAT IS IT?!

315
00:15:09,115 --> 00:15:09,582
I'M GAY.

316
00:15:13,319 --> 00:15:13,620
WHAT?!

317
00:15:14,687 --> 00:15:17,223
I LIKE BOYS. NOT GIRLS. GAY.

318
00:15:19,592 --> 00:15:21,160
YOU'RE - YOU'RE JOKING.

319
00:15:21,194 --> 00:15:23,229
NO I'M NOT.

320
00:15:23,263 --> 00:15:27,734
AND I THOUGHT YOU SHOULD KNOW, SINCE, YOU THINK WE-

321
00:15:27,767 --> 00:15:30,103
YOU THOUGHT I HAD A CRUSH ON YOU?

322
00:15:30,136 --> 00:15:32,305
PLEASE. OF COURSE I DON'T.

323
00:15:35,108 --> 00:15:40,179
OKAY, WELL - GREAT. IT'S A LOT EASIER THAN I THOUGHT IT'D BE.

324
00:15:41,447 --> 00:15:42,615
YOU WANTED TO TALK ABOUT SOMETHING?

325
00:15:42,649 --> 00:15:47,353
NO, IT'S - NOT IMPORTANT. BUT THANKS FOR LETTING ME KNOW.

326
00:15:47,387 --> 00:15:49,522
IT'S, UH, OUR LITTLE SECRET.

327
00:15:55,295 --> 00:15:56,763
WERE YOU EVER PLANNING TO TELL ME?

328
00:15:56,796 --> 00:16:00,733
ASH, YOU WERE TOO YOUNG TO UNDERSTAND -

329
00:16:00,767 --> 00:16:02,769
TOO YOUNG? WHEN YOU LEFT US, OKAY.

330
00:16:02,802 --> 00:16:05,405
BUT YOU GUYS HAD FIVE YEARS -

331
00:16:07,573 --> 00:16:10,543
WE DIDN'T HANDLE THIS CORRECTLY, I ADMIT.

332
00:16:10,576 --> 00:16:12,245
BUT WE THOUGHT IT'D BE BEST IF WE WAITED

333
00:16:12,278 --> 00:16:13,513
'TIL YOU WERE OLDER.

334
00:16:13,546 --> 00:16:16,149
GUESS WHAT? I'M OLDER.

335
00:16:16,516 --> 00:16:20,987
AND IT'S STILL PRETTY HARD TO HEAR. RIGHT?

336
00:16:23,456 --> 00:16:25,458
THIS IS GOING TO SOUND SO SELFISH -

337
00:16:25,491 --> 00:16:27,226
AND INCREDIBLY LAME -

338
00:16:28,795 --> 00:16:31,497
BUT I HAD TO FIND MYSELF, ASH.

339
00:16:32,065 --> 00:16:34,701
EVEN IF IT MEANT HURTING YOU AND YOUR MOTHER.

340
00:16:34,734 --> 00:16:39,172
IT'S NOBODY'S FAULT. AND IT'S NOT WRONG.

341
00:16:39,205 --> 00:16:41,140
IT'S JUST THE WAY I AM.

342
00:16:42,608 --> 00:16:46,079
SO WHY DID YOU EVEN GET MARRIED? YOU DIDN'T LOVE MOM --

343
00:16:46,112 --> 00:16:49,082
ASH, OF COURSE I DID. I STILL DO.

344
00:16:49,115 --> 00:16:51,617
BUT, I'M NOT IN LOVE WITH HER.

345
00:16:53,286 --> 00:16:55,822
I TRIED TO MAKE IT WORK.

346
00:16:55,855 --> 00:16:58,124
BUT I JUST COULDN'T.

347
00:16:58,157 --> 00:17:00,793
AND I HATE MYSELF FOR HURTING YOU -

348
00:17:00,827 --> 00:17:04,564
BUT IT WAS THE ONLY THING I COULD DO. HONEST.

349
00:17:11,104 --> 00:17:13,072
I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT WORKED.

350
00:17:13,106 --> 00:17:16,609
NO - I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU USED THAT EXCUSE!

351
00:17:17,143 --> 00:17:21,214
OKAY, THERE SHE IS. IT'S TIME TO CEMENT THE DEAL.

352
00:17:21,614 --> 00:17:23,616
HEY, LIBERTY GIRLFRIEND.

353
00:17:37,697 --> 00:17:40,767
MAYBE YOU SHOULD TONE IT DOWN.

354
00:18:01,454 --> 00:18:04,123
HAVE YOU, YOU KNOW, BEEN WITH...

355
00:18:05,792 --> 00:18:07,593
OTHER MEN?

356
00:18:09,362 --> 00:18:12,698
BUT MOSTLY, JUST ONE MAN. CHRISTOPHER.

357
00:18:12,732 --> 00:18:13,566
CHRISTOPHER?

358
00:18:13,599 --> 00:18:16,836
MY PARTNER. HE'S A GREAT GUY -

359
00:18:16,869 --> 00:18:21,574
CHRISTOPHER. THE BLONDE GUY, WITH THE MOUSTACHE.

360
00:18:21,941 --> 00:18:23,709
THE GUY WE WENT TO THE ZOO WITH THAT DAY.

361
00:18:23,743 --> 00:18:26,746
WHEN I GOT THAT HORRIBLE SUNBURN -

362
00:18:26,779 --> 00:18:28,881
THE GUY YOU SAID WAS YOUR FRIEND FROM WORK.

363
00:18:28,915 --> 00:18:31,250
DAD - WE HAD HIM OVER FOR DINNER, IN OUR HOUSE--!

364
00:18:31,284 --> 00:18:31,684
HONEY -

365
00:18:33,719 --> 00:18:35,188
YOU LEFT US FOR HIM.

366
00:18:35,221 --> 00:18:37,490
ASH, IT'S NOT THAT SIMPLE -

367
00:18:38,191 --> 00:18:39,525
WE FELL IN LOVE.

368
00:18:40,293 --> 00:18:42,662
I'M SORRY BUT I JUST DON'T KNOW HOW ELSE TO SAY IT -

369
00:18:42,695 --> 00:18:43,162
NO.

370
00:18:44,297 --> 00:18:45,665
ASH -

371
00:18:45,698 --> 00:18:47,834
HOW COULD YOU DO THIS TO ME?

372
00:18:47,867 --> 00:18:49,635
YOU SEE THIS IS EXACTLY WHY I WANTED TO WAIT

373
00:18:49,669 --> 00:18:52,605
TILL YOU WERE OLDER. SO THAT YOU'D UNDERSTAND -

374
00:18:52,638 --> 00:18:53,706
UNDERSTAND?!

375
00:18:53,739 --> 00:18:55,808
YES. AND NOT JUST HATE ME.

376
00:18:55,842 --> 00:18:56,676
FOR WHAT, DAD? HUH?

377
00:18:56,709 --> 00:18:57,810
FOR KNOWING YOU WERE GAY?

378
00:18:57,844 --> 00:19:00,713
OR FOR KNOWING THAT ALL YOU'VE EVER DONE IS LIE TO ME?!

379
00:19:00,746 --> 00:19:01,414
ASHLEY?!

380
00:19:20,867 --> 00:19:23,603
LIBERTY. DIDN'T YOU HEAR WHAT I SAID EARLIER?

381
00:19:23,636 --> 00:19:25,438
LOUD AND CLEAR.

382
00:19:25,471 --> 00:19:27,907
AND THOUGH IT WAS A SHOCK, I SHOULD HAVE SEEN IT COMING.

383
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:31,744
DANCE LESSONS? AND THAT BOY BAND COMPILATION CD YOU OWN?

384
00:19:31,777 --> 00:19:33,546
THAT'S MY SISTER'S CD -!

385
00:19:33,579 --> 00:19:35,615
WHATEVER! SO, I WAS THINKING.

386
00:19:35,648 --> 00:19:37,450
WOULDN'T IT BE GREAT - I MEAN YOU CAN SAY NO -

387
00:19:37,483 --> 00:19:41,387
BUT WOULDN'T IT GREAT IF YOU CAME OUT IN THE GRAPEVINE?

388
00:19:41,420 --> 00:19:41,621
WHAT?

389
00:19:42,622 --> 00:19:43,456
WELL YOU KNOW.

390
00:19:43,489 --> 00:19:45,458
AS PART OF THE INTERVIEW.

391
00:19:45,491 --> 00:19:46,492
TO HELP ALL THE OTHER KIDS STRUGGLING

392
00:19:46,526 --> 00:19:48,628
WITH THIS SAME ISSUE.

393
00:19:48,661 --> 00:19:50,663
LIBERTY, I DON'T THINK THAT'S A VERY GOOD IDEA.

394
00:19:50,696 --> 00:19:52,298
J.T., IT'S NOTHING TO BE ASHAMED OF -

395
00:19:52,331 --> 00:19:54,667
LIBERTY, I'M NOT GAY, OKAY?!

396
00:19:58,304 --> 00:19:59,238
YOU LIED?

397
00:19:59,272 --> 00:20:02,008
YES, 'CAUSE - YOU JUST WOULDN'T TAKE A HINT.

398
00:20:02,041 --> 00:20:04,410
AM I REALLY THAT HORRIBLE?

399
00:20:05,511 --> 00:20:06,445
LIBERTY -

400
00:20:08,014 --> 00:20:12,552
IF YOU DIDN'T LIKE ME, YOU SHOULD HAVE JUST SAID SO.

401
00:20:21,694 --> 00:20:24,430
ASH! WHERE WERE YOU AFTER LUNCH?

402
00:20:24,463 --> 00:20:27,433
NOWHERE. JUST - LEAVE ME ALONE.

403
00:20:27,466 --> 00:20:29,869
ASH, C'MON. SOMETHING HAPPENED-

404
00:20:31,671 --> 00:20:33,472
YOU WANNA KNOW WHAT'S BEEN HAPPENING?

405
00:20:33,506 --> 00:20:35,808
MY DAD CAME HERE TO TELL ME THAT, NOT ONLY IS HE GAY?

406
00:20:35,841 --> 00:20:38,644
BUT HE DROPPED OUT OF MY LIFE BECAUSE OF HIS BOYFRIEND.

407
00:20:38,678 --> 00:20:39,845
IS THAT WHAT YOU WANTED TO HEAR?

408
00:20:39,879 --> 00:20:41,647
DOES THAT EXPLAIN ALL FOR YOU?

409
00:20:41,681 --> 00:20:42,982
ASH, COME ON -

410
00:20:43,015 --> 00:20:44,617
I'VE - COME TO A DECISION.

411
00:20:44,650 --> 00:20:48,287
MY DAD IS CUT OUT OF MY LIFE. FOR GOOD.

412
00:20:48,321 --> 00:20:49,655
ASH, COME ON -

413
00:20:49,689 --> 00:20:53,593
I HAVE MY MOM, I HAVE JEFF - I EVEN HAVE TOBY.

414
00:20:53,626 --> 00:20:55,361
I DON'T NEED HIM.

415
00:20:55,394 --> 00:20:57,597
ASH, WHAT YOU FOUND OUT - OF COURSE YOU'RE UPSET.

416
00:20:57,630 --> 00:20:59,365
BUT YOU DON'T MEAN THAT.

417
00:20:59,398 --> 00:21:01,033
DON'T TELL ME WHAT I MEAN, OKAY?

418
00:21:01,067 --> 00:21:04,604
YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT I'M GOING THROUGH?

419
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:08,808
MY MOM DIED, ASH.

420
00:21:08,841 --> 00:21:10,977
SHE'S NEVER COMING BACK.

421
00:21:11,010 --> 00:21:13,679
BUT YOU? YOU HAVE YOUR DAD BACK.

422
00:21:14,513 --> 00:21:15,915
TERRI IT'S NOT THE SAME -

423
00:21:15,948 --> 00:21:17,683
NO, IT'S NOT THE SAME.

424
00:21:17,717 --> 00:21:19,518
AND YOU WANNA KNOW WHY?

425
00:21:19,552 --> 00:21:22,388
'CAUSE YOU HAVE A CHOICE. I DON'T.

426
00:21:22,955 --> 00:21:25,324
DON'T MAKE THE WRONG ONE.
