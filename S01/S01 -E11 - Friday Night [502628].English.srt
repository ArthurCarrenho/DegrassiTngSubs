1
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:09,450
It's called "Passion Flame".

2
00:00:09,483 --> 00:00:11,518
Ooh! Very hot...

3
00:00:11,552 --> 00:00:13,721
Speaking of hot...

4
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:21,095
Hey.

5
00:00:21,128 --> 00:00:22,229
Hey.

6
00:00:22,262 --> 00:00:27,701
Oh. uh, gee, I forgot. I have to go talk to Liberty...

7
00:00:27,735 --> 00:00:29,303
So, you do that math assignment?

8
00:00:29,336 --> 00:00:30,371
Yeah, it was brutal.

9
00:00:30,404 --> 00:00:33,374
Yeah, yeah it was. So, it's Friday.

10
00:00:35,509 --> 00:00:36,510
Yup.

11
00:00:37,444 --> 00:00:40,080
Do you- do you have any plans?

12
00:00:40,114 --> 00:00:40,914
No.

13
00:00:41,715 --> 00:00:44,785
Okay, well- maybe we could hang out.

14
00:00:47,287 --> 00:00:48,288
Sure.

15
00:00:49,556 --> 00:00:52,292
Alright. cool. well, I'll see ya.

16
00:00:55,896 --> 00:00:58,832
Okay, so? What did he want?

17
00:00:59,299 --> 00:01:04,638
Manny, I'm not sure, but - I think he asked me on a date!

18
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:07,141
Eeeee!!

20
00:01:12,679 --> 00:01:15,516

It's just so exciting. your first date!

30
00:01:51,919 --> 00:01:52,786
I know!

31
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:56,156
And romantic. so - how did he ask you?

32
00:01:56,190 --> 00:01:57,724
I don't know - he just asked me.

33
00:01:57,758 --> 00:02:00,828
Well, it had to more than just "oh, he asked me".

34
00:02:01,462 --> 00:02:02,930
Hey, guys.

35
00:02:02,963 --> 00:02:05,232
I mean, girls.

36
00:02:05,265 --> 00:02:07,701
I mean--

37
00:02:08,202 --> 00:02:09,736
Let's go sharpen our pencils...

38
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:11,872
Great idea.

39
00:02:15,876 --> 00:02:19,313
Why can't Toby just -- I don't know -- like you instead of me?

40
00:02:19,346 --> 00:02:21,248
Forget about him, and give me details.

41
00:02:21,281 --> 00:02:22,850
Exactly what Sean said.

42
00:02:22,883 --> 00:02:24,084
Okay -

43
00:02:24,117 --> 00:02:26,386
well, first we talked about that horrible math assignment

44
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:28,856
and then he mentioned that it's Friday-

45
00:02:28,889 --> 00:02:31,291
I know, kind of weird.

46
00:02:31,325 --> 00:02:33,560
And then he said, "maybe we could hang out."

47
00:02:33,694 --> 00:02:35,395
Okay. and?

48
00:02:35,429 --> 00:02:39,199
Nothing. just - hang. out.

49
00:02:39,433 --> 00:02:41,568
Oh.

50
00:02:41,602 --> 00:02:42,970
This is a date, right?

51
00:02:43,003 --> 00:02:45,906
Of course. I think ...

52
00:02:51,378 --> 00:02:53,547
These are permission forms for next week's bus trip

53
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:56,483
to Stratford, to see "Romeo and Juliet".

54
00:02:56,517 --> 00:02:58,952
[tapping]

55
00:02:59,052 --> 00:03:01,388
Sorry - could whoever's making that noise-

56
00:03:01,421 --> 00:03:05,726
please cease and desist. That means, stop.

57
00:03:09,329 --> 00:03:13,734
Have a parent or guardian sign the form and enclose a cheque--

58
00:03:13,767 --> 00:03:16,837
[tapping]

59
00:03:17,271 --> 00:03:19,439
Alright. who's doing that?

60
00:03:30,984 --> 00:03:33,820
Detention. after school.

61
00:03:33,954 --> 00:03:36,523
What?? But --

62
00:03:36,557 --> 00:03:38,525
Hey, you can't--

63
00:03:39,359 --> 00:03:40,460
My discman -!

64
00:03:40,494 --> 00:03:44,231
No, your fault. for listening to it in my homeroom.

65
00:03:44,631 --> 00:03:47,901
Keep wasting my time, Gavin? And I'll keep wasting yours.

66
00:03:54,575 --> 00:03:56,643
I'm sure he was asking you out.

67
00:03:56,677 --> 00:03:59,913
Well, I'm not so sure any more. And besides even if he was -

68
00:03:59,947 --> 00:04:03,050
couldn't he have been a bit more romantic?

69
00:04:03,083 --> 00:04:05,552
Here's your chance to find out.

70
00:04:09,957 --> 00:04:13,794
Sean -- about tonight --

71
00:04:14,795 --> 00:04:16,530
Yuh.

72
00:04:18,966 --> 00:04:22,469
Yuh?! Sean -

73
00:04:22,636 --> 00:04:25,572
Okay, today we're gonna play some dodgeball.

74
00:04:36,984 --> 00:04:39,519
Good arm, Emma.

75
00:04:45,726 --> 00:04:49,896
Again, nice shot - but there are other targets, you know...

76
00:04:55,936 --> 00:04:57,838
Grade eight students interested in the Stratford trip

77
00:04:57,871 --> 00:05:00,073
are reminded to talk to your parents this weekend

78
00:05:00,107 --> 00:05:02,943
and return your forms to Ms. Kwan.

79
00:05:04,111 --> 00:05:05,979
Ms. Kwan is such a tyrant.

80
00:05:06,013 --> 00:05:08,749
Come on, Jimmy. Spinner let earwigs loose in the caf.

81
00:05:08,782 --> 00:05:10,617
Kwan had to do something.

82
00:05:10,651 --> 00:05:12,919
So, who are you sitting with on the bus to Stratford?

83
00:05:12,953 --> 00:05:15,422
My Juliet... of course.

84
00:05:18,792 --> 00:05:22,362
Ms. Kerwin, Mr. Brooks. this is a school, not a petting zoo.

85
00:05:22,396 --> 00:05:24,097
Kindly disengage yourselves.

86
00:05:24,131 --> 00:05:25,165
But -- we were just --

87
00:05:25,198 --> 00:05:27,401
would you prefer to take it up with the principal?

88
00:05:27,434 --> 00:05:28,935
I'm sure he'd be happy to discuss the finer points

89
00:05:28,969 --> 00:05:31,972
of the Degrassi code of conduct.

90
00:05:34,975 --> 00:05:36,843
You two may think you're adorable,

91
00:05:36,877 --> 00:05:39,680
but that doesn't mean anyone else does...

92
00:05:40,414 --> 00:05:42,516
Total tyrant ...

93
00:05:44,017 --> 00:05:46,386
Here you go. One lamb stroganoff.

94
00:05:47,754 --> 00:05:50,390
Kwan did it to you, too? Man, she has made it

95
00:05:50,424 --> 00:05:52,959
her mission to make our lives miserable.

96
00:05:52,993 --> 00:05:55,095
I wouldn't be working here if it wasn't for her!

97
00:05:55,128 --> 00:05:56,163
No, you wouldn't be working here

98
00:05:56,196 --> 00:05:59,666
if you wouldn't have dumped bugs in Ash's food.

99
00:05:59,833 --> 00:06:01,868
A minor detail.

100
00:06:02,135 --> 00:06:06,473
Jimmy. You and I should join forces. Get Kwan back.

101
00:06:07,441 --> 00:06:09,876
Teach her a lesson.

102
00:06:10,077 --> 00:06:12,412
No way, man. we try to get revenge?

103
00:06:12,446 --> 00:06:14,715
I'll wind up wearing a hairnet, too.

104
00:06:16,583 --> 00:06:19,953
Hey princess. Less talk, more work.

105
00:06:26,793 --> 00:06:28,762
Manny, I have no idea what to do.

106
00:06:28,795 --> 00:06:31,031
Toby says Sean was just making conversation.

107
00:06:31,064 --> 00:06:32,733
You asked Toby about Sean?

108
00:06:32,766 --> 00:06:34,701
I know, but I'm desperate here!

109
00:06:34,735 --> 00:06:37,070
Having a little boy trouble, Emma?

110
00:06:37,104 --> 00:06:38,905
Anything I can help you with?

111
00:06:38,939 --> 00:06:40,707
No. Nothing's going on.

112
00:06:40,741 --> 00:06:42,442
Hon - your thing for Sean is more obvious

113
00:06:42,476 --> 00:06:44,711
than Heather Sinclair's bargain-basement nose job.

114
00:06:44,745 --> 00:06:47,147
Do you want my advice, or not?

115
00:06:47,881 --> 00:06:50,684
Okay. Sean asked me to "hang out" with him tonight.

116
00:06:50,717 --> 00:06:53,553
Not "go out," "hang out".

117
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:56,089
I thought he might be asking me on a date. I was wrong?

118
00:06:56,123 --> 00:06:57,491
Hon, that's a date.

119
00:06:57,524 --> 00:06:58,658
Told you --

120
00:06:58,692 --> 00:07:02,662
Just in guy speak. Vague. Short. "Yes." "No." "Grunt."

121
00:07:02,696 --> 00:07:03,964
"Yuh"?

122
00:07:03,997 --> 00:07:05,832
"Yuh" definitely qualifies.

123
00:07:05,866 --> 00:07:07,868
Em, it's Sean we're talking about.

124
00:07:07,901 --> 00:07:10,704
He's a one-syllable kinda guy.

125
00:07:15,075 --> 00:07:16,743
Kwan 's in a meeting with Raditch.

126
00:07:16,777 --> 00:07:18,879
She says to review Romeo and Juliet to get ready

127
00:07:18,912 --> 00:07:21,448
for our field trip. She'll be back soon.

128
00:07:31,191 --> 00:07:32,926
Okay class, listen up.

129
00:07:32,959 --> 00:07:37,063
Shakespeare is the greatest writer, not just of his time,

130
00:07:37,097 --> 00:07:38,532
but of all time.

131
00:07:38,565 --> 00:07:41,168
But Ms. Kwan, if he's such a great writer,

132
00:07:41,201 --> 00:07:44,671
why is reading him such a big yawn?

133
00:07:44,704 --> 00:07:47,941
Because you are a moron!

134
00:07:48,775 --> 00:07:49,976
But Ms. Kwan -!

135
00:07:50,010 --> 00:07:53,513
And for being a moron, I punish you with a week's detention!

136
00:07:53,747 --> 00:07:55,982
A week's detention?!

137
00:07:56,016 --> 00:07:58,919
If you want to waste my time, I'll waste yours!

138
00:08:04,324 --> 00:08:07,828
Sorry I'm late. I know you're all anxious to begin.

139
00:08:07,861 --> 00:08:12,065
Shakespeare is the greatest writer, not just of his time,

140
00:08:12,098 --> 00:08:14,901
but of all time.

141
00:08:14,935 --> 00:08:20,207
Even though some of you may find reading him a "big yawn".

142
00:08:22,642 --> 00:08:25,212
Mr. Brooks, did you know that Mr. Raditch's office

143
00:08:25,245 --> 00:08:27,581
has a direct link to this classroom?

144
00:08:27,614 --> 00:08:30,116
When you turn the intercom on, you can hear

145
00:08:30,150 --> 00:08:33,253
every single word that's spoken in here.

146
00:08:34,054 --> 00:08:36,957
Mr. Brooks? Gavin already has a detention tonight.

147
00:08:36,990 --> 00:08:39,125
You can keep him company.

148
00:09:16,997 --> 00:09:20,267
Maybe because you tried to kill me in dodgeball.

149
00:09:22,869 --> 00:09:24,137
So - you don't hate me?

150
00:09:24,170 --> 00:09:26,306
Of course not.

151
00:09:27,274 --> 00:09:28,742
So we're still on for tonight?

152
00:09:28,775 --> 00:09:31,111
Absolutely. if - you want to...

153
00:09:31,978 --> 00:09:35,148
Oh, I want to. I'll pick you up at seven at your place.

154
00:09:35,181 --> 00:09:37,651
Great. see you then.

155
00:09:52,799 --> 00:09:57,871
It's Friday afternoon and we're stuck here. This is so unfair.

156
00:09:59,105 --> 00:10:01,908
Now do you think something should be done?

157
00:10:02,108 --> 00:10:04,010
Guys - I'm teaching a night school course

158
00:10:04,044 --> 00:10:08,148
in three more hours. You don't want to join me, do you?

159
00:10:19,726 --> 00:10:22,896
[coughing]

160
00:10:46,886 --> 00:10:48,154
Okay. So, which shirt do you like better?

161
00:10:48,188 --> 00:10:49,923
This one or the one I'm wearing?

162
00:10:49,956 --> 00:10:52,392
Both are great.

163
00:10:55,829 --> 00:11:00,300
So... your first date. I remember my first date.

164
00:11:00,333 --> 00:11:03,069
Let me guess. You're going to tell me all about it.

165
00:11:03,103 --> 00:11:07,173
It was awful. I was so nervous! I kept laughing like a hyena

166
00:11:07,207 --> 00:11:11,144
and I had the worst case of verbal diarrhea --

167
00:11:11,311 --> 00:11:13,046
Sorry. This isn't helping, is it?

168
00:11:13,079 --> 00:11:14,247
[knock at door]

169
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:16,216
I'll get it!

170
00:11:18,251 --> 00:11:20,120
Sean, hi.

171
00:11:20,153 --> 00:11:22,255
Hi, Christine.

172
00:11:24,057 --> 00:11:27,727
Emma, your date's here.

173
00:11:28,795 --> 00:11:29,963
Hi.

174
00:11:30,063 --> 00:11:31,464
Hi.

175
00:11:31,498 --> 00:11:34,768
You kids have a good time. And be home by ten --

176
00:11:37,537 --> 00:11:41,041
Wait! I almost forgot.

177
00:11:42,175 --> 00:11:43,343
Mo-om!

178
00:11:43,376 --> 00:11:45,845
Just one photo, that's all.

179
00:11:45,945 --> 00:11:49,382
Sean? Take one giant step towards Emma...

180
00:11:51,551 --> 00:11:54,421
And...cheese!

181
00:11:57,524 --> 00:11:58,925
Sorry about my mom.

182
00:11:58,958 --> 00:11:59,926
No problem.

183
00:11:59,959 --> 00:12:01,161
So what do you want to do?

184
00:12:01,194 --> 00:12:02,295
Well, we could -

185
00:12:02,328 --> 00:12:03,396
I was thinking we could go see a movie

186
00:12:03,430 --> 00:12:05,498
Or we could grab a bite. Or we could go to Playdium.

187
00:12:05,532 --> 00:12:07,067
Or there's this free concert in the park --

188
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:08,935
Relax, okay?

189
00:12:08,968 --> 00:12:11,971
Whatever we do tonight we're gonna have fun.

190
00:12:12,472 --> 00:12:16,476
Right. oh, god, that was verbal diarrhea, wasn't it --?

191
00:13:01,321 --> 00:13:06,059
This test focuses on English verb tenses.

192
00:13:06,092 --> 00:13:09,462
"You will write the test. You write the test."

193
00:13:09,496 --> 00:13:11,498
And in an hour you'll be able to say,

194
00:13:11,531 --> 00:13:15,068
"You wrote the test ..." Please begin.

195
00:13:19,606 --> 00:13:22,976
[chewing loudly]

196
00:13:24,410 --> 00:13:27,113
Excuse me, but whoever is chewing gum

197
00:13:27,147 --> 00:13:29,616
please spit it out immediately?

198
00:13:29,649 --> 00:13:32,185
It's disturbing the rest of the class.

199
00:13:42,629 --> 00:13:45,965
I'll be right back.

200
00:13:50,370 --> 00:13:52,872
Is anyone in there?

201
00:13:53,239 --> 00:13:56,142
Lou, have you - seen anyone hanging around?

202
00:13:56,543 --> 00:13:58,111
Do you mind opening this door for me?

203
00:13:58,144 --> 00:14:00,480
Ok.

204
00:14:26,172 --> 00:14:28,241
Time for part two.

205
00:14:33,947 --> 00:14:36,349
Hi - I'd like to make an order, please?

206
00:14:41,487 --> 00:14:42,589
You didn't have to buy me dinner.

207
00:14:42,622 --> 00:14:45,024
Please. After going back to my house so I could change,

208
00:14:45,058 --> 00:14:47,594
and having my mom take another picture of us?

209
00:14:47,627 --> 00:14:49,362
It was the least I could do.

210
00:14:49,395 --> 00:14:51,264
Oh well - okay. I'll get the movie.

211
00:14:51,297 --> 00:14:54,934
Deal. I got you a veggie burger... I hope that's okay.

212
00:14:54,968 --> 00:14:57,937
Yeah, it's fine. As long as it's not a hamburger.

213
00:14:57,971 --> 00:14:59,939
You're a vegetarian too?

214
00:14:59,973 --> 00:15:02,408
Actually, I love meat.

215
00:15:02,442 --> 00:15:04,677
But last summer, I spent a month with my aunt and uncle

216
00:15:04,711 --> 00:15:07,981
on their farm? They raise cattle for harvest.

217
00:15:08,014 --> 00:15:09,716
Harvest?

218
00:15:09,749 --> 00:15:12,952
Yeah, it's a more polite way of saying "slaughter."

219
00:15:12,986 --> 00:15:15,555
Anyway, I saw a couple of these cows get "harvested".

220
00:15:15,588 --> 00:15:20,293
It was awful. The sounds - and the blood and guts,

221
00:15:20,326 --> 00:15:24,464
oozing all over the place. And the smell, it was just --

222
00:15:25,298 --> 00:15:27,233
Sorry. I really didn't mean to-

223
00:15:27,267 --> 00:15:30,470
No. it's okay. really.

224
00:15:30,703 --> 00:15:33,706
Anyways, I figured if I couldn't handle

225
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:35,541
Watching them become meat?

226
00:15:35,575 --> 00:15:37,477
Then I couldn't eat meat, either.

227
00:15:37,510 --> 00:15:40,613
It's a good way of looking at it.

228
00:15:40,647 --> 00:15:43,683
I mean - so many people are hypocrites that way --

229
00:15:43,716 --> 00:15:46,085
They just pick up their meat from the supermarket

230
00:15:46,119 --> 00:15:48,421
in the nice shiny packages and don't even think about

231
00:15:48,454 --> 00:15:50,590
what happened to it before it got there.

232
00:15:50,623 --> 00:15:53,359
You've got this blob on your chin.

233
00:15:58,331 --> 00:16:03,670
[knock on door]

234
00:16:07,206 --> 00:16:10,143
Yeah, twelve dozen honey garlic wings here.

235
00:16:10,176 --> 00:16:12,278
But -- I didn't order anything.

236
00:16:12,312 --> 00:16:14,781
Is the number here 555-1950?

237
00:16:14,814 --> 00:16:16,115
Yes --

238
00:16:16,149 --> 00:16:17,283
And you're -- Ms. Kwan?

239
00:16:17,317 --> 00:16:18,584
Yes, but --

240
00:16:18,618 --> 00:16:20,119
Then you ordered this.

241
00:16:20,153 --> 00:16:22,689
That'll be fifty-three forty eight, please.

242
00:16:22,722 --> 00:16:25,491
There is no way that I am paying that!

243
00:16:25,625 --> 00:16:31,564
Ms. Kwan, I help pay, I have hunger.

244
00:16:32,665 --> 00:16:35,034
I am hungry, Akesh ...

245
00:16:35,134 --> 00:16:36,169
Okay.

246
00:16:38,538 --> 00:16:41,207
I am hungry, too, Ms. Kwan.

247
00:16:41,607 --> 00:16:43,710
Are you hungry, man? You got money?

248
00:16:48,715 --> 00:16:50,817
Hey, Ms. Kwan.

249
00:16:50,850 --> 00:16:53,519
I will eat the chicken wing.

250
00:16:56,422 --> 00:16:59,158
I eat the chicken wing.

251
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:02,095
I ate the chicken wing!

252
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:08,601
My wallet.

253
00:17:10,203 --> 00:17:12,372
I'm paying for the movie, remember?

254
00:17:12,405 --> 00:17:15,274
No, it's not that. My wallet was on the tray

255
00:17:15,308 --> 00:17:17,443
and then we threw out our stuff-

256
00:17:17,477 --> 00:17:18,811
You threw out your wallet?

257
00:17:18,845 --> 00:17:21,381
I don't know. I think so -!

258
00:17:39,699 --> 00:17:41,701
I think I got it -

259
00:17:44,303 --> 00:17:46,239
Ugh!

260
00:17:50,710 --> 00:17:54,814
Hi. She lost her wallet.

261
00:17:56,349 --> 00:17:57,717
I guess you'd kinda like us to do this

262
00:17:57,750 --> 00:18:00,520
someplace else, huh?

263
00:18:01,621 --> 00:18:03,222
This is for making me spend every lunch hour

264
00:18:03,256 --> 00:18:05,158
in the cafeteria.

265
00:18:05,324 --> 00:18:08,494
And this is for making me wear a hairnet in public.

266
00:18:09,862 --> 00:18:11,697
C'mon, Jimmy. Fire away.

267
00:18:11,831 --> 00:18:12,832
I don't think so -

268
00:18:12,865 --> 00:18:14,867
You don't know what you're missing.

269
00:18:16,269 --> 00:18:19,405
And this is for making me read Shakespeare in public.

270
00:18:19,572 --> 00:18:22,208
And this is for making me and Ashley feel like dirt.

271
00:18:39,692 --> 00:18:43,229
[crying]

272
00:18:51,971 --> 00:18:53,773
It's not here.

273
00:18:53,806 --> 00:18:56,909
Someone must have stolen it.

274
00:18:58,644 --> 00:19:00,546
You're sure you left it on your tray?

275
00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:02,682
Of course I'm sure. I bought the meal,

276
00:19:02,715 --> 00:19:03,916
set my wallet on the tray -

277
00:19:03,950 --> 00:19:06,452
then you almost spilled ketchup on it while we were eating -

278
00:19:06,486 --> 00:19:08,321
and then I --

279
00:19:11,591 --> 00:19:13,626
Oh, no.

280
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:19,665
Oh, no! Um, it's here.

281
00:19:33,012 --> 00:19:36,782
So... this is pre-poop and this is post-poop?

282
00:19:37,383 --> 00:19:39,685
I like your first outfit better.

283
00:19:41,654 --> 00:19:44,790
I'll be lucky if Sean ever speaks to me again.

284
00:19:44,824 --> 00:19:46,692
Emma. If Sean really likes you-

285
00:19:46,726 --> 00:19:48,794
He's not going to let some bird crap, rotting garbage

286
00:19:48,828 --> 00:19:50,363
and a couple of embarrassing pictures

287
00:19:50,396 --> 00:19:53,399
change his mind. Really.

288
00:20:02,408 --> 00:20:03,910
So. How's your wallet?

289
00:20:03,943 --> 00:20:07,647
Sean, I'm so, so, so sorry about Friday night.

290
00:20:12,718 --> 00:20:15,788
Can I have this?

291
00:20:18,858 --> 00:20:20,893
It's all yours.

292
00:20:20,927 --> 00:20:23,429
Thanks.

293
00:20:30,036 --> 00:20:32,338
You shoulda seen the look on her face.

294
00:20:32,371 --> 00:20:34,640
I wish I had a video camera!

295
00:20:36,776 --> 00:20:38,878
It was pretty funny.

296
00:20:38,911 --> 00:20:41,781
Sounds sorta cruel to me.

297
00:20:43,082 --> 00:20:46,652
Look, whatever. Kwan asked for it, and Kwan got it.

298
00:20:46,686 --> 00:20:48,921
Big time.

299
00:20:51,891 --> 00:20:54,393
Good morning, everyone.

300
00:20:54,427 --> 00:20:56,529
Ms. Kwan - will not be here today.

301
00:20:56,562 --> 00:20:58,598
Or for the rest of the term.

302
00:20:58,631 --> 00:21:01,367
She's requested a leave of absence. Which I've granted.

303
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:04,704
So, I'll be filling in for her.

304
00:21:04,737 --> 00:21:06,505
Unfortunately, this means that we'll be canceling

305
00:21:06,539 --> 00:21:08,774
your trip to Stratford.

306
00:21:10,376 --> 00:21:13,346
Ms. Kwan wanted me to apologize to you for that.

307
00:21:15,014 --> 00:21:16,949
Is Ms. Kwan gonna be okay?

308
00:21:16,983 --> 00:21:19,619
Well - she's been under a lot of pressure lately.

309
00:21:19,652 --> 00:21:22,588
Her husband is very ill. The stress of that -

310
00:21:22,622 --> 00:21:25,391
plus working full-time - overtime, really -

311
00:21:25,424 --> 00:21:27,693
was just too much for her.

312
00:21:27,727 --> 00:21:29,996
Right. open your text books...

313
00:21:30,029 --> 00:21:32,031
And your malleable little minds.
