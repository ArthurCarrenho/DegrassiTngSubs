WITH NO ONE TO LISTEN.

355
00:15:07,324 --> 00:15:08,242
LET'S GO.

356
00:15:08,325 --> 00:15:09,243
CHANTAY:
WHAT'RE YOU WEARING?

357
00:15:09,326 --> 00:15:10,369
DO YOU GET TO KEEP
YOUR CLOTHES?

358
00:15:10,452 --> 00:15:12,120
ANYA:
DO YOU GET TO SPEND
MORE TIME WITH TOM?

359
00:15:17,084 --> 00:15:19,545
P.A. ANNOUNCEMENT:
ATTENTION, STUDENTS.
A BRIEF REMINDER...

360
00:15:19,628 --> 00:15:21,505
CONNOR:
UM, AREN'T WE GOING
TO THE CAFETERIA?

361
00:15:21,588 --> 00:15:23,382
WE USUALLY EAT
IN THE CAFETERIA.

362
00:15:23,465 --> 00:15:25,717
CLARE:
I THOUGHT WE'D TRY SOME PLACE
DIFFERENT, TODAY.

363
00:15:25,801 --> 00:15:27,803
NICE PIPES YESTERDAY,
LITTLE EDWARDS.

364
00:15:27,886 --> 00:15:28,887
BETWEEN THE VOICE
AND THE OUTFIT?

365
00:15:28,971 --> 00:15:29,805
YOU COULD BE ON IDOL.

366
00:15:29,888 --> 00:15:31,723
THE BLOOPER REEL,
AT LEAST.

367
00:15:31,807 --> 00:15:33,976
I THINK WE SHOULD EAT
IN THE CAFETERIA.

368
00:15:34,059 --> 00:15:35,143
CLARE:
UH, HEY, CONNOR?

369
00:15:35,227 --> 00:15:37,729
UH, IS THERE ANY WAY TO MAKE
FIREWORKS BRIGHTER?

370
00:15:37,813 --> 00:15:38,730
CONNOR:
WELL, YOU MAKE THEM BRIGHTER

371
00:15:38,814 --> 00:15:40,399
BY ADDING COMPOUNDS
WITH MORE OXYGEN

372
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:42,693
AND...

373
00:15:42,776 --> 00:15:44,736
YOU'RE IN MY SEAT.

374
00:15:45,737 --> 00:15:47,531
SORRY.
HEH.

375
00:15:47,614 --> 00:15:49,992
SO, UM, HOW DO YOU MAKE
OTHER EFFECTS?

376
00:15:50,075 --> 00:15:51,743
CONNOR:
BY MIXING OTHER ADDITIVES:

377
00:15:51,827 --> 00:15:53,412
TITANIUM MAKES SPARKS;

378
00:15:53,495 --> 00:15:54,663
ZINC MAKES SMOKE CLOUDS;

379
00:15:54,746 --> 00:15:56,415
CALCIUM DEEPENS COLOUR.

380
00:15:56,498 --> 00:15:57,416
YOU CAN TRACE AMOUNTS OF METALS

381
00:15:57,499 --> 00:15:59,251
THAT BURN AT HIGH TEMPERATURES
TO MAKE...

382
00:15:59,334 --> 00:16:00,502
DANNY:
LEIA.

383
00:16:00,586 --> 00:16:01,753
YOU'VE GOTTA HELP ME OUT.

384
00:16:01,837 --> 00:16:03,589
MIA'S PLAYING ME HOT
AND COLD.

385
00:16:03,672 --> 00:16:05,757
DO I HAVE A CHANCE?
WHAT'S HER GAME?

386
00:16:05,841 --> 00:16:07,718
YOU DON'T WANT
TO KNOW.

387
00:16:07,801 --> 00:16:09,178
BUT YOU'RE FRIENDS,
RIGHT?

388
00:16:09,261 --> 00:16:11,013
WERE FRIENDS.

389
00:16:11,096 --> 00:16:13,015
AND THE CAUSE OF THE SUDDEN
BREAK UP?

390
00:16:13,098 --> 00:16:16,351
LET'S JUST SAY MIA'S
MORE ADVENTUROUS THAN I AM.

391
00:16:16,435 --> 00:16:18,353
ADVENTUROUS, HOW?

392
00:16:22,232 --> 00:16:24,776
SHE SLEPT WITH TOM BLAKE
TO GET THE JOB.

393
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:26,820
SO DO YOU HAVE
A CHANCE?

394
00:16:26,904 --> 00:16:28,238
MAYBE.

395
00:16:28,322 --> 00:16:29,823
DO YOU WANT IT?

396
00:16:29,907 --> 00:16:31,867
THAT'S UP TO YOU.

397
00:16:38,248 --> 00:16:40,042
MOORE'S LAW SAYS
THAT COMPUTING POWER DOUBLES

398
00:16:40,125 --> 00:16:41,043
EVERY 18 MONTHS.

399
00:16:41,126 --> 00:16:43,420
SO, WHERE WILL WE BE
IN TEN YEARS?

400
00:16:43,504 --> 00:16:44,296
(KNOCK ON THE DOOR)

401
00:16:44,379 --> 00:16:45,422
SHEPPARD:
HOWDY PARDNER.

402
00:16:45,506 --> 00:16:48,383
NEED A WORD
WITH YOUR SPECIAL CLASS.

403
00:16:48,467 --> 00:16:49,635
HI.

404
00:16:49,718 --> 00:16:51,345
SOME OF YOU HAVE BEEN
EATING IN HERE.

405
00:16:51,428 --> 00:16:53,972
NOW, THESE COMPUTERS
ARE EXPENSIVE

406
00:16:54,056 --> 00:16:55,599
AND THEY DON'T LIKE MAYO.

407
00:16:55,682 --> 00:17:00,020
SO PLEASE EAT ONLY IN
DESIGNATED LUNCH AREAS.

408
00:17:00,771 --> 00:17:02,773
I SUGGEST THE CAF.
WITH ME?

409
00:17:04,107 --> 00:17:05,108
OOH.

410
00:17:06,109 --> 00:17:07,027
THAT'S IT.

411
00:17:07,110 --> 00:17:09,363
'CAUSE IT'S GOT SUCH
GREAT ENTERTAINMENT.

412
00:17:09,446 --> 00:17:10,489
HUH, CLARE?

413
00:17:10,572 --> 00:17:11,907
CLASS:
(LAUGHS)

414
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:13,659
SIMPSON:
UM...

415
00:17:13,742 --> 00:17:14,993
GUYS, SETTLE DOWN.
ALL RIGHT, SETTLE DOWN.

416
00:17:15,077 --> 00:17:16,870
UM... WHERE WERE WE?

417
00:17:16,954 --> 00:17:19,248
UM, LET'S KEEP OUR MIND
ON THE CLASS, ALL RIGHT?

418
00:17:23,043 --> 00:17:24,336
CLARE.

419
00:17:24,419 --> 00:17:27,005
WHAT, DIDN'T GET YOUR DIGS
IN CLASS?

420
00:17:27,089 --> 00:17:28,924
ALLI WAS JOKING.

421
00:17:29,007 --> 00:17:30,133
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

422
00:17:30,217 --> 00:17:33,095
I WAS UNTIL YOU HAD ME
MAKE A FOOL OF MYSELF.

423
00:17:33,178 --> 00:17:34,596
I'M SORRY.

424
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:36,682
I WAS JUST TRYING TO PROVE
YOU CARE WHAT PEOPLE THINK.

425
00:17:36,765 --> 00:17:37,683
MISSION ACCOMPLISHED.

426
00:17:37,766 --> 00:17:39,977
NOW I KNOW THEY THINK
I'M A DORK.

427
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:42,104
KC:
SO NOW IT'S BACK TO HANGING
ONLY WITH THE SMART KIDS?

428
00:17:45,649 --> 00:17:48,819
STUDENTS:
(HUM OF OVERLAPPING CHATTER)

429
00:17:51,613 --> 00:17:53,365
THEY GET ME,
OKAY?

430
00:17:53,448 --> 00:17:54,950
THEY DON'T THINK
I'M WEIRD

431
00:17:55,033 --> 00:17:56,910
OR... LAUGH AT ME.

432
00:17:57,911 --> 00:18:01,081
SO IT'S NOT THAT YOU
DON'T CARE WHAT PEOPLE THINK?

433
00:18:01,164 --> 00:18:02,875
MY SISTER DARCY
IS THE PRETTY

434
00:18:02,958 --> 00:18:04,710
AND POPULAR ONE.

435
00:18:04,793 --> 00:18:07,963
I'M GOOD AT BEING
THE SMART ONE.

436
00:18:10,132 --> 00:18:14,052
YOU'RE SO MUCH MORE
THAN "THE SMART ONE."

437
00:18:21,351 --> 00:18:24,688
JANICE:
A MOMENT WITH MY CLIENT, ANDRE.

438
00:18:24,771 --> 00:18:25,689
YOUR FIRST SHOOT

439
00:18:25,772 --> 00:18:27,316
AND YOU CAN BARELY
KEEP YOUR EYES OPEN?

440
00:18:27,399 --> 00:18:28,025
I... (SIGHS)

441
00:18:28,108 --> 00:18:29,735
WAS I WRONG TO TAKE
A CHANCE ON YOU?

442
00:18:29,818 --> 00:18:30,944
I WAS OUT LATE.

443
00:18:31,028 --> 00:18:32,112
WHEN YOU SHOULD HAVE BEEN
AT HOME RESTING

444
00:18:32,196 --> 00:18:34,031
FOR THE BIG DAY.

445
00:18:34,573 --> 00:18:36,700
BUT I THOUGHT THE SOCIAL STUFF
HELPED GET WORK?

446
00:18:36,783 --> 00:18:38,076
SAYS WHO?

447
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:40,078
IT WAS CLEAR FROM THE MOMENT
YOU LEFT THE STUDIO

448
00:18:40,162 --> 00:18:41,079
YOU WERE FIRST CHOICE;

449
00:18:41,163 --> 00:18:42,247
IT WAS UNANIMOUS.

450
00:18:42,331 --> 00:18:43,248
IT WAS? BUT...

451
00:18:43,332 --> 00:18:45,751
YOU KNEW THAT DAY?
BUT TOM, HE-

452
00:18:45,834 --> 00:18:48,378
YOU'RE NOT GETTING INFATUATED
WITH TOM, ARE YOU?

453
00:18:48,462 --> 00:18:50,380
HIS WIFE
WOULD NOT APPROVE.

454
00:18:50,464 --> 00:18:52,049
WIFE?
HE'S MARRIED?

455
00:18:52,132 --> 00:18:54,593
TWO YEARS.
NOW, SMARTEN UP.

456
00:18:54,676 --> 00:18:56,053
THE ONLY SCENE
THAT COUNTS WITH ME

457
00:18:56,136 --> 00:18:58,096
IS THE ONE WE'RE SHOOTING
RIGHT NOW.

458

00:19:08,565 --> 00:19:10,776

THAT I ALREADY HAD THE JOB.
