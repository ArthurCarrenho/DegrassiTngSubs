356
00:16:07,718 --> 00:16:09,136
UM, WHERE'S CARLO?

357
00:16:09,219 --> 00:16:10,304
YOUR BRO HAD A GREAT GAME.

358
00:16:10,387 --> 00:16:12,097
BIG STRONG LEGS.

359
00:16:12,181 --> 00:16:15,225
GUESS IT'S THAT VALIERI
FOOTBALL GENE, HUH?

360
00:16:15,309 --> 00:16:17,811
MY LAST NAME IS VAUGHAN.
I CHANGED IT.

361
00:16:17,895 --> 00:16:20,480
DO YOU GUYS KNOW
WHERE MY MOM AND DAD ARE?

362
00:16:20,564 --> 00:16:21,940
LUCAS, STOP IT.

363
00:16:22,024 --> 00:16:22,983
WHY DO YOU NEED DAD?

364
00:16:23,066 --> 00:16:24,318
I NEED TO TALK TO HIM
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED

365
00:16:24,401 --> 00:16:25,319
WHEN WE WERE LITTLE,
OKAY?

366
00:16:25,402 --> 00:16:26,320
J-JUST DON'T.

367
00:16:26,403 --> 00:16:28,113
HE'S TRYING TO BE A GOOD DAD.
LEAVE HIM ALONE.

368
00:16:28,197 --> 00:16:30,157
I CAN'T.
I CAN'T DO THAT!

369
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,075
I WON THE GAME.
DAD'S PROUD.

370
00:16:32,159 --> 00:16:33,076
DON'T RUIN IT.

371
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:35,245
DO YOU REALLY WANNA PRETEND
LIKE NOTHING EVER HAPPENED?

372
00:16:35,329 --> 00:16:36,246
FIGURE IT OUT, LUCAS.

373
00:16:36,330 --> 00:16:37,456
WHY DO YOU THINK
IT TOOK HIM SO LONG

374
00:16:37,539 --> 00:16:40,667
TO PUT ME TO BED?

375
00:16:40,751 --> 00:16:42,461
HE SAID THAT...

376
00:16:44,463 --> 00:16:45,797
HE SAID...

377
00:16:46,924 --> 00:16:49,092
YOU JUST TOOK FOREVER
TO FALL ASLEEP.

378
00:16:49,176 --> 00:16:53,013
DID HE TELL YOU
TO KEEP IT A SECRET TOO?

379
00:17:01,647 --> 00:17:03,106
CARLO:
THERE YOU GO.

380
00:17:03,190 --> 00:17:04,274
THERE YOU GO.

381
00:17:04,358 --> 00:17:06,151
IZZY AND CARLO:
(GIGGLE QUIETLY)

382
00:17:06,235 --> 00:17:07,903
JANE:
GET AWAY FROM HER.
NOW!

383
00:17:07,986 --> 00:17:09,363
WHAT'S WRONG?
WHY'D YOU MISS THE GAME?

384
00:17:09,446 --> 00:17:10,864
YOUR MOTHER IS VERY WORRIED.

385
00:17:10,948 --> 00:17:12,324
HOW COULD YOU
DO THAT TO ME?

386
00:17:12,407 --> 00:17:14,076
I WAS JUST A LITTLE GIRL.

387
00:17:14,159 --> 00:17:15,536
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT, JANIE.

388
00:17:15,619 --> 00:17:16,537
I REMEMBER.

389
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:18,580
I REMEMBER WHEN YOU WOULD
PUT ME TO BED,

390
00:17:18,664 --> 00:17:20,123
BEFORE YOU LEFT.
JANIE, PLEASE!

391
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:24,545
LOOK, I KNOW
YOU'RE NOT THRILLED

392
00:17:24,628 --> 00:17:25,546
I'M BACK IN
YOUR MOTHER'S LIFE,

393
00:17:25,629 --> 00:17:28,257
BUT THERE'S NO NEED
TO TELL STORIES.

394
00:17:28,340 --> 00:17:31,218
IT WAS A LONG TIME AGO.
YOU'RE CONFUSED.

395
00:17:31,301 --> 00:17:32,719
NO. NO, I'M NOT.

396
00:17:32,803 --> 00:17:33,887
HEY, BUDDY.

397
00:17:33,971 --> 00:17:37,140
YOUR SISTER'S MAKING UP
STORIES AGAIN.

398
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:41,061
NO.

399
00:17:42,729 --> 00:17:44,231
SHE'S GOT IT RIGHT.

400
00:17:44,314 --> 00:17:45,232
LUCAS, COME ON.

401
00:17:45,315 --> 00:17:46,817
YOU SHOULD GO.

402
00:17:48,151 --> 00:17:49,069
NO ONE IN THIS FAMILY

403
00:17:49,152 --> 00:17:50,654
EVER WANTS TO SEE
YOUR FACE AGAIN.

404
00:18:03,125 --> 00:18:04,459
(SHAKEN EXHALE)

405
00:18:15,429 --> 00:18:18,765
THOUGHT NINERS
WEREN'T YOUR STYLE.

406
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:22,603
IT'S ALL OVER
THE ANTI-GRAPEVINE.

407
00:18:22,686 --> 00:18:24,771
SO IS KC YOUR NEW SQUEEZE?

408
00:18:24,855 --> 00:18:26,356
I APOLOGIZED TO CLAIRE.

409
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:27,900
BESIDES,
WHAT DO YOU CARE?

410
00:18:27,983 --> 00:18:30,402
YOU DON'T WANT IT
TO BE YOU.

411
00:18:30,485 --> 00:18:32,863
AND YOU'RE SURE
ABOUT THAT?

412
00:18:32,946 --> 00:18:35,365
I DON'T LIKE KC.
I JUST...

413
00:18:36,366 --> 00:18:39,328
IT SEEMED LIKE A GOOD IDEA
AT THE TIME.

414
00:18:39,411 --> 00:18:40,579
I GET THAT.

415
00:18:40,662 --> 00:18:42,956
SOMETIMES I DO STUFF
AND DON'T KNOW WHY EITHER.

416
00:18:47,586 --> 00:18:48,795
DO YOU MISS HANGING OUT?

417
00:18:48,879 --> 00:18:50,422
IT'S COMPLICATED.

418
00:18:50,506 --> 00:18:51,423
NOT GOOD ENOUGH.

419
00:18:51,507 --> 00:18:54,885
I'M A BAD GUY,
BACKWOODS,

420
00:18:54,968 --> 00:18:56,094
AND YOU'RE BETTER OFF
WITHOUT ME.

421
00:18:56,178 --> 00:18:57,763
(SCOFFS)
OBVIOUSLY.

422
00:18:57,846 --> 00:18:59,681
YOU'RE AN IDIOT.

423
00:19:03,227 --> 00:19:06,355
YOU KNOW, IT DOESN'T MATTER
WHAT YOU WEAR, ALLI.

424
00:19:06,438 --> 00:19:07,898
YOU LOOK GOOD TO ME.

425
00:19:22,746 --> 00:19:24,623
WHEN UM...

426
00:19:24,706 --> 00:19:27,626
WHEN YOU WORKED
YOUR DOUBLE SHIFTS,

427
00:19:27,709 --> 00:19:29,044
HE'D TUCK ME IN.

428
00:19:30,045 --> 00:19:33,632
HE SAID HE WAS HELPING ME
GET TO SLEEP.

429
00:19:33,715 --> 00:19:37,886
HE TOLD ME MY PAJAMAS
WERE BUTTONED WRONG...

430
00:19:37,970 --> 00:19:40,806
AND HE SAID
HE WAS GONNA FIX THEM.

431
00:19:41,849 --> 00:19:43,100
IT WAS...

432
00:19:43,183 --> 00:19:44,768
IT WAS SO LONG AGO.

433
00:19:47,187 --> 00:19:50,649
HE'D CURL UP WITH ME
IN BED AND...

434
00:19:50,732 --> 00:19:52,025
AND TOUCH HIMSELF.

435
00:19:53,026 --> 00:19:54,486
(SNIFFLING)

436
00:19:54,570 --> 00:19:57,739
I GUESS LUCAS
WAS USUALLY WATCHING TV.

437
00:19:59,116 --> 00:20:01,159
WHY...

438
00:20:01,243 --> 00:20:03,203
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME?

439
00:20:04,413 --> 00:20:05,831
WHEN HE LEFT, I...

440
00:20:05,914 --> 00:20:06,832
I DIDN'T HAVE TO WORRY ANYMORE.

441
00:20:06,915 --> 00:20:09,168
I JUST THOUGHT WE WEREN'T
GONNA TALK ABOUT IT

442
00:20:09,251 --> 00:20:11,753
AND I THOUGHT MAYBE YOU'D THINK
IT WAS MY FAULT.

443
00:20:11,837 --> 00:20:15,382
EVELYN: (SOBBING)
OH, HONEY, I WOULD NEVER THINK
THAT IT'S YOUR FAULT.

444
00:20:15,465 --> 00:20:18,093
I WOULD NEVER THINK THAT.

445
00:20:20,554 --> 00:20:22,472
OH, I'M SO SORRY.

446
00:20:22,556 --> 00:20:23,557
BOTH:
(CRYING)

447
00:20:30,772 --> 00:20:33,775
DR. YABLONSKI:
TO START,
I WANT TO APPLAUD JANE

448
00:20:33,859 --> 00:20:37,863
FOR BEING BRAVE ENOUGH
TO SHARE HER STORY.

449
00:20:38,488 --> 00:20:39,990
THE HEALING PROCESS ISN'T EASY.

450
00:20:40,073 --> 00:20:43,285
BUT WITH ALL OF YOU
WORKING TOGETHER AS A FAMILY,

451
00:20:43,368 --> 00:20:46,038
THIS IS AN IMPORTANT
FIRST STEP.

452
00:20:48,916 --> 00:20:49,917
I'M SORRY.

453
00:20:52,252 --> 00:20:54,963
I WOULDN'T LET YOU TELL ME.

454
00:20:58,300 --> 00:21:00,344
I THOUGHT THAT YOU
WERE ASHAMED OF ME.

455
00:21:00,427 --> 00:21:03,597
I WANTED TO BELIEVE
THE BEST OF MY DAD.

456
00:21:04,598 --> 00:21:06,308
I DIDN'T PROTECT YOU.

457
00:21:07,142 --> 00:21:10,062
WE WERE JUST LITTLE KIDS.

458
00:21:10,145 --> 00:21:11,730
LUCAS:
STILL.

459
00:21:16,193 --> 00:21:18,028
YOU'RE HERE NOW.

460
00:21:21,031 --> 00:21:22,783
(RELIEVED HALF LAUGH)

461
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:25,744
(HALF LAUGHS)

462
00:21:27,829 --> 00:21:28,830
(DEEP SIGH)
