1
00:00:06,256 --> 00:00:07,508
SAV:
WELL, IT'S BEEN SIX MONTHS,
RIGHT?

2
00:00:07,591 --> 00:00:10,010
SO, I'M THINKING...

3
00:00:10,093 --> 00:00:12,971
WHOA!
ABOUT TIME, DUDE!

4
00:00:13,055 --> 00:00:14,765
DOES ANYA KNOW?

5
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:18,185
OH, OKAY, OKAY.

6
00:00:18,268 --> 00:00:19,436
I'M A SKILLED
MOTH COLLECTOR,

7
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:22,147
AND NOW THAT WE'LL BE
AWAY FROM STREET LAMPS,

8
00:00:22,231 --> 00:00:23,565
I'LL GET BETTER RESULTS.

9
00:00:23,649 --> 00:00:25,359
HEY, KID.

10
00:00:25,442 --> 00:00:27,569
UM, MY NAME
IS CONNOR.

11
00:00:27,653 --> 00:00:29,446
HEY, CONNOR,

12
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:30,531
SHUT UP.

13
00:00:30,614 --> 00:00:33,283
BUT I WAS JUST TELLING HIM
ABOUT MY MOTH COLLECTION.

14
00:00:33,367 --> 00:00:35,035
DON'T MAKE ME
POUND YOU.

15
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:37,037
I GET TO GO!

16
00:00:38,288 --> 00:00:39,206
WHY?

17
00:00:39,289 --> 00:00:41,124
IT'S AN EDUCATIONAL
OPPORTUNITY.

18
00:00:41,208 --> 00:00:43,627
AND I TOLD DAD
YOU'D KEEP AN EYE ON ME.

19
00:00:45,254 --> 00:00:46,171
THE THING IS THAT...

20
00:00:46,255 --> 00:00:47,422
THERE MIGHT BE
DIFFERNT ACTIVITIES

21
00:00:47,506 --> 00:00:48,423
FOR DIFFERENT GRADES.

22
00:00:48,507 --> 00:00:50,050
I MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO...

23
00:00:50,133 --> 00:00:51,301
BUT YOUR TOP PRIORITY

24
00:00:51,385 --> 00:00:52,970
WILL BE TO LOOK AFTER
YOUR SISTER.

25
00:00:53,053 --> 00:00:55,305
WON'T IT?

26
00:00:55,389 --> 00:00:56,890
YES, FATHER.

27
00:00:58,642 --> 00:00:59,643

I DO.
BUGS, COLD, WET.

45
00:02:02,915 --> 00:02:04,082
SO... WHY?

46
00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:06,293
BECAUSE I'M GOING
CATCH SOMETHING

47
00:02:06,376 --> 00:02:08,962
AND IT WON'T BE BUGS.

48
00:02:09,046 --> 00:02:10,422
YOU LIKE SOMEONE.

49
00:02:10,506 --> 00:02:11,757
WHO?

50
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:12,799
I'LL LET YOU KNOW
IF THINGS WORKOUT,

51
00:02:12,883 --> 00:02:15,010
BUT SAV CAN'T KNOW.

52
00:02:15,093 --> 00:02:16,011
WHY NOT?

53
00:02:16,094 --> 00:02:18,639
HE'S GOT A WHOLE DIFFERENT
SET OF RULES THAN I DO.

54
00:02:18,722 --> 00:02:20,474
BUT YOUR PARENTS
LET YOU COME ON THE TRIP.

55
00:02:20,557 --> 00:02:22,684
ONLY BECAUSE I SOLD EVERYONE
AT FAMILY DINNER

56
00:02:22,768 --> 00:02:25,103
WITH THE WHOLE
"EDUCATIONAL VALUE."

57
00:02:25,187 --> 00:02:28,190
FAMILY DINNER?
(HALF LAUGHS)

58
00:02:28,273 --> 00:02:29,358
WHO WAS THERE?

59
00:02:29,441 --> 00:02:31,610
AH, YOU KNOW, EVERYONE;
AUNTS, UNCLES, COUSINS.

60
00:02:31,693 --> 00:02:33,028
SO BORING!

61
00:02:38,492 --> 00:02:40,410
COME ON,
EVERYONE'S WAITING.

62
00:02:43,664 --> 00:02:44,581
ALL RIGHT, EVERYONE,

63
00:02:44,665 --> 00:02:47,000
WELCOME TO THE DEGRASSI ECOLOGY
AWARENESS TRIP.

64
00:02:47,084 --> 00:02:48,335
WOO-HOO!

65
00:02:48,418 --> 00:02:50,003
NOW, YOU ALL HAVE
TO FILL OUT THESE FORMS

66
00:02:50,087 --> 00:02:52,923
TO ASSESS YOUR CARBON FOOTPRINT
ON THE PLANET.

67
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:54,758
UM, WHERE IS ALLI
AND ANYA?

68
00:02:54,842 --> 00:02:55,843
UH, THEY'LL BE
RIGHT BACK.

69
00:03:01,765 --> 00:03:02,766
HI.

70
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:06,770
I'M ALLI.

71
00:03:06,854 --> 00:03:07,771
WHAT ARE YOU READING?

72
00:03:07,855 --> 00:03:09,523
A BOOK.

73
00:03:09,606 --> 00:03:12,067
THAT'S A JOKE,
RIGHT?

74
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:14,486
THAT WOULD BE CORRECT.

75
00:03:15,904 --> 00:03:17,865
YOU READY TO CELEBRATE
OUR SIX MONTH?

76
00:03:17,948 --> 00:03:18,866
THAT'S HANDY.

77
00:03:18,949 --> 00:03:21,451
NOW WE CAN SAY WE WENT OUT
FOR EXACTLY SIX MONTHS.

78
00:03:21,535 --> 00:03:23,036
I, I DON'T FOLLOW.

79
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:26,206
YOUR LAST FAMILY GATHERING
DIDN'T INCLUDE ME.

80
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:28,208
ALLI...
DIDN'T MEAN TO SPILL
THE BEANS.

81
00:03:28,292 --> 00:03:29,668
WE'RE DONE.

82
00:03:31,461 --> 00:03:34,631
DO THEY GIVE REFUNDS
ON CONDOMS?

83
00:03:39,636 --> 00:03:41,138
(SCHOOL BUS WHIRS)

84
00:03:58,155 --> 00:04:00,449
(LOW HUM OF CHATTER)

85
00:04:00,532 --> 00:04:04,119
DR. POLLOCK:
MAKE SURE YOU READ YOUR
ASSIGNMENT GUIDELINES CLOSELY.

86
00:04:04,203 --> 00:04:07,039
THEY CAN BE FOUND ONLINE
ON THE CLASS WEBSITE.

87
00:04:07,122 --> 00:04:09,291
AND LET MR. SILVERMAN,

88
00:04:09,374 --> 00:04:12,211
KNOW IF YOU HAVE ANY TROUBLE
LOGGING IN.

89
00:04:12,294 --> 00:04:14,296
PLEASE SETTLE DOWN, EVERYONE.

90
00:04:14,379 --> 00:04:15,714
TAKE YOUR SEATS.

91
00:04:15,797 --> 00:04:16,798
OH.

92
00:04:16,882 --> 00:04:18,675
THANKS.

93
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:21,428
CAN'T HAVE THE ROOMIE
GOING HUNGRY.

94
00:04:21,512 --> 00:04:23,347
YOU'RE THE BEST.

95
00:04:25,307 --> 00:04:27,601
DR. POLLOCK:
NOW, I WANT YOU TO PICK
A PARTNER

96
00:04:27,684 --> 00:04:28,602
AND YOU WILL WORK

97
00:04:28,685 --> 00:04:31,438
THROUGH A PERSONALITY
COMPATIBILITY TEST.

98
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:33,565
HE'S TAKEN.

99
00:04:33,649 --> 00:04:39,696
DR. POLLOCK:
AND THEN GIVE A NON-CLINICAL
PSYCHOLOGICAL REPORT, OKAY?

100
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:41,323
NOW, IF SOMEBODY
CAN HIT THE LIGHTS?

101
00:04:41,406 --> 00:04:43,534
UH, LET'S GET STARTED.

102
00:04:44,535 --> 00:04:46,828
REPORTER:
ENVIRONMENTAL GROUP'S
EXPANDED THEIR PROGRAMMING

103
00:04:46,912 --> 00:04:49,414

HAVE JOINED...

104
00:04:49,498 --> 00:04:51,834
EMMA:
I'M FREEZING.
ARE YOU GUYS COLD?

105
00:04:51,917 --> 00:04:52,918
SHHH!

106
00:05:01,051 --> 00:05:01,969
HOW'S THAT?

107
00:05:02,052 --> 00:05:03,679
GOOD. THANKS.

108
00:05:10,269 --> 00:05:11,854
SO GRAB YOUR BELONGINGS,

109
00:05:11,937 --> 00:05:13,480
SET UP YOUR CAMP,

110
00:05:13,564 --> 00:05:15,399
AND THEN WE'LL START
OUR GAME OF SURVIVAL.

111
00:05:15,482 --> 00:05:16,400
OKAY, NOW REMEMBER,

112
00:05:16,483 --> 00:05:18,151
YOU'RE GONNA BE DIVIDED
INTO HERBIVORES,

113
00:05:18,235 --> 00:05:19,653
OMNIVORES,
AND CARNIVORES.

114
00:05:19,736 --> 00:05:21,280
AND THE ONLY WAY YOU CAN WIN

115
00:05:21,363 --> 00:05:24,575
IS TO BE ALIVE AT THE END
OF THE GAME, ALL RIGHT?

116
00:05:24,658 --> 00:05:25,993
(HUM OF CHATTER)

117
00:05:27,286 --> 00:05:31,164
YOU GONNA FREEZE ME OUT
THIS WHOLE TRIP?

118
00:05:31,248 --> 00:05:32,332
I WANTED TO INVITE YOU.

119
00:05:32,416 --> 00:05:35,169
BUT MY UNCLE JUST
LOST HIS JOB...

121
00:05:36,962 --> 00:05:38,755
IT DIDN'T REALLY SEEM
LIKE THE BEST TIME.

122
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:45,220
I, I WROTE A SONG FOR YOU.

123
00:05:45,304 --> 00:05:48,640
I'LL SING IT TO YOU,
IF YOU LET ME.

00:05:51,727 --> 00:05:52,769

I DON'T KNOW, HON,

165
00:07:23,193 --> 00:07:25,571
HE'S BEEN SENDING ME
SOME PRETTY STRONG SIGNALS.

166

174

UH, I DON'T KNOW
HOW TO PUT THIS, BUT...

I GUESS.

181
00:07:57,686 --> 00:08:00,647
BUT AREN'T YOU CURIOUS
WHO HE'D GO FOR?

182
00:08:00,731 --> 00:08:01,648
NO.

183
00:08:01,732 --> 00:08:03,525
WELL, OUR COMPATIBILITY
ASSIGNMENT

184
00:08:03,609 --> 00:08:04,776

185
00:08:05,569 --> 00:08:07,070
WELL, JUST FOR FUN,
OF COURSE.

186
00:08:07,154 --> 00:08:08,322
OH, OF COURSE.

187
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,455
CONNER:
WAIT 'TIL YOU SEE!

188
00:08:16,538 --> 00:08:17,915
THE WHITE SHEET
ALMOST LOOKS BLACK

189
00:08:17,998 --> 00:08:22,377
BECAUSE SO MANY MOTHS
AND OTHER INSECTS LAND ON IT.

190
00:08:22,461 --> 00:08:24,338
STILL BORING YOUR FRIENDS
TO DEATH?

191
00:08:25,547 --> 00:08:28,091

OR NOT.

194
00:08:33,263 --> 00:08:34,556
LISTEN, KID, I'M DOING YOU
A FAVOUR, ALL RIGHT?

195
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,808
NOBODY WANTS TO HEAR YOU TALK
ABOUT SPOTTED MOTHS ANY MORE.

196
00:08:37,809 --> 00:08:39,228
YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE
DONE THAT.

197
00:08:45,108 --> 00:08:47,819
OH, I'M SCARED.

198
00:08:47,903 --> 00:08:49,279
I'M SCARED.

199
00:08:57,621 --> 00:09:01,166
PERSONALLY, I, UH,
I HATE SPOTTED MOTHS.

200
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:03,335
WANNA GO FOR A WALK?

201
00:09:05,838 --> 00:09:08,215
OKAY, LET'S SEE,

PERSONALITY."

203
00:09:11,009 --> 00:09:13,887
FROM "VERY TRUE"
TO "VERY UNTRUE."

204
00:09:13,971 --> 00:09:16,890
"VERY TRUE,"
I WOULD SAY.

205
00:09:16,974 --> 00:09:18,392
SERIOUSLY?

206
00:09:18,475 --> 00:09:20,185

217
00:09:41,665 --> 00:09:43,417
OKAY, UM...

219
00:09:47,171 --> 00:09:48,839
LOOKS LIKE IT'S A DRAW.

220
00:09:50,132 --> 00:09:51,133
HMM.

COME ON, I HEARD
THAT YOU AND ANYA

224
00:09:56,597 --> 00:09:57,806
WERE MAKING OUT
IN THE WOODS.

225
00:09:57,890 --> 00:10:00,058
THAT SHOULD'VE GIVEN YOU
AN APPETITE.

226
00:10:00,142 --> 00:10:03,270
MY DAD PACKED ME
AND MY SISTER SOME FOOD.

227
00:10:03,353 --> 00:10:07,024
FUNNY THAT YOU TOO ARE THE ONES
GETTING ALL THE ACTION.

228
00:10:07,107 --> 00:10:08,483
WHAT?

229
00:10:08,567 --> 00:10:10,235
WORD IS
YOU'RE NOT THE ONLY BHANDARI

230
00:10:10,319 --> 00:10:11,653
WHO'S BEEN BUSY
IN THE WOODS.

231
00:10:13,697 --> 00:10:15,032
I GOTTA GO.

232
00:10:16,033 --> 00:10:17,159
WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN UP TO?

233
00:10:17,242 --> 00:10:18,202
JOHNNY BROKE CONNOR'S NET,

234
00:10:18,285 --> 00:10:21,163
BUT WE'RE LOOKING FOR MOTHS

00:10:21,246 --> 00:10:22,789
HAVE YOU HEARD
YOUR NEW NICKNAME?

236
00:10:22,873 --> 00:10:23,540
NO.

237
00:10:23,624 --> 00:10:24,917

239
00:10:27,085 --> 00:10:28,837
THAT'S AWESOME.

240
00:10:28,921 --> 00:10:30,297
YOU WANT THEM
TO CALL YOU THAT?

241
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:32,466
AH, IT'S COOLER THAN
"SAV'S LITTLE SISTER"

242
00:10:32,549 --> 00:10:33,884
OR "NINER GEEK."

243
00:10:34,718 --> 00:10:37,137
YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU BETTER GO TO YOUR TENT.

244
00:10:37,221 --> 00:10:38,639
WHY?
I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING!

245
00:10:38,722 --> 00:10:39,640
YOU'RE SUCH A HYPOCRITE.

246
00:10:39,723 --> 00:10:42,809
I SAW THAT PACK OF CONDOMS
YOU BROUGHT.

247
00:10:42,893 --> 00:10:44,811
YOU HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

248
00:10:44,895 --> 00:10:45,812
AND YOU'RE WORRIED ABOUT

249
00:10:45,896 --> 00:10:47,397
WHAT PEOPLE MIGHT THINK
ABOUT ME.

250
00:10:47,481 --> 00:10:49,525
GO TO YOUR TENT, NOW!

251
00:10:49,608 --> 00:10:51,026
SO UNFAIR!

252
00:10:54,738 --> 00:10:56,406
ANYA:
HE'S JUST WORRIED ABOUT
HIS LITTLE SISTER.

253
00:10:56,490 --> 00:10:58,242
IT'S WHAT BIG BROTHERS DO.

254
00:10:58,325 --> 00:11:01,537
ALLI:
NO, HE'S WORRIED ABOUT
OUR FAMILY'S REPUTATION.

255
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:03,747
WELL, IT'S 'CAUSE
HE CARES ABOUT YOU.

256
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:06,667
MAYBE, BUT HE SOUNDS
JUST LIKE MY DAD.

257
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:07,918
IS THAT SO TERRIBLE?

258
00:11:08,001 --> 00:11:08,919
IT'S HARD TO EXPLAIN.

259
00:11:09,002 --> 00:11:11,964
YOU'D GET IT
IF YOU EVER MET MY FATHER.

260
00:11:12,047 --> 00:11:13,632
YEAH, WISH I COULD.

261
00:11:13,715 --> 00:11:14,716

262
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:15,717
FAMILY DINNERS WOULD BE

263
00:11:15,801 --> 00:11:17,970
WAY LESS BORING
WITH YOU THERE.

264
00:11:18,053 --> 00:11:19,096
THANKS.

265
00:11:21,098 --> 00:11:22,224
SO, WHAT DO YOU THINK
IT WOULD TAKE...

266
00:11:22,307 --> 00:11:25,686

WH-WHAT IS GOING ON?!

355
00:16:05,549 --> 00:16:07,301
EVERYONE,
GO BACK TO YOUR TENTS!

356
00:16:07,384 --> 00:16:09,261
THE TENTS YOU'RE SUPPOSED
TO BE IN, ALL RIGHT?

357
00:16:09,344 --> 00:16:11,889
GO BACK!
NOW, EVERYONE, GO!

358
00:16:11,972 --> 00:16:13,557
FASTER! FASTER! FASTER!

359
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:15,017
COME ON!

360
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:16,476
(STUDENT CHATTER)

361
00:16:18,145 --> 00:16:21,064
LIBERTY:
KELLY AND I DISCOVERED
WE ARE COMPATIBLE AS FRIENDS

362
00:16:21,148 --> 00:16:22,274
OR ROOMMATES

363
00:16:22,357 --> 00:16:24,234
BECAUSE WE ARE BOTH ORGANIZED

364
00:16:24,318 --> 00:16:26,236
AND LIKE HIGH LEVELS
OF EXCITEMENT.

365
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:29,865
KELLY:
BUT FOUND THAT WE WOULD BE
COMPLETELY INCOMPATIBLE AS MATES

366
00:16:29,948 --> 00:16:31,950
BECAUSE WE HAVE
VERY DIFFERENT GOALS.

367
00:16:32,034 --> 00:16:34,995
DR. POLLOCK:
THANK YOU.
THAT WAS EXCELLENT WORK.

368
00:16:35,078 --> 00:16:36,580
NELSON AND SANTOS?

369
00:16:39,333 --> 00:16:41,627
UM... (CLEARS THROAT)

370
00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:46,215
I'M AFRAID WE'RE NOT READY
FOR OUR PRESENTATION.

371
00:16:47,633 --> 00:16:49,676
I SEE.
AND WHY WOULD THAT BE?

372
00:16:50,677 --> 00:16:52,095
WELL...

373
00:16:52,179 --> 00:16:56,225
WE GOT CAUGHT UP IN SOME
SUPPLEMENTARY RESEARCH.

374
00:16:56,308 --> 00:16:57,309
I SEE.

375
00:16:59,561 --> 00:17:02,064
SUPPLEMENTARY RESEARCH?

376
00:17:02,147 --> 00:17:03,857
HE'S FAILED US.

377
00:17:05,651 --> 00:17:08,570
BOYS ON THE LEFT.
GIRLS ON THE RIGHT.

378
00:17:08,654 --> 00:17:10,739
SORRY, I CAN'T TRUST YOU
AFTER LAST NIGHT.

379
00:17:10,822 --> 00:17:12,783
YOU ARE NOT GOING TO TELL DAD.

380
00:17:12,866 --> 00:17:14,159
SAV:
GIVE ME ONE REASON NOT TO.

381
00:17:14,243 --> 00:17:15,953
WE WERE JUST
PLAYING CARDS.

382
00:17:16,036 --> 00:17:17,079
WHO CARES
WHAT YOU WERE DOING?

383
00:17:17,162 --> 00:17:18,622
YOU KNOW
WHAT EVERYONE THINKS.

384
00:17:18,705 --> 00:17:20,207
WHAT ABOUT YOU AND ANYA?
WHAT WERE YOU DOING?

385
00:17:20,290 --> 00:17:21,667
YOU HAD YOUR SHIRT OFF.

386
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:23,252
WELL, WE'RE NOT TALKING
ABOUT ME AND ANYA.

387
00:17:23,335 --> 00:17:24,253
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT YOU.

388
00:17:24,336 --> 00:17:26,129
I'M NOT AN IMPURE GIRL!

389
00:17:26,213 --> 00:17:27,714
SAV:
PEOPLE ARE GOING THINK YOU ARE.

390
00:17:27,798 --> 00:17:29,800
THEY'LL SAY YOU'RE NOT
GOOD ENOUGH FOR THEIR FAMILY.

391
00:17:29,883 --> 00:17:31,260
IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT?

392
00:17:32,261 --> 00:17:33,178
(SARCASTIC TONE)
YES, RIGHT,

393
00:17:33,262 --> 00:17:34,263
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT I WANT.

394
00:17:39,101 --> 00:17:40,644
WE LOST A WHOLE LETTER GRADE.

395
00:17:40,727 --> 00:17:41,687
NOW WE HAVE TO WORK
JUST AS HARD

396
00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:43,814
AND THE BEST
WE CAN HOPE FOR IS A "B."

397
00:17:43,897 --> 00:17:44,815
WHAT'S THAT?

398
00:17:44,898 --> 00:17:46,984
IS THAT THE SOUND
OF A VERY RELAXED PERSONALITY?

399
00:17:47,067 --> 00:17:49,236
SERIOUSLY, THIS IS BAD.
WE'RE HERE FOR SCHOOL.

400
00:17:49,319 --> 00:17:52,531
WE SHOULD NEVER HAVE GONE DOWN
THE KELLY ROAD.

401
00:17:52,614 --> 00:17:53,699
WHAT?

402
00:17:53,782 --> 00:17:55,200
HE'S SO CUTE,

403
00:17:55,284 --> 00:17:56,201
AND WE HAVE TO LIVE
WITH HIM.

404
00:17:56,285 --> 00:17:57,202
THAT'S A LOT OF TENSION,
RIGHT?

405
00:17:57,286 --> 00:17:58,412
MANNY!

406
00:17:58,495 --> 00:18:00,205
WHAT WOULD BE THE HARM
IN ASKING HIM?

407
00:18:00,289 --> 00:18:01,999
FOR FUN,
OF COURSE.

408
00:18:02,082 --> 00:18:03,000
MANNY, NO.

409
00:18:03,083 --> 00:18:05,002
AND IF HE HAPPENS TO LIKE
ONE OF US...

410
00:18:05,085 --> 00:18:06,670
THEN WE CAN MAKE
A MATURE DECISION

411
00:18:06,753 --> 00:18:08,338
ON HOW TO PROCEED.

412
00:18:09,339 --> 00:18:10,340
LOOK, IF YOU'RE UNCOMFORTABLE
WITH THAT,

413
00:18:10,424 --> 00:18:12,509
I CAN JUST TELL HIM
I LIKE HIM.

414
00:18:12,593 --> 00:18:13,677
NOT IF I TELL HIM FIRST!

415
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:16,763
(MANNY AND EMMA GIGGLE)

416
00:18:18,265 --> 00:18:19,183
KELLY:
UH... (STAMMERS)

417
00:18:19,266 --> 00:18:21,768
GUYS?!
THE SOCK ON THE DOOR?

418
00:18:21,852 --> 00:18:22,978
OH...

419
00:18:23,061 --> 00:18:25,272
WE SHOULD GO.
THE SOCK.

420
00:18:25,355 --> 00:18:26,356
YEAH.

421
00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:31,236
LOOK AT THIS.

422
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:32,321
(GASPS)

423
00:18:35,782 --> 00:18:37,534
MANNY AND EMMA:
(LAUGH)

424
00:18:37,618 --> 00:18:38,827
(LOW HUM OF STUDENT CHATTER)

425
00:18:42,956 --> 00:18:44,458
SAV:
HEY, I'LL CALL YOU TONIGHT.

426
00:18:44,541 --> 00:18:46,293
I WOULDN'T HAVE THOUGHT
YOU'D HAVE ANYTHING TO SAY

427
00:18:46,376 --> 00:18:47,836
TO AN IMPURE GIRL.

428
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:49,379
I WASN'T TALKING ABOUT YOU.

429
00:18:49,463 --> 00:18:50,339
WELL, YOU COULD HAVE BEEN.

430
00:18:50,422 --> 00:18:52,716
I WAS ALONE IN A TENT,
WITH A BOY.

431
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:54,551
JUST LIKE ALLI.

432
00:18:54,635 --> 00:18:56,053
IT'S NOT THE SAME THOUGH.

433
00:18:56,136 --> 00:18:57,221
SURE IT IS.

434
00:18:57,304 --> 00:18:58,305
WE WANTED TO BE TOGETHER

435
00:18:58,388 --> 00:19:00,724
AND NOW, ACCORDING TO YOUR
DOUBLE STANDARD,

436
00:19:00,807 --> 00:19:04,895
I'M NOT GOOD ENOUGH FOR YOU
OR YOUR FAMILY.

437
00:19:13,987 --> 00:19:15,155
HEY.

438
00:19:15,239 --> 00:19:16,532
WE DON'T GET IT.

439
00:19:17,533 --> 00:19:19,993
THE SOCIOLOGICAL PSYCHOLOGICAL
MEASURES CHAPTER?

440
00:19:20,077 --> 00:19:21,203
ME NEITHER.

441
00:19:21,286 --> 00:19:22,287
NO, YOU.

442
00:19:23,372 --> 00:19:24,414
MANNY:
I MEAN...

443
00:19:24,498 --> 00:19:26,291
YOU WALK AROUND HERE
FLIRTING WITH US

444
00:19:26,375 --> 00:19:28,961
AND THEN WE FIND YOU
MAKING OUT WITH GWYNETH.

445
00:19:29,044 --> 00:19:30,170
WHAT?

446
00:19:30,254 --> 00:19:32,130
WELL, YOU'RE ALWAYS
SO COMFORTING.

447
00:19:32,214 --> 00:19:33,298
AND THOUGHTFUL.

448
00:19:33,382 --> 00:19:34,842
LIKE, WHAT'S THAT ABOUT?

449
00:19:34,925 --> 00:19:36,093
BEING A GOOD ROOMMATE.

450
00:19:37,553 --> 00:19:41,598
SO, YOU'RE NOT INTO
EITHER ONE OF US LIKE THAT?

451
00:19:42,599 --> 00:19:44,017
WE'RE ROOMMATES -
NO DATING.

452
00:19:44,101 --> 00:19:45,519
WASN'T THAT THE DEAL?

453
00:19:45,602 --> 00:19:47,521
YOU'RE NOT ANSWERING
THE QUESTION.

454
00:19:47,604 --> 00:19:48,522
TO BE HONEST,

455
00:19:48,605 --> 00:19:50,482
YOU'RE A LITTLE SCARY
RIGHT NOW.

456
00:19:52,359 --> 00:19:54,236
YOU'RE BOTH FANTASTIC.

457
00:19:55,237 --> 00:19:57,698
AND... YES, IF IT WASN'T FOR
THE NO ROOMMATE DATING RULE,

458
00:19:57,781 --> 00:19:59,783
I WOULD DEFINITELY BE
INTO ONE OF YOU.

459
00:20:02,953 --> 00:20:03,954
(HALF LAUGHS)

460
00:20:05,122 --> 00:20:07,207
I'M GONNA GO STUDY
AT THE LIBRARY.

461
00:20:09,793 --> 00:20:12,045
I'LL TRY TO BE A LITTLE LESS...
COMFORTING AND THOUGHTFUL

462
00:20:12,129 --> 00:20:13,297
WHEN I GET BACK.

463
00:20:15,966 --> 00:20:18,635
DEFINITELY INTO ONE OF US?

464
00:20:18,719 --> 00:20:19,970
WHICH ONE?

465
00:20:20,971 --> 00:20:22,848
WE CAN'T GO THERE.

466
00:20:23,849 --> 00:20:24,850
NOPE.

467
00:20:27,895 --> 00:20:29,313
(STUDENT CHATTER)

468
00:20:32,316 --> 00:20:34,067
I TEXTED HER TWENTY TIMES
SINCE WE GOT BACK.

469
00:20:34,151 --> 00:20:35,152
NOTHING.

470
00:20:35,235 --> 00:20:37,237
SHE'LL BE HERE ANY SECOND
SAYING "OH SAV,

471
00:20:37,321 --> 00:20:40,157
LET'S NEVER
BREAK UP AGAIN."

472
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:42,367
YOU SEE?

473
00:20:45,495 --> 00:20:48,373
I'M SORRY
IF I PRESSURED YOU.

474
00:20:48,457 --> 00:20:51,627
WE CAN WAIT
AS LONG AS YOU WANT.

475
00:20:53,045 --> 00:20:55,255
I JUST WANNA HANG OUT
WITH YOU.

476
00:20:55,339 --> 00:20:57,674
AND I NEVER GOT
TO PLAY YOU MY SONG.

477
00:20:57,758 --> 00:21:00,552
WOMEN ARE EQUAL TO MEN.

478
00:21:00,636 --> 00:21:01,553
WELL, YEAH.

479
00:21:01,637 --> 00:21:02,930
SO, IF WHAT I DID
WAS BAD,

480
00:21:03,013 --> 00:21:06,850
THEN YOU WERE JUST AS WRONG
TO BE WITH ME.

481
00:21:06,934 --> 00:21:09,770
I, I DON'T THINK
YOU'RE BAD.

482
00:21:10,896 --> 00:21:12,356
(STAMMERS)
I'M SORRY.

483
00:21:12,439 --> 00:21:14,191
I JUST MEANT...

484
00:21:14,274 --> 00:21:16,568
IT'S GOT EVERYTHING
YOU EVER GAVE ME IN IT.

485
00:21:16,652 --> 00:21:18,612
THE CDS,
THE STUDZ T-SHIRT,

486
00:21:18,695 --> 00:21:20,155
THE POEM,
THE BRACELET,

487
00:21:20,239 --> 00:21:22,199
AND...STICKERS.
