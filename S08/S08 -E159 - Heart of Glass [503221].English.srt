A LOT.

355
00:18:29,067 --> 00:18:32,988
I DON'T THINK
WE SHOULD HANG OUT ANYMORE.

356
00:18:37,659 --> 00:18:39,244
SHEP:
SO... LET'S GO OUTSIDE

357
00:18:39,328 --> 00:18:42,623
AND GET A PHOTOGRAPH OF YOU
FOR THE YEARBOOK.

358
00:18:47,669 --> 00:18:48,921
HEY.

359
00:18:49,004 --> 00:18:50,631
HOW 'BOUT DINNER
AT THE DOT?

360
00:18:50,714 --> 00:18:53,800
I WON'T WAIT FOR YOU
TO PICK ME.

361
00:18:54,801 --> 00:18:57,137
YOU DON'T HAVE TO.

362
00:18:57,221 --> 00:18:59,890
I TOLD DARCE
I'M NOT COMING TO KENYA.

363
00:18:59,973 --> 00:19:01,517
"LOVE THE ONE YOU'RE WITH,"
RIGHT?

364
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:02,601
(SCOFFS IN DISBELIEF)

365
00:19:02,684 --> 00:19:05,062
"WHEN YOU CAN'T BE
WITH THE ONE YOU LOVE."

366
00:19:05,145 --> 00:19:06,522
REAL ROMANTIC, PETER.

367
00:19:07,773 --> 00:19:09,107
OKAY, THE WORDS
ARE COMING OUT ALL WRONG,

368
00:19:09,191 --> 00:19:12,361
BUT WHAT I'M TRYING TO SAY
IS...

369
00:19:13,362 --> 00:19:15,197
I CHOOSE YOU.

370
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:17,574
THE FACT THAT YOU WERE
EVEN CONSIDERING LEAVING

371
00:19:17,658 --> 00:19:21,578
MEANS THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING
SERIOUSLY WRONG WITH US.

372
00:19:21,662 --> 00:19:23,872
I LOVE DARCY.
I PROBABLY ALWAYS WILL.

373
00:19:23,956 --> 00:19:25,415
BUT...

374
00:19:25,499 --> 00:19:28,585
I'M FALLING IN LOVE
WITH YOU.

375
00:19:28,669 --> 00:19:30,337
YOU DON'T GET IT,
DO YOU?

376
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:33,799
I'M NOT GONNA BE
YOUR CONSOLATION PRIZE.

377
00:19:33,882 --> 00:19:36,051
WE NEED TO BREAK UP.

378
00:19:45,811 --> 00:19:47,312
SO THAT'S IT?
YOU GUYS ARE THROUGH?

379
00:19:47,396 --> 00:19:48,689
THERE ARE SOME THINGS
I'M NOT WILLING TO DO

380
00:19:48,772 --> 00:19:50,065
TO BE IN A RELATIONSHIP.

381
00:19:50,148 --> 00:19:53,318
BUT YOU STILL WANNA
BE WITH HIM?

382
00:19:54,069 --> 00:19:55,487
THEN TELL HIM THAT.

383
00:19:55,571 --> 00:19:57,906
WHAT IF HE DOESN'T WANNA BE
WITH ME ANYMORE?

384
00:19:57,990 --> 00:19:59,658
THEN HE SUCKS.

385
00:20:03,912 --> 00:20:05,455
IT'S BETTER TO KNOW THAT NOW.

386
00:20:17,718 --> 00:20:19,344
I'M NOT GONNA HAVE
SEX AGAIN

387
00:20:19,428 --> 00:20:21,263
FOR A LONG TIME.

388
00:20:28,770 --> 00:20:30,105
AND, UH...

389
00:20:30,814 --> 00:20:32,983
WHY SHOULD I WORRY
ABOUT THAT?

390
00:20:33,066 --> 00:20:36,069
'CAUSE I'D LIKE
TO KEEP HANGING OUT.

391
00:20:36,153 --> 00:20:37,404
AND YOU WON'T PRESSURE ME
TO DO ANYTHING

392
00:20:37,487 --> 00:20:38,655
I'M NOT READY FOR?

393
00:20:38,739 --> 00:20:40,991
YOU'RE SUCH AN IDIOT.

394
00:20:44,953 --> 00:20:46,955
I WAS A VIRGIN TOO.

395
00:20:50,459 --> 00:20:52,544
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME?

396
00:20:52,628 --> 00:20:54,630
I DIDN'T THINK THAT WAS
THE GUY YOU WANTED.

397
00:20:54,713 --> 00:20:56,798
AND ALL THOSE OTHER GIRLS?

398
00:20:56,882 --> 00:20:59,176
I NEVER STUCK AROUND
LONG ENOUGH.

399
00:20:59,259 --> 00:21:00,469
(HALF LAUGHS)

400
00:21:01,470 --> 00:21:04,723
SO I DIDN'T HAVE TO?
I MEAN...

401
00:21:04,806 --> 00:21:07,309
YOU WOULDN'T HAVE CARED
IF I HADN'T?

402
00:21:07,392 --> 00:21:11,813
I WISH I COULD CHANGE A LOT
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED,

403
00:21:11,897 --> 00:21:14,483
BUT NOT THAT I WAS WITH YOU.

404
00:21:17,569 --> 00:21:20,906
SO WE CAN TAKE THINGS
SLOWLY?

405
00:21:20,989 --> 00:21:23,242
YOU KNOW IT'S IMPOSSIBLE
TO SAY NO TO YOU, RIGHT?
