00:15:49,908 --> 00:15:51,910
THAT'S HEAVY.
AH...

355
00:15:51,994 --> 00:15:53,704
PROBABLY SHOULD DITCH
THE REST OF THE GOODS.

356
00:15:53,787 --> 00:15:56,540
WELL, BECCA'S GONNA BE OKAY.

357
00:15:56,623 --> 00:15:57,875
STILL.

358
00:15:57,958 --> 00:16:02,379
IF WE WEREN'T STONED,
IT NEVER WOULDA HAPPENED.

359
00:16:12,514 --> 00:16:14,266
(KC'S BAG THUMPS DOWN)

360
00:16:15,267 --> 00:16:17,311
DID YOU TELL REESE
WHERE I LIVE?

361
00:16:17,394 --> 00:16:18,812
WHAT? NO.

362
00:16:18,896 --> 00:16:21,523
THEN, HOW DID HE KNOW?

363
00:16:21,607 --> 00:16:23,942
I LOOKED THAT PLACE UP.
WHERE YOU LIVE?

364
00:16:24,026 --> 00:16:25,652
YOU'VE GOTTA DO BAD STUFF
TO LIVE THERE.

365
00:16:25,736 --> 00:16:27,362
I THOUGHT
IT WOULD SCARE REESE.

366
00:16:27,446 --> 00:16:29,198
BUT YOU SWORE
YOU WOULDN'T TELL.

367
00:16:29,281 --> 00:16:30,908
NOW EVERYONE KNOWS.

368
00:16:30,991 --> 00:16:32,701
I THOUGHT IT WOULD HELP.

369
00:16:32,784 --> 00:16:34,244
WHAT DOES IT MATTER
IF PEOPLE KNOW WHERE YOU LIVE?

370
00:16:34,328 --> 00:16:36,496
I DON'T WANT THEM TO KNOW
WHY I LIVE THERE.

371
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:38,290
THEY'LL THINK
I'M A "BAD KID".

372
00:16:38,373 --> 00:16:40,125
BUT YOU'RE NOT.

373
00:16:40,209 --> 00:16:41,627
TELL THAT TO EVERYONE ELSE.

374
00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:43,337
MY OLD SCHOOL.
MY FOSTER PARENTS.

375
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:44,880
THE JUDGE.

376
00:16:44,963 --> 00:16:46,423
AND NOW THANKS TO YOU,

377
00:16:46,507 --> 00:16:48,217
EVERYONE AT DEGRASSI.

378
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:49,051
I DON'T THINK THAT.

379
00:16:49,134 --> 00:16:50,719
AND YOUR FRIENDS WON'T
EITHER.

380
00:16:50,802 --> 00:16:52,054
WE KNOW YOU.

381
00:16:52,137 --> 00:16:53,639
YOU SAY THAT NOW.

382
00:16:53,722 --> 00:16:55,891
BUT WHEN PEOPLE FIND OUT?

383
00:16:56,892 --> 00:16:59,311
THEY JUST WRITE ME OFF.

384
00:17:01,522 --> 00:17:02,523
(DOOR OPENS)

385
00:17:06,527 --> 00:17:07,569
HEY.

386
00:17:07,653 --> 00:17:09,196
DID YOU HEAR ABOUT BECCA?

387
00:17:09,279 --> 00:17:11,406
YEAH MAN, HARSH BUZZ.
I DITCHED MY STASH

388
00:17:11,490 --> 00:17:14,701
AS SOON AS I HEARD THE NARCS
WERE DOING SEARCHES.

389
00:17:14,785 --> 00:17:15,577
NARCS?

390
00:17:15,661 --> 00:17:17,037
WELL, CAMPUS COPS.

391
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:19,164
LOOKING FOR BECCA'S HOOK UP.

392
00:17:19,248 --> 00:17:20,374
THEY ROLLED MY ROOM.

393
00:17:20,457 --> 00:17:23,126
DO YOU THINK THEY KNOW
ABOUT ME?

394
00:17:23,836 --> 00:17:26,004
I DON'T KNOW, BLAZE.

395
00:17:28,298 --> 00:17:29,716
BLAZE...

396
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:30,926
CRAP!

397
00:17:31,009 --> 00:17:33,136
(PHONE BEEPS AND SPEED DIALS)

398
00:17:34,137 --> 00:17:35,430
KELLY, ARE YOU IN THE ROOM?

399
00:17:35,514 --> 00:17:37,224
KELLY:
EM, WHAT'S UP?

400
00:17:37,307 --> 00:17:38,892
I DIDN'T GET RID OF IT.

401
00:17:38,976 --> 00:17:41,728
THERE'S STILL BROWNIES
AND WEED IN THE ROOM.

402
00:17:41,812 --> 00:17:43,730
THEY'RE DOING SEARCHES!

403
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:46,775
CAMPUS SECURITY:
THIS WAY?

404
00:17:46,859 --> 00:17:47,860
KELLY:
UNGH!

405
00:17:56,451 --> 00:17:57,995
VICKIE:
YOU NEED TO COME WITH ME.

406
00:17:58,078 --> 00:17:59,496
SORRY, KEL.

407
00:18:06,211 --> 00:18:08,297
EMMA:
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

408
00:18:14,970 --> 00:18:16,722
MANNY:
KELLY'S STILL NOT BACK.
WE'RE ALL GETTING KICKED OUT.

409
00:18:18,015 --> 00:18:19,725
I'M GONNA HAVE TO SLEEP
ON THE STREETS.

410
00:18:19,808 --> 00:18:20,767
THERE GOES LAW SCHOOL.

411
00:18:20,851 --> 00:18:22,728
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU PUT US ALL AT RISK.

412
00:18:22,811 --> 00:18:23,896
EMMA:
LOOK.

413
00:18:23,979 --> 00:18:25,731
NO NOBODY'S SLEEPING
ON THE STREETS

414
00:18:25,814 --> 00:18:27,816
OR GETTING KICKED OUT
OF LAW SCHOOL.

415
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:30,652
THIS IS MY FAULT.
I'LL TELL THEM.

416
00:18:40,704 --> 00:18:42,122
PA ANNOUNCEMENT:
ATTENTION, STUDENTS,
THIS IS A REMINDER

417
00:18:42,206 --> 00:18:43,624
THAT THE SOUTH SIDE
OF THE PARKING LOT

418
00:18:43,707 --> 00:18:44,958

419
00:18:45,042 --> 00:18:47,294
ANY STUDENTS CARS
WILL BE TOWED.

(HUM OF CHATTER)

421
00:18:56,887 --> 00:18:58,722
SO, HOW WAS THE LAST TRY-OUT?

422
00:18:58,805 --> 00:19:00,432
KC:
DECENT.

423
00:19:00,516 --> 00:19:02,768
I THINK I'LL MAKE IT.

424
00:19:05,229 --> 00:19:08,565
DID YOU REALLY DO
WHAT REESE SAID?

425
00:19:11,693 --> 00:19:14,530
MY FRIENDS AND I
FROM MY LAST SCHOOL...

426
00:19:14,613 --> 00:19:17,533
WE USED TO FIND INTERESTING
WAYS TO PASS THE TIME.

427
00:19:17,616 --> 00:19:19,368
LIKE STEALING CARS?

428
00:19:20,327 --> 00:19:22,829
LIKE LOTS OF THINGS
YOU DON'T WANNA KNOW ABOUT.

429
00:19:22,913 --> 00:19:25,499
WHY CAN'T YOU TALK TO ME
ABOUT THIS?

430
00:19:25,582 --> 00:19:27,251
YOU HAD THIS IDEA OF ME.

431
00:19:27,334 --> 00:19:29,503
THAT I'M A GOOD GUY.

432
00:19:30,546 --> 00:19:32,256
I LIKED IT.

433
00:19:32,339 --> 00:19:34,007
NOW CONNOR WENT
AND RUINED IT.

434
00:19:34,091 --> 00:19:35,217
CONNOR:
HEY!

435
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:38,637
HEY, WE MADE THE TEAM!
BOTH OF US!

436
00:19:40,264 --> 00:19:43,767
KC! YOU DIDN'T HIT HIM,
DID YOU?

437
00:19:43,851 --> 00:19:46,645
NO, NO-NO-NO.
I TOOK AN ELBOW IN PRACTICE.

438
00:19:46,728 --> 00:19:48,522
I JUST LOVE BASKETBALL.

439
00:19:48,605 --> 00:19:49,731
CLARE:
KC, WAIT!

440
00:19:50,732 --> 00:19:52,067
I'M SORRY.

441
00:19:53,485 --> 00:19:56,989
YOU ARE A GOOD GUY.
AND I KNOW THAT.

442
00:19:59,616 --> 00:20:03,078
DO YOU WANNA GO CELEBRATE
MAKING THE TEAM?

443
00:20:03,161 --> 00:20:07,457
THANKS, BUT I PROBABLY
SHOULD GET RIGHT HOME.

444
00:20:12,713 --> 00:20:14,423
KICKED OUT OF REZ.

445
00:20:14,506 --> 00:20:16,216
ARE YOU SURE ABOUT THIS?

446
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:18,385
I CAN GO BACK TO VICKIE
AND COME CLEAN.

447
00:20:18,468 --> 00:20:20,429
I'M THE REASON
YOU GOT CAUGHT.

448
00:20:20,512 --> 00:20:22,389
THEY FOUND THE DRUGS ON ME.

449
00:20:22,472 --> 00:20:24,391
ZERO TOLERANCE.
WE'D BOTH GET KICKED OUT.

450
00:20:24,474 --> 00:20:27,060
BESIDES, YOU AND YOUR GIRLS
BELONG TOGETHER.

451
00:20:27,144 --> 00:20:28,353
YEAH...

452
00:20:28,437 --> 00:20:30,439
IF THEY EVER FORGIVE ME.

453
00:20:31,481 --> 00:20:32,482
HEY.

454
00:20:35,152 --> 00:20:36,653
DO YOU FORGIVE ME?

455
00:20:37,487 --> 00:20:38,655
(HEAVY EXHALE)

456
00:20:41,742 --> 00:20:43,243
ON THE BRIGHT SIDE?

457
00:20:43,327 --> 00:20:46,455
YOU CAN EXPLORE REZ LIFE
WITHOUT BEING MY APPENDAGE.

458
00:20:46,538 --> 00:20:48,749
THIS ISN'T HOW I WANTED THAT
TO HAPPEN.

459
00:20:48,832 --> 00:20:49,833
YEAH...

460
00:20:53,337 --> 00:20:54,421
