00:14:15,022 --> 00:14:17,274
MAYBE ONE DAY
A POTATO FIELD

353
00:14:17,357 --> 00:14:19,651
COULD BE A MAJOR SOURCE
OF ELECTRICITY.

354
00:14:19,735 --> 00:14:21,028
EXCITING STUFF!

355
00:14:22,029 --> 00:14:25,365
ALL RIGHT, MR. STONE.
MR. STAVROS.

356
00:14:28,869 --> 00:14:30,746
YOU'VE GOT ABOUT A MINUTE
'TIL THE BELL.

357
00:14:30,829 --> 00:14:32,789
SO GET TO THE GOOD STUFF.

358
00:14:32,873 --> 00:14:34,208
ALL RIGHT.

359
00:14:34,833 --> 00:14:38,128
UH, THE PICKLE IS INFUSED
WITH SODIUM-CHLORIDE,

360
00:14:38,212 --> 00:14:40,631
SO WHEN THE ELECTRICITY
ARCS ACROSS THE PICKLE,

361
00:14:40,714 --> 00:14:43,425
IT EXCITES THE SODIUM IONS.

362
00:14:44,051 --> 00:14:46,887
WHEN THE ELECTRONS FALL BACK
INTO A STABLE ORBITAL,

363
00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:49,765
THE SODIUM EMITS
A YELLOW LIGHT...

364
00:14:49,848 --> 00:14:50,349
AND...

365
00:14:51,475 --> 00:14:52,893
THE PICKLE GLOWS.

366
00:14:54,186 --> 00:14:56,855
DEREK:
HA! RILEY MADE PETER'S
PICKLE GLOW.

367
00:14:56,939 --> 00:14:58,357
CLASS:
(LAUGHING)

368
00:14:59,441 --> 00:15:00,442
(BELL RINGS)

369
00:15:04,571 --> 00:15:05,864
BINCE:
TOMORROW? MORE...

370
00:15:05,948 --> 00:15:07,366
PETER:
DUDE...

371
00:15:07,449 --> 00:15:09,117
MAYBE WE SHOULD TALK.

372
00:15:09,201 --> 00:15:10,744
I GOT NOTHING
TO SAY TO YOU.

373
00:15:16,583 --> 00:15:19,336
SHEP:
NOW, THERE'S NO SCHOOL POLICY
TO COVER THIS ONE,

374
00:15:19,419 --> 00:15:20,587
SO THE GOOD NEWS?

375
00:15:20,671 --> 00:15:24,132
WE CAN ALL PUT THIS INCIDENT
BEHIND US.

376
00:15:24,216 --> 00:15:26,218
MY DAUGHTER GETS HER HANDS
ON THIS FILTH

377
00:15:26,301 --> 00:15:28,804
AND WE'RE SUPPOSED
TO PUT IT BEHIND US?

378
00:15:28,887 --> 00:15:29,847
I WANNA KNOW WHAT STUDENTS

379
00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:31,682
BRING SOMETHING LIKE THIS
TO SCHOOL!

380
00:15:31,765 --> 00:15:33,851
IT'S NOT YOURS?

381
00:15:33,934 --> 00:15:35,727
(AWKWARD STAMMER)
OF COURSE IT'S...
NOT MINE!

382
00:15:35,811 --> 00:15:37,229
OH, FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE!

383
00:15:46,029 --> 00:15:47,030
I UM...

384
00:15:48,282 --> 00:15:51,118
I BOUGHT IT.
IT'S MINE.

385
00:15:52,119 --> 00:15:56,290
SOUNDS LIKE YOU TWO
HAVE A LOT TO TALK ABOUT.

386
00:16:01,795 --> 00:16:02,796
LET'S GO.

387
00:16:11,638 --> 00:16:12,723
MOM, WHY WON'T YOU
LOOK AT ME?

388
00:16:12,806 --> 00:16:16,226
I DON'T WANNA
DISCUSS THIS NOW.

389
00:16:16,310 --> 00:16:17,311
I'M SORRY.

390
00:16:18,937 --> 00:16:20,647
YOU'RE NOT HAVING SEX,
ARE YOU?

391
00:16:20,731 --> 00:16:21,732
OF COURSE NOT.

392
00:16:21,815 --> 00:16:22,774
THEN WHY WOULD YOU
BE INTERESTED

393
00:16:22,858 --> 00:16:24,318
IN A THING LIKE THAT?

394
00:16:24,401 --> 00:16:26,403
I BARELY KNOW WHAT IT'S FOR,

395
00:16:26,486 --> 00:16:28,780
BUT EVERYONE AT SCHOOL DOES.

396
00:16:28,864 --> 00:16:32,367
I AM TIRED OF BEING
THE ODD ONE OUT.

397
00:16:35,537 --> 00:16:37,164
TIME FOR YOU
TO GO BACK TO CLASS.

398
00:16:50,093 --> 00:16:51,428
(HUM OF CHATTER)

399
00:16:54,765 --> 00:16:57,434
PETER:
SO YOU'RE GOOD WITH BEING
MORE OFFICIAL NOW?

400
00:16:57,518 --> 00:16:59,603
MIA:
SURE. IF YOU'RE NOT GONNA
CHANGE YOUR MIND AGAIN.

401
00:16:59,686 --> 00:17:00,687
I'M NOT.

402
00:17:00,771 --> 00:17:02,523
AND IF YOUR BOYFRIEND
DOESN'T OBJECT...

403
00:17:02,606 --> 00:17:03,607
UGH!

404
00:17:04,858 --> 00:17:06,109
WHAT?

405
00:17:06,193 --> 00:17:07,778
I'M SORRY,
I WAS JUST KIDDING.

406
00:17:07,861 --> 00:17:10,405
I KNOW,
IT'S JUST...

407
00:17:10,489 --> 00:17:12,824
RILEY KINDA KISSED ME.

408
00:17:14,701 --> 00:17:17,162
WAIT, FOOTBALL RILEY?
LIKE...

409
00:17:17,246 --> 00:17:18,622
ON THE LIPS?

410
00:17:18,705 --> 00:17:19,706
YEAH.

411
00:17:20,707 --> 00:17:22,584
HAVE YOU TALKED
TO HIM SINCE?

412
00:17:22,668 --> 00:17:23,961
NO, AND I KEEP WONDERING

413
00:17:24,044 --> 00:17:26,922
WHAT I DID
TO LEAD HIM ON.

414
00:17:27,005 --> 00:17:30,092
MAYBE IT'S NOT ABOUT YOU,
MAYBE IT'S ABOUT RILEY.

415
00:17:30,175 --> 00:17:31,593
WHAT ABOUT HIM?

416
00:17:31,677 --> 00:17:34,304
YOU LIKED BEING HIS FRIEND,
RIGHT?

417
00:17:34,388 --> 00:17:36,557
THAT SHOULDN'T CHANGE
BECAUSE HE'S GAY.

418
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,642
MAYBE HE NEEDS YOU
TO BE A FRIEND.

419
00:17:38,725 --> 00:17:39,726
MM.

420
00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:42,271
I GUESS.

421
00:17:44,565 --> 00:17:48,360
SO, IF WE'RE OFFICIAL,
I GUESS PDA IS OKAY?

422
00:17:48,443 --> 00:17:49,945
(CHUCKLES)

423
00:17:59,329 --> 00:18:00,914
(KNOCK ON THE DOOR)

424
00:18:02,708 --> 00:18:05,752
YOU'RE NOT A BAD PERSON,
CLARE.

425
00:18:12,759 --> 00:18:15,596
I'M SORRY
IF I OVERREACTED.

426
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:18,432
AFTER WHAT HAPPENED
TO DARCY,

427
00:18:18,515 --> 00:18:21,185
(SIGHS)
I WORRY ABOUT YOU GIRLS.

428
00:18:22,186 --> 00:18:25,856
BUT YOU'RE NOT PROTECTING ME
BY NOT TALKING ABOUT IT.

429
00:18:25,939 --> 00:18:31,111
GUESS I NEVER EXPECTED YOU
TO BE INTERESTED IN SEX TOYS.

430
00:18:32,279 --> 00:18:34,448
BUT I'M, I'M NOT.
I JUST...

431
00:18:35,449 --> 00:18:37,451
NOT IN USING THEM.

432
00:18:39,119 --> 00:18:41,538
BUT I AM CURIOUS
ABOUT OTHER THINGS.

433
00:18:43,582 --> 00:18:44,583
OKAY.

434
00:18:45,626 --> 00:18:48,337
THEN LET'S TALK ABOUT THEM.

435
00:19:01,308 --> 00:19:03,477
HEY, MAN,
IT'S COOL.

436
00:19:04,603 --> 00:19:06,063
THE THING THE OTHER DAY,
IT'S COOL.

437
00:19:07,064 --> 00:19:08,690
I MEAN, I'M NOT INTO YOU
LIKE THAT,

438
00:19:08,774 --> 00:19:09,691
BUT, YOU KNOW,

439
00:19:09,775 --> 00:19:11,985
I LIKE HANGING OUT WITH YOU,
SO...

440
00:19:12,069 --> 00:19:15,322
IF YOU'RE GAY,
IT'S COOL WITH ME.

441
00:19:15,405 --> 00:19:18,242
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

442
00:19:18,325 --> 00:19:21,161
AT MY PLACE?
THE KISS?

443
00:19:22,663 --> 00:19:24,998
NOTHING HAPPENED, MAN.
I'M STRAIGHT.

444
00:19:26,875 --> 00:19:28,252
MAYBE YOU SHOULD TALK
TO SOMEONE.

445
00:19:28,335 --> 00:19:30,754
MY MOM WAS SAYING...
I TOLD YOU!

446
00:19:30,838 --> 00:19:32,965
NOTHING HAPPENED!

447
00:19:33,048 --> 00:19:34,466
GOT IT?!
(PUNCHES LOCKER)

448
00:19:40,722 --> 00:19:42,224
(FLABBERGASTED EXHALE)

449
00:19:46,562 --> 00:19:47,312
GUESS WHAT?!

450
00:19:47,396 --> 00:19:51,066
THERE'S A POSTING ABOUT YOU
ON THE ANTI-GRAPEVINE.

451
00:19:51,149 --> 00:19:53,110
HOW'D IT GO
WITH THE PARENTAL UNIT?

452
00:19:53,193 --> 00:19:54,570
MY MOM ANSWERED
MOST OF MY QUESTIONS.

453
00:19:54,653 --> 00:19:55,737
IT WAS INFORMATIVE.

454
00:19:55,821 --> 00:19:57,072
AND AWKWARD?

455
00:19:58,073 --> 00:19:59,283
UNQUESTIONABLY.

456
00:19:59,366 --> 00:20:01,743
MY MOM WOULD NEVER TALK TO ME
ABOUT THAT STUFF.

457
00:20:01,827 --> 00:20:03,161
EVER.

458
00:20:03,245 --> 00:20:06,331
HAVE YOU REALLY NEVER,
YOU KNOW...?

459
00:20:07,332 --> 00:20:09,126
I THINK THAT'S JUST FOR ME
TO KNOW.

460
00:20:09,209 --> 00:20:10,419
IF THERE'S NOTHING WRONG
WITH DOING IT,

461
00:20:10,502 --> 00:20:13,172
THEN WHY CAN'T WE
TALK ABOUT IT?

462
00:20:13,255 --> 00:20:14,590
I DON'T KNOW.

463
00:20:14,673 --> 00:20:17,342
STARTING WITH SEX TOYS EARLY,
LITTLE EDWARDS?

464
00:20:17,426 --> 00:20:19,636
WHAT WOULD JESUS SAY?

465
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:20,804
THAT MASTURBATION IS NORMAL

466
00:20:20,888 --> 00:20:24,016
AND NO ONE SHOULD BE
EMBARRASSED ABOUT IT.

467
00:20:24,099 --> 00:20:25,392
REALLY.

468
00:20:26,393 --> 00:20:28,061
AND, IF YOU TRIED IT ONCE
IN A WHILE,

469
00:20:28,145 --> 00:20:29,855
MAYBE YOU WOULDN'T BE
SO MEAN.

470
00:20:29,938 --> 00:20:31,648
STUDENTS:
(CHUCKLING)

471
00:20:37,696 --> 00:20:39,698
ANNOUNCEMENT:
ATTENTION, STUDENTS...

472
00:20:41,617 --> 00:20:43,410
BRUCE:
GOING FOR A LITTLE JOG,
ARE YOU?

473
00:20:43,493 --> 00:20:45,287
A PRANCE THROUGH THE WOODS?

474
00:20:45,370 --> 00:20:46,288
WELL,
YEAH, I AM.

475
00:20:46,371 --> 00:20:47,206
KEEPS ME IN SHAPE
FOR FOOTBALL,

476
00:20:47,289 --> 00:20:49,499
SO I CAN MAKE UP
FOR ALL YOUR FUMBLES.

477
00:20:49,583 --> 00:20:51,001
OH, SNAP.

478
00:20:51,084 --> 00:20:52,294
(CHUCKLING)

479
00:20:52,377 --> 00:20:54,880
SO I DECIDED
TO TRYOUT.

480
00:20:56,632 --> 00:20:58,342
ANY TIPS?

481
00:20:58,425 --> 00:21:00,135
YEAH. RUN FAST.

482
00:21:01,136 --> 00:21:02,554
ALL RIGHT.

483
00:21:02,638 --> 00:21:05,224
WELL, IF YOU HEAR
ANY FOOTSTEPS BEHIND YOU,

484
00:21:05,307 --> 00:21:06,725
WATCH OUT.

485
00:21:06,808 --> 00:21:07,809
TRYOUT IF YOU WANT,

486
00:21:07,893 --> 00:21:10,354
BUT DON'T GO SNEAKING UP
ON ME IN THE WOODS,

487
00:21:10,437 --> 00:21:11,939
ALL RIGHT, FAG?

488
00:21:12,022 --> 00:21:13,565
HEY,
YOU'RE THE ONE WHO'S...

489
00:21:17,277 --> 00:21:19,530
WHO'LL BE EATING MY DUST
ANYWAY,

490
00:21:19,613 --> 00:21:21,281
SO DON'T EVEN
WORRY ABOUT IT.

491
00:21:23,325 --> 00:21:26,203
ALL RIGHT.
SEE YOU OUT THERE.
