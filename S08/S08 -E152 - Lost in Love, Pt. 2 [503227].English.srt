MM.

10
00:00:17,851 --> 00:00:19,353
AT LEAST SOMEONE
HAS A SWEETHEART.

11
00:00:21,271 --> 00:00:22,689
HAD A SWEETHEART.

12
00:00:23,982 --> 00:00:26,068

WHEN YOU DELIVER YOUR SPEECH
THIS MORNING.

17
00:00:35,536 --> 00:00:36,453
I HAVE TO FINISH IT FIRST.

18
00:00:36,537 --> 00:00:37,621
I SPENT ALL NIGHT
TRYING TO WRITE

19
00:00:37,704 --> 00:00:39,289
ABOUT BEING A GIRL
ON A GUY'S TEAM

20
00:00:39,373 --> 00:00:41,583
AND ALL I COULD THINK ABOUT
WAS A GUY.

21
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,837
SO SPINNER LIED
ABOUT POLICE COLLEGE?

22
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:46,547
YEAH, AND THEN SHOWED UP
DRUNK AT MY HOUSE

23
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:48,507

SERIOUSLY?

25
00:00:49,591 --> 00:00:52,094
I LOVE SPIN,
BUT SOMETIMES...

26
00:00:52,177 --> 00:00:54,721
SOMETIMES LOVE
JUST AIN'T ENOUGH?

00:00:55,806 --> 00:00:58,809
THERE'S MY FAVOURITE
WIDE RECEIVER.

29
00:00:58,892 --> 00:01:01,144
YOU WON'T FORGET TO MENTION ME
IN YOUR SPEECH, RIGHT?

30
00:01:01,228 --> 00:01:02,604
IF YOU'D JUST LET ME ON THE TEAM
IN THE FIRST PLACE,

31
00:01:02,688 --> 00:01:04,565
I'D HAVE NOTHING
TO TALK ABOUT.

32
00:01:04,648 --> 00:01:06,316

64
00:02:29,399 --> 00:02:32,778

70
00:02:44,957 --> 00:02:46,333
DON'T BE A BLOCKHEAD.

71
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:50,462
SOME OF US ARE STILL IN SCHOOL,
SO I GOTTA HEAD BACK.

(DEEP, PREPARATORY BREATH)

73
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:54,675
I WANTED TO PLAY FOOTBALL.

74
00:02:54,758 --> 00:02:56,510
I DIDN'T WANNA BE A HERO.

75
00:02:56,593 --> 00:02:58,971
BUT ANYONE WHO ACTIVELY PURSUES
THEIR GOALS IN LIFE

76
00:02:59,054 --> 00:03:02,057

AND YOU FIND THAT
YOU HAVE TO TAKE A STAND,

79
00:03:07,896 --> 00:03:10,732
AND PEOPLE AROUND YOU
MAKE THAT POSSIBLE.

80
00:03:10,816 --> 00:03:12,025

LET ME KNOW

81
00:03:12,109 --> 00:03:13,235

92
00:03:36,341 --> 00:03:39,303
CLARE AND I NEED A MOMENT
TO DISCUSS STRATEGY.

93
00:03:39,386 --> 00:03:40,429
THOUGHT WE WEREN'T
LETTING HORMONES

94
00:03:40,512 --> 00:03:42,222
GET IN THE WAY
OF BOT WARS?

95
00:03:42,306 --> 00:03:43,557
IT'S COMPLICATED.

96
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:44,725
I'LL SIMPLIFY:

97
00:03:44,808 --> 00:03:46,894
YOU LIKE KC.
KC LIKES YOU.

98
00:03:46,977 --> 00:03:48,270
GO TO THE DANCE WITH HIM.

99
00:03:48,353 --> 00:03:49,271
BUT CONNOR...

100
00:03:49,354 --> 00:03:51,148

(LOW HUM OF CHATTER)

102
00:03:57,529 --> 00:04:00,616
I REANALYZED
THE DANCE SITUATION

103
00:04:00,699 --> 00:04:02,075
AND...

104
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:04,244
DECIDED THAT IT WOULDN'T BE
COMPLETELY HORRIBLE

105
00:04:04,328 --> 00:04:05,662
TO GO WITH YOU.

106
00:04:06,663 --> 00:04:10,667
YOU'RE ASSUMING
I STILL WANNA GO WITH YOU.

107
00:04:13,003 --> 00:04:14,254
(HALF LAUGHS)

108
00:04:14,338 --> 00:04:15,255
YOU'RE SO...

109
00:04:15,339 --> 00:04:16,465
CHARMING?

110
00:04:21,178 --> 00:04:23,764
JOHNNY DIMARCO
IS INTO ROBOTS?

111
00:04:23,847 --> 00:04:25,933
I HAVE A BROTHER
IN THE COMPETITION.

112
00:04:26,016 --> 00:04:27,017
SO YOU HAVE A NINER BROTHER

113
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:29,186
YOU'RE NOT EMBARRASSED
TO BE SEEN WITH?

114
00:04:31,355 --> 00:04:32,606
IT'S JUST...

115
00:04:32,689 --> 00:04:35,692
IT'S JUST WEIRD
TO LIKE A NINER.

116
00:04:36,693 --> 00:04:38,278
YOU LIKE ME?
HEH.

117
00:04:38,362 --> 00:04:39,780
ENOUGH TO GO
TO THE DANCE?

118
00:04:39,863 --> 00:04:41,990
I DON'T DO DANCES,

119
00:04:42,074 --> 00:04:44,868
AND I ESPECIALLY DON'T DO THEM
WITH THE NINERS.

120
00:04:44,952 --> 00:04:47,246
WELL, I'M GOING
AND I'M GONNA LOOK HOT.

121
00:04:47,329 --> 00:04:49,122
SO IF YOU SKIP OUT?

122
00:04:49,206 --> 00:04:50,541
YOUR LOSS.

FOR A FIRST DATE.

126
00:05:03,595 --> 00:05:04,930
NEXT TO A ZOMBIE
OR A WEREWOLF,

127
00:05:05,013 --> 00:05:07,015
I'M BOUND
TO LOOK GOOD.

128
00:05:08,225 --> 00:05:09,226

133
00:05:26,743 --> 00:05:27,703
WELL...

134
00:05:27,786 --> 00:05:30,581
THERE'S A COUCH
IN THE COMMON ROOM.

135
00:05:30,664 --> 00:05:32,624
OF COURSE,
IT WOULD BE RUDE

136
00:05:32,708 --> 00:05:34,710
TO KICK YOU OUT
OF YOUR OWN ROOM.

137

143
00:05:53,228 --> 00:05:54,563

I WOULDN'T BE HERE TODAY,

145
00:05:57,816 --> 00:06:01,278
