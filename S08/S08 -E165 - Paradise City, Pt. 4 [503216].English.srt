1
00:00:06,298 --> 00:00:08,258
I CAN'T BELIEVE
THE BUS WAS STOLEN.

2
00:00:08,342 --> 00:00:10,177
I HAD THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS
OF DESIGNER CLOTHES

3
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:11,220
IN THOSE BAGS.

4
00:00:11,303 --> 00:00:14,014
PETER:
YEAH, THOSE WOULD COME IN HANDY
ON A ROAD TRIP.

5
00:00:14,097 --> 00:00:16,016
MY STICKERS...

6
00:00:16,099 --> 00:00:17,476
ALL GONE.

7
00:00:17,559 --> 00:00:18,852
JAY:
WE'LL CHECK INTO A MOTEL
FOR THE NIGHT

8
00:00:18,936 --> 00:00:20,103
AND WE'LL FIGURE OUT
WHAT TO DO.

9
00:00:20,187 --> 00:00:21,730
(CELL PHONE RINGS)

10
00:00:21,813 --> 00:00:22,814
HELLO?

11
00:00:24,274 --> 00:00:26,193
OH, HI.

12
00:00:26,276 --> 00:00:28,445
YEAH, WE'RE CLOSE.
WE JUST RAN INTO A GLITCH.

13
00:00:31,823 --> 00:00:33,116
YOU'RE KIDDING!

14
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,369
WELL...
WELL, THAT'S GREAT!

15
00:00:35,452 --> 00:00:36,870
I'M NOT REALLY SURE
WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW,

16
00:00:36,954 --> 00:00:40,040
BUT DON'T WORRY,
I CAN MAKE MY OWN WAY THERE.

17
00:00:40,123 --> 00:00:43,377
THANKS. I PROMISE YOU,
I WON'T LET YOU DOWN THIS TIME.

18
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:45,170
OKAY.

19
00:00:45,254 --> 00:00:46,713
WE GOTTA GO!

20
00:00:46,797 --> 00:00:48,590
PETER:
THE BUS IS GONE,
REMEMBER?

21
00:00:48,674 --> 00:00:50,008
MANNY:
YEAH, WELL,
PAIGE IS OFF THE MOVIE.

22
00:00:50,092 --> 00:00:51,343
THAT WAS MEWES;
HE FIRED HER

23
00:00:51,426 --> 00:00:52,553
AND HE WANTS ME
TO PLAY TRIXIE!

24
00:00:52,636 --> 00:00:55,639
THAT'S GREAT, BOO.
BUT BE REASONABLE.

25
00:00:55,722 --> 00:00:57,683
YOU'RE GONNA WALK
ALL THE WAY TO HOLLYWOOD?

26
00:00:57,766 --> 00:00:59,393

00:01:49,067 --> 00:01:52,154
AND MANNY'S LOST SOMEWHERE.
WHAT IF SHE DOESN'T MAKE IT?

44
00:01:52,237 --> 00:01:54,698
YOU GOTTA FIND A TRIXIE
THAT WORKS FOR YOU, OKAY?

45
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:56,742
RIGHT IN HERE,
AND YOU KNOW WHO THAT IS.

46
00:01:56,825 --> 00:01:58,452
I THINK YOU SHOULD
FOLLOW YOUR HEART.

47
00:01:58,535 --> 00:02:00,579
I DON'T THINK YOU SHOULD
SELL OUT THIS QUICKLY.

48
00:02:00,662 --> 00:02:02,623
TOOK ME YEARS, DUDE,
YEARS.

49
00:02:02,706 --> 00:02:04,374
THAT'S TRUE.
THANKS, SIR.

50
00:02:04,458 --> 00:02:05,918
KEVIN:
YEAH.

51
00:02:06,001 --> 00:02:07,211
ROBBIE:
PAIGE TOLD ME WHAT HAPPENED.

52
00:02:07,294 --> 00:02:08,962
NOW LET'S NOT OVERREACT.

53
00:02:09,046 --> 00:02:12,007
YOU INSISTED I USE HER,
AND I TRIED.

54
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:14,009
BUT NOT ONLY
IS SHE A BAD ACTRESS,

55
00:02:14,092 --> 00:02:15,969
SHE HAS A BAD ATTITUDE.

56
00:02:16,053 --> 00:02:17,179
COME ON.
WORK WITH ME HERE.

57
00:02:17,262 --> 00:02:19,431
PAIGE IS PREPARED
TO ACCEPT AN APOLOGY.

58
00:02:19,515 --> 00:02:20,265
YOU NEED ME.

59
00:02:20,349 --> 00:02:22,392
ROBBIE:
THIS LITTLE GIRL
IS CREATING SOME GOOD BUZZ.

60
00:02:22,476 --> 00:02:23,685
AND DON'T FORGET...

61
00:02:23,769 --> 00:02:25,646
WE OPTIONED YOUR STORY.

62
00:02:25,729 --> 00:02:27,981
THE STUDIO OWNS
"MEWESICAL HIGH."

63
00:02:28,065 --> 00:02:30,400
LOOK, I'M STILL DIRECTOR
AND I'M RECASTING.

64
00:02:30,484 --> 00:02:32,361
I WANT MANNY SANTOS.

65
00:02:33,278 --> 00:02:35,614
MANNY SANTOS?!
PLEASE!
YOU'RE KIDDING!

66
00:02:35,697 --> 00:02:36,990
THAT GIRL WITH
THE TERRIBLE AUDITION TAPE?

67
00:02:37,074 --> 00:02:39,826
YOU CAN'T HAVE MANNY.
YOU CAN HAVE PAIGE.

68
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:41,662
SHE'S NOT MY TRIXIE.

69
00:02:41,745 --> 00:02:42,996
THEN YOU'RE FIRED.

70
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:45,123
FIRED? I QUIT!

71
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:51,046
DON'T WORRY,
HE DOESN'T MEAN IT.

72
00:02:51,129 --> 00:02:53,006
KEVIN:
OH, I THINK HE DOES, HON.

73
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:54,508
I THINK HE DOES.

74
00:02:56,927 --> 00:02:57,928
(CROWS CAW)

75
00:03:00,597 --> 00:03:02,516
SO HOW LONG ARE YOU
GONNA STAY MAD AT ME?

76
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:04,768
UNTIL WE GET TO HOLLYWOOD.

77
00:03:06,436 --> 00:03:08,981
YOU KNOW, WE'RE NOT GONNA WALK
ALL THE WAY THERE IN TIME!

78
00:03:09,064 --> 00:03:10,274
ARE YOU INSANE?

79
00:03:10,357 --> 00:03:13,694
YES, I'M INSANE!
WITH RAGE, TOWARDS YOU!

80
00:03:13,777 --> 00:03:15,821
I HAVE TO GET THAT PART.

81
00:03:15,904 --> 00:03:17,364
AND HOW COULD
I POSSIBLY KNOW

82
00:03:17,447 --> 00:03:19,825
THAT SOMEONE WOULD WANNA
STEAL A SCHOOL BUS?

83
00:03:19,908 --> 00:03:21,201
HOW COULD YOU POSSIBLY
NOT KNOW

84
00:03:21,285 --> 00:03:22,703
THAT LEAVING THE KEYS
IN THE IGNITION

85
00:03:22,786 --> 00:03:24,204
WAS A STUPID IDEA!

86
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:25,205
PETER:
GUYS!

87
00:03:25,289 --> 00:03:26,206
JAY AND MANNY:
WHAT?!

88
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:27,291
LOOK OVER THERE!

89
00:03:41,638 --> 00:03:44,016
I HAVE A FIX
FOR OUR PETITE PROBLEME;

90
00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:45,934
A LIST OF REALLY GOOD
DIRECTORS.

91
00:03:46,018 --> 00:03:50,439
ANY OF THEM WOULD BE PERFECT
FOR "MEWESICAL HIGH."

92
00:03:50,522 --> 00:03:54,610
HOW CAN WE POSSIBLY MAKE
A MOVIE ABOUT MEWES' LIFE

93
00:03:54,693 --> 00:03:56,695
WITHOUT MEWEWS?

94
00:03:56,778 --> 00:04:00,324
BUT...
YOU SAID HE NEEDED ME.

95
00:04:00,407 --> 00:04:02,784
YOU FIRED HIM.
IT WAS A BLUFF!

96
00:04:02,868 --> 00:04:03,952
I THOUGHT HE'D CAVE

97
00:04:04,036 --> 00:04:05,579
AND WE'D JUST MAKE
THE MOVIE.

98
00:04:05,662 --> 00:04:07,748
BUT YOU PISSED HIM OFF,

99
00:04:07,831 --> 00:04:10,709
AND NOW YOU'VE GOTTEN
YOURSELF A DIVA REP.

100
00:04:10,792 --> 00:04:12,002
WHAT?!

101
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:14,588
YOU DIDN'T SEE PEREZ' BLOG
TODAY?

102
00:04:14,671 --> 00:04:17,633
NO ONE WILL WORK
WITH YOU NOW.

103
00:04:18,967 --> 00:04:20,969
I THOUGHT PEREZ LOVED ME?

104
00:04:21,053 --> 00:04:24,765
THINGS CHANGE FAST
AROUND HERE.

105
00:04:24,848 --> 00:04:27,226
YOU CAN KEEP THE HOUSE
FOR ONE MORE WEEK.

106
00:04:27,309 --> 00:04:29,019
ENJOY THE POOL.

107
00:04:32,064 --> 00:04:35,234
(LIGHTS CLICK OFF)

108
00:04:46,078 --> 00:04:48,121
CRAIG:
HEY, I'LL STAY WITH ELLIE.

109
00:04:48,205 --> 00:04:49,957
YOU BETTER GET GOING.

110
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:52,376
THANKS.
SEE YA.

111
00:05:08,976 --> 00:05:10,978
(EXHALES)

112
00:05:11,061 --> 00:05:14,565
I'M SORRY FOR ACTING LIKE
SUCH AN IDIOT LAST NIGHT.

113
00:05:14,648 --> 00:05:17,568
SLEEP'S PROBABLY THE BEST THING
RIGHT NOW.

114
00:05:20,112 --> 00:05:22,865
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT I WAS THINKING.

115
00:05:25,909 --> 00:05:27,035
I WASN'T...
(HALF LAUGHS)

116
00:05:27,119 --> 00:05:28,704
TRYING TO KILL MYSELF.

117
00:05:28,787 --> 00:05:30,455
CRAIG:
I KNOW.

118
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:37,546
MARCO, UM...

119
00:05:37,629 --> 00:05:39,798
HE TOLD ME ABOUT YOUR DAD.

120
00:05:41,758 --> 00:05:43,427
I SHOULD PROBABLY GO SEE HIM,
RIGHT?

121
00:05:44,511 --> 00:05:45,679
WHEN YOU'RE READY.

122
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:47,806
IT'S JUST...

123
00:05:47,890 --> 00:05:51,018
I'VE ALWAYS BEEN ABLE
TO FIX THINGS.

124
00:05:51,101 --> 00:05:53,228
YOU KNOW, LIKE...

125
00:05:53,312 --> 00:05:55,105
MY MOM.
(TEARY BREATH)

126
00:05:56,106 --> 00:05:57,149
AND THEN YOU.

127
00:05:59,693 --> 00:06:02,362
MY DAD WATCHED
HIS SOLDIERS DIE.

128
00:06:04,656 --> 00:06:06,575
HE'S GOT POST TRAUMATIC
STRESS DISORDER

129
00:06:06,658 --> 00:06:09,286
AND...
I KNOW I CAN'T FIX THAT.

130
00:06:11,121 --> 00:06:12,956
NO ONE EXPECTS YOU TO.

131
00:06:16,752 --> 00:06:19,755
CRAIG:
LOOK, AFTER YOU SLEEP,
I'LL MAKE YOU SOME EGGS.

132
00:06:19,838 --> 00:06:22,132
IF YOU SURVIVE THAT,

133
00:06:22,216 --> 00:06:24,551
WE'LL TAKE THE NEXT STEP.
OKAY?

134
00:06:29,973 --> 00:06:30,974
OKAY.

135
00:06:41,902 --> 00:06:43,946
(HUM OF CHATTER)

136
00:06:57,543 --> 00:06:59,837
YOU NEED TO PRINT
A RETRACTION.

137
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,964
DO I KNOW YOU?
PAIGE MICHALCHUK.

138
00:07:02,047 --> 00:07:03,799
YOU WROTE THAT "MEWESICAL HIGH"
GOT CANCELLED

139
00:07:03,882 --> 00:07:05,843
BECAUSE I WAS BEING A DIVA.

140
00:07:05,926 --> 00:07:07,427
RIGHT, I REMEMBER NOW.

141
00:07:07,511 --> 00:07:10,180
UNKNOWN GOES BACK
TO BEING UNKNOWN.

142
00:07:10,264 --> 00:07:12,266
NO.
NO-NO-NO, PLEASE.

143
00:07:12,349 --> 00:07:14,810
YOU HAVE TO HELP ME!
NO ONE WILL RETURN MY CALLS.

144
00:07:14,893 --> 00:07:17,771
PEREZ:
THEN DO SOMETHING INTERESTING.
MAYBE THEN I'LL WRITE ABOUT IT.

145
00:07:17,855 --> 00:07:18,689
AROUND HERE,

146
00:07:18,772 --> 00:07:21,400
YOU'RE ONLY AS HOT
AS YOUR LATEST SCANDAL.

147
00:07:25,863 --> 00:07:30,617
HERE. AN INVITE TO
THE PREMIERE OF PINK RIFLE.

148
00:07:30,701 --> 00:07:32,244

WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

154
00:07:52,973 --> 00:07:55,142
AN OLD TRICK
THAT MY MOM TAUGHT ME.

155
00:07:55,225 --> 00:07:57,644
OUR CAR WAS ALWAYS
BREAKING DOWN.

156
00:07:57,728 --> 00:08:00,105
