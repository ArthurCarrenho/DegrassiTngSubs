HE'S YOUR FRIEND,

181
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:41,420
I GET THAT,

182
00:07:41,503 --> 00:07:44,715
BUT YOU CAN'T DEFEND HIM
PUSHING ALLI.

183
00:07:44,798 --> 00:07:46,758
HAVE EVER HAD YOUR FACE
PUSHED INTO A PUDDLE OF MUD

184
00:07:46,842 --> 00:07:50,345
WHILE PEOPLE STOOD AROUND
AND LAUGHED?

185
00:07:51,346 --> 00:07:53,223
THEN YOU WOULDN'T
UNDERSTAND.

186
00:07:53,307 --> 00:07:55,851
CONNOR:
I AM NOT APOLOGIZING TO ALLI!

187
00:07:55,934 --> 00:07:58,061
I TOLD HER
TO GET OUT OF MY WAY!

188
00:07:59,730 --> 00:08:00,731
(DOORS OPEN)

189
00:08:02,274 --> 00:08:03,567
CONNOR'S A GOOD KID.
OKAY?

190
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:04,902
IF WE COULD JUST WAIT
FOR THE TEST RESULTS.

191
00:08:04,985 --> 00:08:07,154
MMM...
I'D STILL EXPEL HIM.

192
00:08:07,237 --> 00:08:08,822
I MEAN,
THE KID'S A LOOSE CANNON

193
00:08:08,906 --> 00:08:11,033
AND THIS IS NOT
HIS FIRST INCIDENT.

194
00:08:11,116 --> 00:08:14,203
I'M SORRY,
MY DECISION'S FINAL.

195
00:08:15,204 --> 00:08:16,663
(VEHICLE WHIRS BY)

196
00:08:18,457 --> 00:08:21,210
OKAY, SO,
THERE'S THIS GIRL AT SCHOOL.

197
00:08:21,293 --> 00:08:23,670
(MIMICKING FATHER)
YOU'RE GROUNDED.
FOR LIFE.

198
00:08:23,754 --> 00:08:25,088
THIS IS SERIOUS, ALLI.

199
00:08:25,172 --> 00:08:26,924
WHAT'S SERIOUS?

200
00:08:28,759 --> 00:08:30,093
UH, DAD, UH...

201
00:08:31,094 --> 00:08:35,265
THERE'S SOMETHING
I WANNA TALK TO YOU ABOUT.

202
00:08:36,725 --> 00:08:39,394
THAT DOESN'T INVOLVE ALLI.

203
00:08:41,897 --> 00:08:42,814
GO ON, SON.

204
00:08:42,898 --> 00:08:43,899
UH...

205
00:08:45,359 --> 00:08:47,152
BEFORE YOU MARRIED MOM,

206
00:08:47,236 --> 00:08:49,196
WERE YOU EVER INTERESTED
IN OTHER GIRLS?

207
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:50,197
(LAUGHS)

208
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:52,449
YOU MEAN WAS I 17 ONCE?

209
00:08:52,533 --> 00:08:53,534
YES.

210
00:08:54,701 --> 00:08:57,871
OKAY, UM, BUT YOU NEVER
DATED ANY OF THEM,

211
00:08:57,955 --> 00:08:58,872
RIGHT?

212
00:08:58,956 --> 00:09:00,582
NO PROPER GIRL
WOULD BE ALLOWED.

213
00:09:00,666 --> 00:09:01,875
IN INDIA.

214
00:09:01,959 --> 00:09:04,211
BUT IT'S DIFFERENT HERE.
I MEAN, EVERYONE DATES.

215
00:09:04,294 --> 00:09:07,881
AND THERE'S THIS GIRL
THAT I LIKE - ANYA.

216
00:09:07,965 --> 00:09:09,925
I LIKE HER A LOT.

217
00:09:16,139 --> 00:09:18,392
PLEASE SAY SOMETHING.

218
00:09:19,518 --> 00:09:21,395
WELL, IF YOU'RE SERIOUS
ABOUT THIS GIRL,

219
00:09:21,478 --> 00:09:22,980
WE SHOULD MEET HER.

220
00:09:23,063 --> 00:09:25,274
WHY DON'T YOU INVITE HER
OVER TO DINNER?

221
00:09:25,357 --> 00:09:26,984
SERIOUSLY?!

222
00:09:27,067 --> 00:09:28,068
DAD, YOU'RE THE BEST.

223
00:09:28,151 --> 00:09:29,152
(CHUCKLES)

224
00:09:31,738 --> 00:09:33,699
YOU CAN'T GO HOME.
NOT YET!

225
00:09:33,782 --> 00:09:34,950
IF I'M NOT IN GIFTED
AT DEGRASSI,

226
00:09:35,033 --> 00:09:36,535
MY PARENTS WON'T LET ME STAY.

227
00:09:36,618 --> 00:09:38,412
BUT WE'RE NOT DONE
FIGHTING THIS.

228
00:09:38,495 --> 00:09:40,497
WE HAVEN'T GONE
TO THE SCHOOL BOARD...

229
00:09:40,581 --> 00:09:41,665
OR THE MEDIA.

230
00:09:41,748 --> 00:09:43,792
YOU JUST HAVE TO APOLOGIZE
FOR PUSHING ALLI.

231
00:09:43,876 --> 00:09:45,502
SHE TOOK MY PENCIL!

232
00:09:47,713 --> 00:09:49,631
I'M A FREAK, OKAY?!

233
00:09:49,715 --> 00:09:51,425
EVERYONE THINKS SO!

234
00:09:51,508 --> 00:09:53,844
SHEP, ALLI, KC.

235
00:09:53,927 --> 00:09:55,721
EVEN MR. SIMPSON.

236
00:09:55,804 --> 00:09:58,098
THAT'S WHY HE KEEPS
TAKING ME FOR TESTS.

237
00:09:58,182 --> 00:09:59,474
TESTS?

238
00:09:59,558 --> 00:10:01,643
WHAT TYPE OF TESTS?

239
00:10:08,192 --> 00:10:10,027
ALL YOUR CLOTHES,

240
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:11,111
THEY'RE THE SAME.

241
00:10:12,654 --> 00:10:14,448
CONNOR:
YOU WEAR THE SAME THING
EVERY DAY.

242
00:10:14,531 --> 00:10:16,283
BUT I HAVE OTHER CLOTHES
AT HOME.

243
00:10:16,366 --> 00:10:18,452
YOU THINK I'M A FREAK TOO!

244
00:10:18,535 --> 00:10:19,745
GET OUT!

245
00:10:19,828 --> 00:10:21,788
GET OUT! GET OUT!

246
00:10:21,872 --> 00:10:23,498
GET OUT! NOW!

250
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:45,103
HE DIDN'T MAKE ME RUN
FOR SCHOOL PRESIDENT,

251
00:10:45,187 --> 00:10:46,271
HE JUST APPOINTED ME.

252
00:10:46,355 --> 00:10:48,398
PRETTY SURE
THAT'S NOT A GOOD THING.

253
00:10:48,482 --> 00:10:51,735
WE'LL JUST CUT AROUND
THE "APPOINTED" PART.

254
00:10:51,818 --> 00:10:55,113
CONNOR GETS EXPELLED;
CLARE GETS A NEW WARDROBE.

255
00:10:55,197 --> 00:10:56,240
LEAVE IT ALONE, ALLI.

256
00:10:57,866 --> 00:10:58,951
ARE YOU OKAY?

257
00:11:01,662 --> 00:11:03,038
CONNOR WAS JUST SO...

258
00:11:03,121 --> 00:11:04,122
WEIRD?

259
00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:08,502
I WENT OVER LAST NIGHT

260
00:11:08,585 --> 00:11:11,463
AND HE HAD SOME SORT
OF MELTDOWN.

261
00:11:11,547 --> 00:11:13,757
THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG
WITH HIM.

262

SIMPSON:
CLARE.

263
00:11:15,092 --> 00:11:17,761
CAN I SPEAK TO YOU
FOR A MOMENT?

264
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:23,225
SINCE YOU'RE HIS FRIEND,

265
00:11:23,308 --> 00:11:25,561
CONNOR WANTED ME
TO TELL YOU.

266
00:11:25,644 --> 00:11:28,564
HE'S BEEN DIAGNOSED
WITH ASPERGER'S SYNDROME.

267
00:11:28,647 --> 00:11:30,858
ASPERGER'S SYNDROME?

268
00:11:30,941 --> 00:11:32,818
IT MEANS HIS BRAIN
IS WIRED DIFFERENTLY.

269
00:11:32,901 --> 00:11:34,444
SOCIAL RULES
THAT WE ALL KNOW,

270
00:11:34,528 --> 00:11:36,363
HE HAS TO LEARN.

271
00:11:37,406 --> 00:11:38,824
BUT THERE'S SOME SORT OF CURE,
RIGHT?

272
00:11:38,907 --> 00:11:40,742
LIKE MEDICATION
OR SOMETHING?

273
00:11:40,826 --> 00:11:41,952
NO.

274
00:11:42,035 --> 00:11:45,956
BUT WITH COUNSELLING
HE CAN LIVE A NORMAL LIFE.

275
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:47,833
HE'S REALLY SCARED;

276
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:51,336
HE COULD USE A FRIEND
RIGHT NOW.

277
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:53,755

INTERPRETATION?

AND MORE IMPORTANTLY,

283
00:12:12,566 --> 00:12:14,818

INTERPRETATION BE?

MR. SIMPSON LET ME IN.

307
00:13:13,418 --> 00:13:15,838
IS THAT AN X-23 MODEL?

308
00:13:17,673 --> 00:13:18,590
YEAH,

309
00:13:18,674 --> 00:13:19,883
BUT I REPLACED
THE ELECTRIC MOTOR

310
00:13:19,967 --> 00:13:22,010
WITH A HYDRAULIC SYSTEM.

311
00:13:22,094 --> 00:13:24,513
TO GIVE IT MORE POWER.

I DIDN'T THINK YOU'D VISIT
BEFORE I LEFT.

313
00:13:35,232 --> 00:13:38,193
I GUESS I NEEDED SOME TIME
TO DIGEST YOUR NEWS.

314
00:13:41,697 --> 00:13:45,158
THEY SAY THAT EINSTEIN
MIGHT'VE HAD ASPERGERS.

315
00:13:45,242 --> 00:13:46,827
HE USED TO WEAR
THE SAME OUTFIT EVERYDAY

316
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:48,328
JUST LIKE YOU.

317
00:13:49,329 --> 00:13:51,081

I'M REALLY SMART.

318
00:13:51,164 --> 00:13:52,791
YOU ARE.

319
00:13:52,875 --> 00:13:55,460
BUT HE SAID THAT
NOT EVERYONE IS INTERESTED

320
00:13:55,544 --> 00:13:56,795
IN WHAT I'M INTERESTED IN.

321
00:13:56,879 --> 00:13:59,047
SO I HAVE TO BE CAREFUL
NOT TO BORE PEOPLE

322
00:13:59,131 --> 00:14:01,466
ABOUT ROBOTS AND MOTHS
AND STUFF.

323
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:04,303
WELL, YOU DON'T BORE ME.

324
00:14:04,386 --> 00:14:05,470
SO YOU DON'T THINK
I'M A FREAK?

325
00:14:05,554 --> 00:14:06,471
NO.

326
00:14:06,555 --> 00:14:08,682

IN THE GIFTED PROGRAM

00:14:13,312 --> 00:14:15,689
ISN'T THE BURFI ANYA MADE
DELICIOUS?

329
00:14:15,772 --> 00:14:18,609
MIGHT EVEN RIVAL

TO MEET YOU BOTH.

TO HAVE THE CHANCE

00:14:35,542 --> 00:14:38,504
MRS. BHANDARI:
NONE OF THIS SHOULD COME
AS A SURPRISE TO YOU, SAVTAJ.

339
00:14:38,587 --> 00:14:41,215
YOU LET ANYA
COME FOR DINNER.

340
00:14:41,298 --> 00:14:43,884
IT'S IMPORTANT
ANYA HEAR THE TRUTH.

341
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:45,552
NEITHER OF YOU SHOULD BE
IN A RELATIONSHIP

342
00:14:45,636 --> 00:14:47,179
THAT HAS NO FUTURE.

UM, I CAN BECOME MUSLIM.

344
00:14:48,889 --> 00:14:50,974
I'VE BEEN READING THE QUR'AN
AND EVERYTHING.

345
00:14:51,058 --> 00:14:53,268
IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT RELIGION.

346
00:14:53,352 --> 00:14:56,146
WHEN YOU LEAVE YOUR HOME,
IT'S EASY TO LOSE YOUR ROOTS.

347
00:14:56,230 --> 00:14:59,024
IT'S UP TO OUR CHILDREN
TO MAINTAIN THEM

00:14:59,107 --> 00:15:01,527
WITH INDIAN SPOUSES.

349
00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:04,154
I THOUGHT YOU SAID
YOU WERE 17 ONCE.

350
00:15:04,238 --> 00:15:05,405
MR. BHANDARI:
I'M SORRY, SAV.

351
00:15:05,489 --> 00:15:08,116
BUT YOUR MOTHER AND I ARE UNITED
ON THIS FRONT.

352
00:15:18,794 --> 00:15:20,337
I APPRECIATE YOUR HONESTY,

353
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:21,880
AND I THINK I SHOULD GO.

354
00:15:21,964 --> 00:15:23,757
ENJOY THE BURFI.

355
00:15:23,841 --> 00:15:25,717
UH...
I'LL WALK YOU OUT.

356
