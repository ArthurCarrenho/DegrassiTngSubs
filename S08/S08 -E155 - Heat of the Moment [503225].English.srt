WASN'T BAD ENOUGH.

SHOULDN'T YOU BE GOING

395
00:15:48,198 --> 00:15:50,117

410
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:14,933
I SUGGEST YOU WRITE

OH.

427
00:16:58,352 --> 00:16:59,895
WELL, I CAN'T KEEP TRACK
OF EVERYTHING.

428
00:16:59,978 --> 00:17:01,855
YEAH, KEEPING TRACK OF SOMETHING
I'VE BEEN DOING SINCE I WAS 10,

429
00:17:01,939 --> 00:17:03,899
THAT'D BE CRAZY.

430
00:17:05,567 --> 00:17:07,027

HEAD OUT.

00:17:13,450 --> 00:17:14,368
SO DON'T BE FOR ANGEL.

435
00:17:14,451 --> 00:17:16,411
NOW THAT'S NOT FAIR,

437
00:17:18,038 --> 00:17:19,373
