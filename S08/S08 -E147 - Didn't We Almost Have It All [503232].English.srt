1
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:05,547
JACKET OR NO JACKET?

2
00:00:05,631 --> 00:00:07,966
AREN'T YOU A SHOO-IN
FOR YOUR MOM'S SORORITY?

3
00:00:08,050 --> 00:00:09,134
LIBERTY:
NO JACKET.

4
00:00:09,218 --> 00:00:11,261
WELL, BEING LEGACY
DOESN'T GUARANTEE YOU A SPOT.

5
00:00:11,345 --> 00:00:12,513
THEY HAVE TO LIKE ME.

6
00:00:12,596 --> 00:00:13,180
THEY WILL.

7
00:00:13,263 --> 00:00:15,349
BUT IT SHOULDN'T BE BECAUSE
OF YOUR OUTERWEAR CHOICE.

8
00:00:15,432 --> 00:00:17,684
CUTE.
AND INCREDIBLY NAIVE.

9
00:00:17,768 --> 00:00:19,019
WOULD YOU WEAR JEANS
AND A T-SHIRT

10
00:00:19,102 --> 00:00:20,896
TO A JOB INTERVIEW?

11
00:00:20,979 --> 00:00:21,939
YEAH.

12
00:00:23,106 --> 00:00:25,108
EMMA:
REMIND ME WHY YOU EVEN WANT
TO JOIN A SORORITY?

13
00:00:25,192 --> 00:00:27,694
I MEAN, WHAT'S WRONG
WITH BEING AN INDIVIDUAL?

14
00:00:27,778 --> 00:00:29,655
IT'S ALL ABOUT CONNECTIONS.

15
00:00:29,738 --> 00:00:32,115
NOW, IS MY INQUISITION
COMPLETE?

16
00:00:32,199 --> 00:00:34,493
GOOD,
THEN WISH ME LUCK.

17
00:00:34,576 --> 00:00:35,911

THE DEAN IS PI GAMMA PI.

28
00:00:58,976 --> 00:01:01,436
SHE KEEPS HER EYES OUT
FOR POTENTIAL RECRUITS.

29
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:02,938
WE ONLY ACCEPT THE CREAM.

30
00:01:03,021 --> 00:01:04,064
IT'S YOUR CHOICE.

31
00:01:04,147 --> 00:01:05,315

WE COUNT BOTH M.P.S

52
00:02:06,251 --> 00:02:08,795
AND NOBLE PRIZE WINNERS
AS ALUMNAE.

53
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:11,256
BUT FIRST,
PLEDGING IS LIKE DATING.

54
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:13,258
GIVES A CHANCE TO SEE
IF THE RELATIONSHIP WILL WORK

55
00:02:13,342 --> 00:02:14,885
BEFORE WE COMMIT.

56
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:17,095
YOU CAN BREAK UP
WITH US TOO.

57
00:02:17,179 --> 00:02:19,306
AND GIVE UP CRAZY CONNECTIONS

58
00:02:19,389 --> 00:02:20,432

FOR HARVARD LAW.

62
00:02:25,521 --> 00:02:27,147
HARVARD LAW?

63
00:02:27,231 --> 00:02:29,358
A PI GAMMA PI RUNS ADMISSIONS.

64
00:02:29,441 --> 00:02:30,275
GET INVITED TO JOIN US

65
00:02:30,359 --> 00:02:32,819
AND THOSE CONNECTIONS
ARE GUARANTEED.

66
00:02:32,903 --> 00:02:36,532
BUT FIRST,
YOU MUST PROVE YOU BELONG.

67
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:40,285
(WHISPERS)
I SEE SOME THINGS
THAT DON'T BELONG.

68
00:02:40,369 --> 00:02:44,081
DAKOTA:
NOW LET'S GO MEET SOME ALUMNAE.

69
00:02:54,383 --> 00:02:56,218
(DIN OF CHATTER)

70
00:02:59,263 --> 00:03:00,681
HOLLY J, YOU CAN'T
JUST DECLARE YOURSELF

71
00:03:00,764 --> 00:03:02,015
STUDENT COUNCIL PRESIDENT.

72
00:03:02,099 --> 00:03:03,433
I DIDN'T.
THE SHEP DID.

73
00:03:03,517 --> 00:03:05,102
BUT IT'S UNDEMOCRATIC.

74
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:06,228
OH MY GOD, YOU'RE RIGHT.

75
00:03:06,311 --> 00:03:08,814
AND YET STRANGELY?
UNBOTHERED.

76
00:03:08,897 --> 00:03:09,857
IF YOU DON'T
GO ALL CHE ON ME,

77
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:11,817
I MIGHT MAKE YOU SECRETARY.

78
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:15,612
NOW SCOOT, I HAVE A POWER SQUAD
TO BRING INTO LINE.

79
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:20,617
CHANTAY:
(INAUDIBLE WHISPERING)

80
00:03:21,618 --> 00:03:22,786
CAN SOMEBODY PLEASE TELL ME

81
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:24,621
WHAT'S MORE IMPORTANT
THAN CITY FINALS?

82
00:03:24,705 --> 00:03:27,791
ANYA'S FINALLY
SWIPED HER V-CARD.

83
00:03:27,875 --> 00:03:29,168
SAYS WHO?
CHANTAY: EVERYONE.

84
00:03:29,251 --> 00:03:31,044
AND IT EXPLAINS
WHY SHE ISN'T AT PRACTICE.

85
00:03:31,128 --> 00:03:33,922
SHE AND SAV ARE PROBABLY
DOING IT RIGHT NOW.

86
00:03:34,006 --> 00:03:35,382
ANYA SAID SHE WAS SICK.

87
00:03:35,465 --> 00:03:37,050
CHANTAY:
PROBABLY JUST BED-RIDDEN.

88
00:03:37,134 --> 00:03:39,178
AND NOW THAT
ANYA'S DONE THE DEED,

89
00:03:39,261 --> 00:03:41,805
THE POWER SQUAD MIGHT FINALLY
BE VIRGIN-FREE.

90
00:03:41,889 --> 00:03:43,724
(SCOFFS)
NOT A CHANCE.

91
00:03:46,476 --> 00:03:47,978
UNLESS YOU'RE ONE?

92
00:03:48,896 --> 00:03:51,523
I'M THE CAPTAIN
OF THE POWER SQUAD.

93
00:03:51,607 --> 00:03:53,734
OKAY, GOSSIP'S NOT GONNA
GET US ANYWHERE.

94
00:03:53,817 --> 00:03:55,986
TOE TOUCHES, PEOPLE.

95
00:04:10,542 --> 00:04:11,627
EMMA:
HOW'S RUSH?

96
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:12,753
SPECIFICALLY,
HAVE YOU FOUND ME

97
00:04:12,836 --> 00:04:14,880
A CUTE SORORITY GIRL?

98
00:04:14,963 --> 00:04:18,425
NO, BUT I MET TWO M.P.S
AND A SUPREME COURT JUDGE.

99
00:04:18,509 --> 00:04:19,009
ALL ALUMNAE.

100
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:21,386
IMAGINE ME.
IN SUPREME COURT!

101
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:22,387
DON'T GET TOO EXCITED.

102
00:04:22,471 --> 00:04:25,766
I HEAR PI GAMMA PI
IS VERY SELECTIVE.

103
00:04:25,849 --> 00:04:28,936
YOU DON'T THINK
I HAVE WHAT IT TAKES?

104
00:04:29,478 --> 00:04:30,729
HEY GIRL.

105
00:04:30,812 --> 00:04:34,274
COME ON, PI GAMMA PI
SITS AT THE FRONT.

106
00:04:34,358 --> 00:04:35,567
WAIT, YOU'RE DITCHING US?

107
00:04:35,651 --> 00:04:36,902
FOR THEM?

108
00:04:37,444 --> 00:04:40,113
JUST UNTIL I MAKE THE CUT.

109
00:04:46,495 --> 00:04:47,996
LIBERTY, THIS IS JULIE.

110
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:50,207
THOUGHT YOU TWO WOULD HAVE
A LOT IN COMMON.

111
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:52,876
ARE YOU A THREE-SPORT ATHLETE
FROM THE WEST COAST?

112
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,962
STAR ATHLETE.
STAR SCHOLAR.

113
00:04:55,045 --> 00:04:57,339
YOU TWO MAKE ME FEEL
LIKE A MAJOR SLACKER.

114
00:04:57,422 --> 00:05:00,467
DAKOTA:
OKAY, EVERYONE,
GRAB A SEAT ON THE FLOOR.

115
00:05:00,551 --> 00:05:01,218
COME ON.

116
00:05:02,177 --> 00:05:03,470
SO TODAY'S PLAN

117
00:05:03,554 --> 00:05:05,389
IS TO GET MORE FAMILIAR
WITH EACH OTHER

118
00:05:05,472 --> 00:05:09,476
BY SHARING THE TOUGHEST TIME
OF YOUR LIFE.

119
00:05:10,018 --> 00:05:11,019
BECCA.

120
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,355
YOU'RE UP FISRT.

121
00:05:13,856 --> 00:05:14,231
OKAY.

122
00:05:15,274 --> 00:05:17,109
UM, IT WAS GRADE NINE.

123
00:05:17,943 --> 00:05:20,737
HE HAD SEEMED
LIKE A REALLY NICE GUY.

124
00:05:20,821 --> 00:05:22,614
UNTIL HE GAVE ME A MULLET.

125
00:05:22,698 --> 00:05:24,575
NEVER WENT TO THAT
HAIRDRESSER AGAIN.

126
00:05:24,658 --> 00:05:25,826
(LAUGHS)

127
00:05:26,743 --> 00:05:28,412
I'VE HAD A PRETTY CHARMED LIFE.

128
00:05:28,495 --> 00:05:31,206
DAKOTA:
WELL, WE CAN'T HOLD THAT
AGAINST YOU.

129
00:05:31,290 --> 00:05:33,375
OKAY, LIBERTY,
YOUR TURN.

130
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:39,673
WELL, UH, THE TOUGHEST TIME
IN MY LIFE WOULD BE...

131
00:05:39,756 --> 00:05:43,385
WHEN I HAD TO GIVE MY BABY
UP FOR ADOPTION.

132
00:05:45,929 --> 00:05:47,764
OH MY GOD, UM...

133
00:05:48,307 --> 00:05:51,185
WAS THE FATHER SUPPORTIVE?

134
00:05:51,268 --> 00:05:51,935
HE DIED.

135
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:54,521
HE WAS STABBED.

136
00:05:56,899 --> 00:05:58,525
I'M SO SORRY.

137
00:05:58,609 --> 00:06:00,152
IN A GANG FIGHT?

138
00:06:00,235 --> 00:06:01,528
NOT EXACTLY.

139
00:06:01,612 --> 00:06:02,529
DAKOTA:
IT'S AMAZING,

140
00:06:02,613 --> 00:06:05,157
YOU GREW UP LIKE THAT
AND END UP HERE.

141
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,867
YOU DIDN'T HAVE
THE PRIVILEGES WE DID,

142
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:09,036
BUT YOU OVERCAME THE ODDS.

143
00:06:09,119 --> 00:06:10,746
IT WOULD BE GREAT TO HAVE
SOMEONE WITH YOUR PERSPECTIVE

144
00:06:10,829 --> 00:06:12,623
IN PI GAMMA PI.

145
00:06:12,706 --> 00:06:15,501
WE WOULD BE LUCKY
TO HAVE YOU.

146
00:06:15,584 --> 00:06:17,753
(APPLAUSE OF COMMENDATION)

147
00:06:25,594 --> 00:06:27,930
MS. KWAN:
GATHER YE ROSEBUDS
WHILE YE MAY,

148
00:06:28,013 --> 00:06:30,098
OLD TIME'S STILL A-FLYING.

149
00:06:30,182 --> 00:06:32,851
AND THIS SAME FLOWER
THAT SMILES TODAY

150
00:06:32,935 --> 00:06:35,437
TOMORROW WILL BE DYING.

151
00:06:35,521 --> 00:06:39,358
BLUE? WHAT IS ROBERT HERRICK
SAYING IN THIS POEM?

152
00:06:39,441 --> 00:06:42,194
TOO MANY FLOWERS.
NOT ENOUGH TIME.

153
00:06:42,277 --> 00:06:44,238
ACCORDING TO
THE ANTI-GRAPEVINE,

154
00:06:44,321 --> 00:06:45,405
HE'S HAD MANY FLOWERS.

155
00:06:45,489 --> 00:06:48,700
AND THEY'VE ALL BEEN
VERY HAPPY AFTERWARDS.

156
00:06:48,784 --> 00:06:51,245
MS. KWAN:
CHANTAY, SOMETHING YOU'D LIKE
TO SHARE WITH THE CLASS?

157
00:06:51,328 --> 00:06:52,829
CHANTAY:
NO, MISS KWAN.

158
00:06:52,913 --> 00:06:54,414
MS. KWAN:
THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT.

159
00:06:54,498 --> 00:06:55,999
SINCE YOU HAVE SO MUCH TO SAY,

160
00:06:56,083 --> 00:06:57,084
WHY DON'T YOU ILLUMINATE US

161
00:06:57,167 --> 00:06:59,169
WITH YOUR INTERPRETATION
OF THE POEM.

162
00:06:59,253 --> 00:07:00,587
(BELL RINGS)

163
00:07:00,671 --> 00:07:01,880
SAVED BY THE BELL.

164
00:07:01,964 --> 00:07:05,676
WE'LL RESUME OUR DISCUSSION
NEXT CLASS.

165
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:11,223
WAIT UP.

166
00:07:11,306 --> 00:07:13,517
WHY? SO YOU CAN HANG
A SCARLET V ON MY CHEST?

167
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:16,562
(WHISPERS) BEING A VIRGIN
IS NOTHING TO BE ASHAMED OF.

168
00:07:16,645 --> 00:07:19,940
WELL, TRY BEING THE ONLY ONE
ON THE POWER SQUAD.

169
00:07:20,023 --> 00:07:22,776
LOSING YOUR VIRGINITY ISN'T
LIKE GETTING YOUR WISDOM TEETH
TAKEN OUT.

170
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:24,945
IT COMES WITH COMPLICATIONS.

171
00:07:25,028 --> 00:07:27,739
WELL, UNLIKE YOU,
I'VE HEARD OF A CONDOM.

172
00:07:27,823 --> 00:07:29,658
WHICH WON'T PROTECT YOU
FROM GETTING HURT.

173
00:07:29,741 --> 00:07:31,034
TRUST ME.

174
00:07:33,704 --> 00:07:36,540
THANKS FOR THE ADVICE,
JUNO.

00:17:11,031 --> 00:17:14,451
TELL ANYONE...
AND YOU'LL DESTROY ME.

349
00:17:14,535 --> 00:17:15,619
I KNOW.

350
00:17:16,453 --> 00:17:18,539
(KNOCK AT THE DOOR)

351
00:17:23,627 --> 00:17:26,630
UM, I'M LOOKING
FOR A HOLLY J.

352
00:17:33,554 --> 00:17:35,097
OKAY, YOU DON'T NEED
TO TALK TO ME,

353
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:37,641
BUT WE DO NEED TO FINISH
OUR PROJECT.

354
00:17:37,724 --> 00:17:40,185
ALL RIGHT, SO, ART ROOM.
AFTER SCHOOL.

355
00:17:40,269 --> 00:17:44,314
OR I'LL TELL MS. DAWES
WHY YOU DIDN'T SHOW.

356
00:17:50,654 --> 00:17:53,824
(HOSPITAL MONITOR BEEPS,
LOW HUM OF CHATTER)

357
00:17:53,907 --> 00:17:56,034
THE NURSE SAID IT'LL BE HARD
TO SPEAK FOR A WHILE.

358
00:17:56,118 --> 00:17:58,370
GETTING YOUR STOMACH PUMPED
DOES THAT.

359
00:17:58,453 --> 00:18:00,414
HOW DID I GET HERE?

360
00:18:00,497 --> 00:18:02,541
YOUR FRIENDS
DROPPED YOU OFF.

361
00:18:02,624 --> 00:18:05,085
THE SORORITY KNOWS I'M HERE?

362
00:18:05,169 --> 00:18:06,420
DID THEY CARE?

363
00:18:06,503 --> 00:18:08,630
NOT ENOUGH TO STAY.

364
00:18:08,714 --> 00:18:12,009
WELL, IT'S NOT THEIR FAULT.

365
00:18:12,092 --> 00:18:14,428
WOW,
YOU MUST REALLY WANT THIS.

366
00:18:14,511 --> 00:18:15,929
I DO.

367
00:18:16,013 --> 00:18:17,806
AND YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

368
00:18:17,890 --> 00:18:20,100
THE SORORITY HAS A REPUTATION
TO MAINTAIN.

369
00:18:20,184 --> 00:18:23,145
HELLO? YOU JUST
GOT YOUR STOMACH PUMPED.

370
00:18:23,228 --> 00:18:25,898
BESIDES,
IT'S TOO LATE FOR THAT.

371
00:18:30,903 --> 00:18:33,197
(DISSATISFIED EXHALE)

372
00:18:38,535 --> 00:18:39,244
AND?!

373
00:18:39,328 --> 00:18:40,204
I'M OUT.

374
00:18:41,455 --> 00:18:42,289
LIBERTY:
THE LONGER I STAY RIGHT HERE,

375
00:18:42,372 --> 00:18:45,042
THE LONGER I COULD STILL BE
A PI GAMMA PI.

376
00:18:45,125 --> 00:18:46,460
GOOD LUCK.

377
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:52,299
WE'RE REALLY DISAPPOINTED
IN YOU TWO.

378
00:18:52,382 --> 00:18:54,968
AND WE EXPECT BETTER
IN THE FUTURE.

379
00:18:55,052 --> 00:18:58,555
WE CAN'T HAVE NEGATIVE PRESS
ABOUT PI GAMMA PI.

380
00:18:58,639 --> 00:19:00,807
FUTURE?
WE CAN STAY?

381
00:19:01,391 --> 00:19:02,559
YES!

382
00:19:02,643 --> 00:19:04,394
WE WANT GIRLS
LIKE YOU TWO.

383
00:19:04,478 --> 00:19:06,396
SMART, BEAUTIFUL, LEADERS.

384
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:09,483
BECCA AND LIBERTY:
(ELATED LAUGHTER)

385
00:19:09,566 --> 00:19:11,944
UH, WHAT ABOUT JULIE?

386
00:19:12,027 --> 00:19:13,070
SHE'S ALL THOSE THINGS.

387
00:19:13,153 --> 00:19:14,780
WHY KICK HER OUT
FOR STREAKING?

388
00:19:14,863 --> 00:19:17,324
BECAUSE WE ONLY NEED ONE.

389
00:19:17,407 --> 00:19:19,326
(ANNOYED BREATH)

390
00:19:19,409 --> 00:19:20,869
ONE WHAT?

391
00:19:20,953 --> 00:19:24,206
WHAT SHANNON MEANS
IS WE'RE SEEKING DIVERSITY.

392
00:19:24,289 --> 00:19:26,625
OUR FUNDING DEPENDS UPON IT.

393
00:19:29,294 --> 00:19:31,672
SO THAT'S ALL I AM TO YOU?

394
00:19:31,755 --> 00:19:32,923
A TOKEN.

395
00:19:37,219 --> 00:19:38,720
(INCREDULOUS SIGH)

396
00:19:43,559 --> 00:19:46,562
LET'S JUST
GET THIS OVER WITH?

397
00:19:49,147 --> 00:19:50,858
BLUE:
I LIKE YOU, HOLLY J.

398
00:19:50,941 --> 00:19:51,692
AND UH...

399
00:19:52,192 --> 00:19:54,987
IF I HAVE TO DO THIS
TO PROVE IT TO YOU,

400
00:19:55,070 --> 00:19:56,154
I WILL.

401
00:19:58,156 --> 00:19:58,991
ALTHOUGH I'D PREFER TO WAIT

402
00:19:59,074 --> 00:20:02,327
UNTIL YOU KNOW HOW AWESOME
I REALLY AM.

403
00:20:05,789 --> 00:20:08,584
AREN'T WE HERE TO FINISH
OUR PROJECT?

404
00:20:08,667 --> 00:20:10,669
SO, THAT'S A "NO"?

405
00:20:11,587 --> 00:20:13,755
YOU'RE REJECTING ME?

406
00:20:16,425 --> 00:20:17,843
AS YOU WISH.

407
00:20:17,926 --> 00:20:19,386
BUT BEFORE WE GET TO BUSINESS,

408
00:20:19,469 --> 00:20:21,763
LET ME SHOW YOU THIS.

409
00:20:27,269 --> 00:20:28,896
HOLLY J:
I LOOK...

410
00:20:28,979 --> 00:20:29,813
BEAUTIFUL.

411
00:20:32,774 --> 00:20:36,278
AND IF WE DO SLEEP TOGETHER
SOMEDAY,

412
00:20:36,361 --> 00:20:38,572
IT WILL MEAN SOMETHING.

413
00:20:38,655 --> 00:20:42,159
LIKE YOU'LL EVER
GET ANOTHER CHANCE.

414
00:20:45,704 --> 00:20:48,832
THREE LATTES
AND ONE PEPPERMINT TEA.

415
00:20:48,916 --> 00:20:50,751
KELLY:
PEPPERMINT TEA?
FOR WHO?

416
00:20:50,834 --> 00:20:53,212
LIBERTY.
TO SOOTHE HER STOMACH.

417
00:20:53,295 --> 00:20:54,713
YEAH, WE WANNA SHOW HER
WE'RE HERE FOR HER.

418
00:20:54,796 --> 00:20:57,382
'CAUSE WHATEVER WE THINK
OF SORORITIES,

419
00:20:57,466 --> 00:20:59,384
SHE REALLY WANTED THIS.

420
00:21:02,971 --> 00:21:04,890
HEY, WHAT HAPPENED?

421
00:21:04,973 --> 00:21:06,642
WELL, I CAN APPLAUD THEM
FOR THE IDEA

422
00:21:06,725 --> 00:21:09,436
OF SEEKING OUT DIVERSITY,
BUT...

423
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:11,605
I TURNED THEM DOWN.

424
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:17,110
YOU WERE RIGHT.
THEY HAD A QUOTA.

425
00:21:17,194 --> 00:21:19,112
THEY DIDN'T WANT ME.
JUST A BLACK CHICK IN THE ROOM

426
00:21:19,196 --> 00:21:21,573
TO SATISFY ADMINISTRATION.

427
00:21:21,657 --> 00:21:24,409
I TOLD THEM
THAT WASN'T ME.

428
00:21:27,204 --> 00:21:28,205
(CUPS CLINK)
