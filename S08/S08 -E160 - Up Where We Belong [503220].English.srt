WHY WOULD YOU DO THIS?

354
00:16:04,590 --> 00:16:06,049
I'M ALREADY A TEEN MOM
STATISTIC,

355
00:16:06,133 --> 00:16:08,218
I THOUGHT I'D CONTRIBUTE
TO THE DROPOUT RATE.

356
00:16:08,302 --> 00:16:09,303
IT'S NOT A JOKE.

357
00:16:09,386 --> 00:16:11,471
IS THIS WHAT YOU WOULD WANT
FOR YOUR OWN DAUGHTER?

358
00:16:11,555 --> 00:16:12,764
EVERY DAY AT SCHOOL

359
00:16:12,848 --> 00:16:15,225
I FEEL LIKE
I'M NOT GOOD ENOUGH.

360
00:16:15,309 --> 00:16:17,019
AND I WANNA SUPPORT YOU
AND IZZY.

361
00:16:17,102 --> 00:16:21,356
YOU DON'T EVER NEED TO WORRY
ABOUT SUPPORTING THIS FAMILY.

362
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,734
WE DID JUST FINE
BEFORE MODELING.

363
00:16:23,817 --> 00:16:25,777
YOUR EDUCATION COMES FIRST.

364
00:16:25,861 --> 00:16:27,905
THIS IS MY DECISION.

365
00:16:27,988 --> 00:16:30,824
OKAY?
I DON'T WANNA GO BACK.

366
00:16:32,159 --> 00:16:33,160
(HEAVY SIGH)

367
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:40,083
ANNA:
REMEMBER WHAT YOU WANTED TO BE
WHEN YOU WERE LITTLE?

368
00:16:40,167 --> 00:16:40,709
MOM.

369
00:16:40,792 --> 00:16:42,920
ANNA:
YOU WANTED TO BE EVERYTHING.

370
00:16:43,003 --> 00:16:44,087
BAKER. JUDGE.

371
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:47,132
FIRE-FIGHTER.
PRIME MINISTER.

372
00:16:47,216 --> 00:16:49,218
VAMPIRE SLAYER!

373
00:16:49,301 --> 00:16:51,428
I CAN'T HELP BUT WONDER
WHAT HAPPENED TO THAT GIRL.

374
00:16:51,512 --> 00:16:53,013
SHE GREW UP.

375
00:16:54,348 --> 00:16:56,266
YOU'RE NOT THINKING
LONG TERM.

376
00:16:56,350 --> 00:16:57,726
I AM.

377
00:16:57,809 --> 00:16:59,311
I'M BEING REALISTIC.

378
00:16:59,394 --> 00:17:01,063
THEN AFTER MODELLING,

379
00:17:01,146 --> 00:17:03,232
IF IT DOESN'T LAST?

380
00:17:03,315 --> 00:17:05,234
WHAT WILL YOU DO?

381
00:17:07,819 --> 00:17:10,322
(MUTED CHATTER AND LAUGHTER
OF CHILDREN)

382
00:17:10,405 --> 00:17:11,949
IT'S OKAY NOT TO KNOW.

383
00:17:12,032 --> 00:17:14,326
YOU JUST HAVE TO MAKE SURE
YOU HAVE THE TOOLS

384
00:17:14,409 --> 00:17:16,370
TO FIGURE IT OUT.

385
00:17:21,166 --> 00:17:22,000
(SNIFFLES)

386
00:17:24,169 --> 00:17:24,920
HEY.

387
00:17:25,921 --> 00:17:28,549
WHY ARE YOU CRYING MOMMY?
DO YOU HAVE A BOOBOO?

388
00:17:28,632 --> 00:17:31,468
NO.
I JUST LOVE YOU SO MUCH.

389
00:17:39,226 --> 00:17:41,395
CHANTAY:
...AND REMEMBER,
IN FIVE YEARS

390
00:17:41,478 --> 00:17:44,940
WHEN TURN ON ETALK
OR PICK UP A COPY OF US WEEKLY,

391
00:17:45,023 --> 00:17:47,150
LOOK FOR MY NAME.
BECAUSE MY FUTURE?

392
00:17:47,234 --> 00:17:50,070
WILL BE ALL ABOUT REPORTING
ALL THOSE JUICY DETAILS.

393
00:17:50,153 --> 00:17:50,988
(APPLAUSE)

394
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:54,616
KWAN:
CONGRATULATIONS, CLASS,

395
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:56,743
YOU HAVE MADE IT THROUGH
GRADE ELEVEN ENGLISH.

396
00:17:56,827 --> 00:17:59,329
CLASS:
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

397
00:18:02,165 --> 00:18:03,834
MIA:
I WAS WONDERING
IF I COULD JOIN YOU GUYS.

398
00:18:03,917 --> 00:18:05,878
I HAVE A SPEECH
I'D LIKE TO SHARE.

399
00:18:05,961 --> 00:18:07,671
YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED
TO BE HERE.

400
00:18:07,754 --> 00:18:09,006
I'VE RE-REGISTERED.

401
00:18:09,089 --> 00:18:10,591
MS. SAUVE GAVE ME A NOTE.

402
00:18:10,674 --> 00:18:11,675
WELL, THAT'S NICE.

403
00:18:11,758 --> 00:18:13,010
BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN
YOU GET ANOTHER SHOT

404
00:18:13,093 --> 00:18:14,303
AT GIVING YOUR SPEECH.

405
00:18:14,386 --> 00:18:16,763
THAT WOULDN'T BE FAIR
TO YOUR CLASSMATES.

406
00:18:16,847 --> 00:18:17,931
PLEASE.

407
00:18:19,474 --> 00:18:24,104
YOU CAN GIVE YOUR SPEECH
IF THEY'RE OKAY WITH IT.

408
00:18:25,981 --> 00:18:27,691
OF COURSE WE ARE.

409
00:18:27,774 --> 00:18:29,610
YEAH, LET'S HEAR IT.

410
00:18:29,693 --> 00:18:31,862
BETTER BE GOOD, MS. JONES.

411
00:18:37,743 --> 00:18:38,785
(SIGHS)

412
00:18:39,328 --> 00:18:40,913
I UM...

413
00:18:40,996 --> 00:18:44,750
DON'T REALLY KNOW WHERE
I SEE MYSELF IN FIVE YEARS.

414
00:18:46,502 --> 00:18:48,462
AND I THINK THAT'S OKAY.

415
00:18:49,796 --> 00:18:52,299
MY PLAN FOR NOW?
IS KEEP MY OPTIONS OPEN.

416
00:18:52,382 --> 00:18:54,384
TAKE FRENCH AND HISTORY.

417
00:18:54,968 --> 00:18:57,221
AIM FOR GENERAL ARTS.

418
00:18:57,304 --> 00:18:58,931
BUT WITHIN THIS PLAN,
I HOPE

419
00:18:59,014 --> 00:19:01,183
AND EXPECT
TO BE SURPRISED.

420
00:19:01,266 --> 00:19:04,061
WHEN I WAS 12,
I HAD THIS...

421
00:19:04,144 --> 00:19:06,271
PERFECT FUTURE
ALL MAPPED OUT.

422
00:19:06,355 --> 00:19:08,607
...ORCHESTRA AND THEN
A REQUIRED INDUSTRY CO-OP

423
00:19:08,690 --> 00:19:11,777
WITH A SYMPHONY
OR EVEN A RECORD LABEL.

424
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:13,278
AND I KNOW I HAVE TO BE
RATIONAL,

425
00:19:13,362 --> 00:19:16,323
BUT, I WANNA START DOING THINGS
THAT INTEREST ME.

426
00:19:16,406 --> 00:19:19,201
MR. BHANDARI:
I DO NOT WANT YOU
TO LIMIT YOUR FUTURE.

427
00:19:19,284 --> 00:19:21,286
YOU ARE A BRIGHT YOUNG MAN.

428
00:19:21,370 --> 00:19:23,622
NOTHING IS SET IN STONE.
IF I WANNA BE AN ENGINEER,

429
00:19:23,705 --> 00:19:25,499
I'LL TAKE PHYSICS LATER.

430
00:19:25,582 --> 00:19:28,418
FOR RIGHT NOW?
I'M PURSUING MY DREAM.

431
00:19:28,502 --> 00:19:31,630
THIS DOES LOOK LIKE
A FASCINATING COURSE.

432
00:19:31,713 --> 00:19:33,757
I JUST HOPE YOU ARE MAKING
THE RIGHT CHOICE.

433
00:19:33,841 --> 00:19:35,092
MIA:
...THEN LIFE HAPPENED.

434
00:19:35,175 --> 00:19:36,260
I HAD A DAUGHTER AT 13

435
00:19:36,343 --> 00:19:39,263
AND SUDDENLY
I DIDN'T COME FIRST ANYMORE

436
00:19:39,346 --> 00:19:40,931
I HAD TO ACCEPT A REALITY

437
00:19:41,014 --> 00:19:44,768
THAT WAS VERY DIFFERENT
FROM THE ONE I ONCE IMAGINED...

438
00:19:44,852 --> 00:19:47,855
I'M SORRY
FOR THE WAY I ACTED.

439
00:19:49,565 --> 00:19:51,233
I TRIED AGAIN.

440
00:19:54,111 --> 00:19:55,404
MAYBE THE OLD ONE'S BETTER...

441
00:19:55,487 --> 00:19:57,322
MS. DAWES:
NO.

442
00:19:57,406 --> 00:19:59,825
THIS IS A SINCLAIR ORIGINAL.

443
00:19:59,908 --> 00:20:01,326
THIS UGLY THING IS RIGHT?

444
00:20:01,410 --> 00:20:04,746
YES, BECAUSE IT'S YOUR
INTERPRETATION.

445
00:20:04,830 --> 00:20:06,498
AN EXPRESSION.

446
00:20:08,542 --> 00:20:10,836
BUT IT'S STILL
NOT VERY GOOD, IS IT?

447
00:20:10,919 --> 00:20:13,755
LISTEN, I LOVE TO SING
IN THE SHOWER.

448
00:20:13,839 --> 00:20:17,718
DOESN'T MEAN I'LL SELL OUT
CARNEGIE HALL ANYTIME SOON.

449
00:20:17,801 --> 00:20:20,929
SO WILL I SEE YOU IN ART
NEXT TERM?

450
00:20:21,013 --> 00:20:22,973
DON'T THINK SO.

451
00:20:23,056 --> 00:20:24,808
BUT I'LL CONSIDER
ART APPRECIATION.

452
00:20:24,892 --> 00:20:27,477
MIA:
THE UNEXPECTED
CAN BE TERRIFYING.

453
00:20:27,561 --> 00:20:29,938
BUT I ENCOURAGE EACH OF YOU
TO EMBRACE IT.

454
00:20:30,022 --> 00:20:30,981
BECAUSE SOMETIMES

455
00:20:31,064 --> 00:20:32,608
IT'S THE THINGS
YOU DON'T ANTICIPATE

456
00:20:32,691 --> 00:20:34,151
THAT MAKE THE BIGGEST IMPACT.

457
00:20:34,234 --> 00:20:37,029
YOU CONVINCED YOUR PARENTS?
HOW?!

458
00:20:37,112 --> 00:20:40,949
MIA:
SO, IT'S THE JOURNEY, RIGHT?
NOT THE DESTINATION.

459
00:20:41,033 --> 00:20:42,034
AND HIGH SCHOOL,
I'VE DECIDED,

460
00:20:42,117 --> 00:20:44,077
IS AN IMPORTANT PART
OF MY JOURNEY.

461
00:20:44,161 --> 00:20:46,330
SAUVE:
WELL, EXAM WEEK IS GONNA BE
A LOT OF HARD WORK.

462
00:20:46,413 --> 00:20:47,539
MATH FINAL TO ACE,

463
00:20:47,623 --> 00:20:49,374
ENGLISH MAKE-UP
ASSIGNMENTS.

464
00:20:49,458 --> 00:20:50,459
I KNOW.

465
00:20:50,542 --> 00:20:51,502
AND WHAT ABOUT MODELING?

466
00:20:51,585 --> 00:20:52,544
MIA:
STILL DOING IT.

467
00:20:52,628 --> 00:20:54,963
BUT ONLY DURING HOLIDAYS
AND IN THE SUMMER.

468
00:20:55,047 --> 00:20:57,174
SAUVE:
WELL, COMING BACK
TAKES A LOT OF COURAGE.

469
00:20:57,257 --> 00:20:58,717
YOU SHOULD GIVE YOURSELF
A PAT ON THE BACK.

470
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:01,512
(HALF LAUGHS)
MAYBE AFTER EXAMS.

471
00:21:01,595 --> 00:21:04,097
♪ Inside my heart
I know your... ♪

472
00:21:05,557 --> 00:21:07,017

473
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:09,520
ALREADY POSTED
ON THE ANTI-GRAPEVINE.

474
00:21:09,603 --> 00:21:12,022

475
00:21:12,105 --> 00:21:14,441
ANYA, I WAS ONLY GONE A DAY!

UM, I KNOW MY SPIDEY QUOTES,

479
00:21:20,948 --> 00:21:22,741

THE OTHER WAY AROUND.

480
00:21:22,824 --> 00:21:25,619

NO ONE'S PERFECT.

482
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:29,665
WE'VE GOT EXAM WEEK
TO GET THROUGH.

LET'S DO IT.
