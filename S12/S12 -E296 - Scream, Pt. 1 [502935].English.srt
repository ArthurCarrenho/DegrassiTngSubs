TO TAKE DOWN ASHER.

351
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:37,628
LET ME FINISH
THE NEW ENDING,

352
00:14:37,711 --> 00:14:39,379
THEN I'LL FIGURE
SOMETHING OUT.

353
00:14:39,463 --> 00:14:41,215
OKAY, UM...

354
00:14:41,298 --> 00:14:43,675
BUT I THINK I ACTUALLY
MIGHT BE ON TO SOMETHING.

355
00:14:45,511 --> 00:14:46,887
ELI:
THE TORONTO JOURNALISM AWARDS?

356
00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:48,555
IT'S TOMORROW,

357
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:49,431
WHICH MEANS AN EMPTY
"INTERPRETER" OFFICE.

358
00:14:49,515 --> 00:14:51,016
WE CAN SNEAK IN

359
00:14:51,099 --> 00:14:51,767
AND PLANT SOMETHING
ON ASHER'S COMPUTER.

360
00:14:51,850 --> 00:14:52,976
NO, THAT WON'T WORK!

361
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:54,978
HE HAS EVIDENCE
AGAINST ME!

362
00:14:55,062 --> 00:14:56,063
I'M GONNA NEED
SOMETHING ON HIM

363
00:14:56,146 --> 00:14:57,564
IF I'M EVER GONNA
CLEAR MY NAME.

364
00:14:57,648 --> 00:14:59,399
NO, THE PLAY!

365
00:15:02,611 --> 00:15:04,488
AH...

366
00:15:04,571 --> 00:15:06,156
OPENING NIGHT, RIGHT.

367
00:15:08,450 --> 00:15:12,204
MAYBE THERE'S A WAY
TO DO BOTH.

368
00:15:12,287 --> 00:15:13,872
I KNEW YOU WERE THE ONE PERSON
I COULD COUNT ON.

369
00:15:13,956 --> 00:15:15,457
THANK YOU!

370
00:15:21,004 --> 00:15:22,506
(SIGHS)

371
00:15:26,093 --> 00:15:27,594
UM...

372
00:15:29,096 --> 00:15:30,472
BEFORE WE START
ON OUR PROJECT,

373
00:15:30,556 --> 00:15:31,932
I WANTED TO SAY
A COUPLE OF THINGS.

374
00:15:32,015 --> 00:15:33,517
OKEY-DOKE.

375
00:15:34,434 --> 00:15:36,979
EVERYONE HERE ACTS LIKE
HOW I FEEL IS CRAZY,

376
00:15:37,062 --> 00:15:38,772
BUT THERE ARE A HUNDRED MILLION
OTHER BAPTISTS,

377
00:15:38,856 --> 00:15:40,440
AND TWO BILLION
OTHER CHRISTIANS.

378
00:15:40,524 --> 00:15:41,984
EVEN I WENT TO CHURCH
AS A KID.

379
00:15:42,067 --> 00:15:43,652
YOU DID?

380
00:15:43,735 --> 00:15:45,070
WHICH IS WHY I KNOW
NOT ALL CHRISTIANS

381
00:15:45,153 --> 00:15:48,699
SHARE THE SAME BELIEFS
AS YOU DO.

382
00:15:48,782 --> 00:15:51,827
THE BIBLE SAYS THAT
HOMOSEXUALITY IS WRONG,

383
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:55,122
BUT THE BIBLE ALSO OFFERS
A PATHWAY TO A GREAT LIFE.

384
00:15:55,205 --> 00:15:57,833
I'M JUST TRYING TO HELP PEOPLE
FIND THEIR WAY.

385
00:15:57,916 --> 00:16:00,294
OKAY, MY TURN.

386
00:16:00,377 --> 00:16:03,255
I THOUGHT THAT WE COULD USE THIS
FOR OUR PROJECT.

387
00:16:03,338 --> 00:16:05,424
A FOSSILIZED AMMONITE.

388
00:16:05,507 --> 00:16:08,051
SEVENTY MILLION YEARS OLD!

389
00:16:08,135 --> 00:16:09,636
WOW!
THAT'S INCREDIBLE!

390
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:12,139
INCREDIBLE
AS IN NOT CREDIBLE?

391
00:16:12,222 --> 00:16:13,557
AS IN
YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME?

392
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:15,184
WHY WOULDN'T
I BELIEVE YOU?

393
00:16:15,267 --> 00:16:16,560
WELL, DOESN'T THE BIBLE

394
00:16:16,643 --> 00:16:19,730
SAY THE EARTH
IS ONLY 6000 YEARS OLD?

395
00:16:19,813 --> 00:16:23,066
BUT...ISN'T THAT SORT OF
A METAPHOR?

396
00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:24,359
I MEAN, JUST 'CAUSE
I'M A GOOD CHRISTIAN,

397
00:16:24,443 --> 00:16:25,986
DOESN'T MEAN
I CAN'T LOVE SCIENCE.

398
00:16:26,069 --> 00:16:29,615
SO YOU'LL LOOK PAST THE BIBLE
FOR A MOLLUSC,

399
00:16:29,698 --> 00:16:31,950
BUT NOT WHEN YOU SEE A PLAY
ABOUT TWO DUDES IN LOVE?

400
00:16:32,034 --> 00:16:34,745
IT'S JUST UNNATURAL.

401
00:16:34,828 --> 00:16:36,830
BECAUSE OF INTOLERANCE
LIKE YOURS,

402
00:16:36,914 --> 00:16:38,665
I'VE BEEN THROWN OUT
OF WASHROOMS,

403
00:16:38,749 --> 00:16:41,084
BEATEN UP BAD.

404
00:16:41,168 --> 00:16:42,628
I WOULD NEVER DO
ANY OF THAT.
BUT THE STUFF YOU SAY

405
00:16:42,711 --> 00:16:44,087
MAKES PEOPLE THINK
IT'S OKAY

406
00:16:44,171 --> 00:16:46,006
TO BULLY KIDS WHO ARE GAY,
OR TRANSGENDER,

407
00:16:46,089 --> 00:16:49,218
OR DIFFERENT IN ANY WAY!

408
00:16:49,301 --> 00:16:51,553
I THINK WE SHOULD WORK
SEPARATELY.

409
00:16:51,637 --> 00:16:52,930
I'LL SEND YOU THE DATA,

410
00:16:53,013 --> 00:16:55,849
AND YOU CAN MAKE
FRILLY CHARTS.

411
00:17:04,983 --> 00:17:06,276
I FOUND LOVE...

412
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:08,987
IN A HOPELESS PLACE!

413
00:17:09,071 --> 00:17:11,657
WELL, IN A THEATRE,
WITH THAT CUTE STAGEHAND.

414
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:13,617
THE BRAZILIAN GUY WITH
THE MOHAWK AND THE MUSCLES?

415
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:15,702
YEAH-HUH.

416
00:17:15,786 --> 00:17:16,620
TORI:
DID YOU GET HIS NAME?

417
00:17:16,703 --> 00:17:18,455
WELL,
WE DIDN'T EXACTLY TALK.

418
00:17:18,539 --> 00:17:19,957
YOU JUST KISSED?!

419
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:21,542
WE SHARED...A LOOK,

420
00:17:23,418 --> 00:17:24,837
BUT THERE WAS A SPARK.

421
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:27,923
NOW I JUST HAVE
TO TALK TO HIM.

422
00:17:28,006 --> 00:17:30,968
TALKING TO CUTE GUYS
ISN'T EXACTLY YOUR STRONG SUIT.

423
00:17:31,051 --> 00:17:33,053
TRISTAN:
WHY ARE YOU BEING
SO NEGATIVE?

424
00:17:33,136 --> 00:17:34,012
DON'T YOU NOT WANT ME
TO HAVE MY DREAMY, ROMANTIC,

425
00:17:34,096 --> 00:17:36,181
PERFECT FIRST KISS?

426
00:17:36,265 --> 00:17:37,641
I JUST DON'T WANT YOU
TO GET YOUR HOPES UP.

427
00:17:37,724 --> 00:17:39,685
SO YOU GET TO BE IN LOVE,

428
00:17:39,768 --> 00:17:42,437
AND MAYA GETS TO BE IN LOVE,
BUT I DON'T?

429
00:17:42,521 --> 00:17:43,522
TORI:
YOU WILL! I JUST DON'T WANT YOU
TO GET HURT

430
00:17:43,605 --> 00:17:45,566
BEFORE OPENING NIGHT.

431
00:17:45,649 --> 00:17:47,109
THANKS FOR LOOKING OUT
FOR ME,

432
00:17:47,192 --> 00:17:48,026
BUT I'M GONNA GET THAT BOY
TO KISS ME,

433
00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:49,611
MARK MY WORDS.

434
00:17:57,119 --> 00:17:58,871
ROMEO AND JULES' SUICIDES
CAN'T BE ROMANTIC.

435
00:17:58,954 --> 00:18:01,290
SO AFTER THEY KILL THEMSELVES,

436
00:18:01,373 --> 00:18:03,750
THEIR SPIRITS SHOULD RISE
FROM THEIR BODIES,

437
00:18:03,834 --> 00:18:05,210
THEN BE TORN APART
HALFWAY UP,

438
00:18:05,294 --> 00:18:06,795
SEPARATED FOREVER...

439
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:09,882
WE'LL NEED LONGER POLES.

440
00:18:11,842 --> 00:18:12,759
IT'LL TAKE ME A FEW HOURS
TO RIG UP.

441
00:18:12,843 --> 00:18:14,678
HOURS?!

442
00:18:14,761 --> 00:18:16,013
BUT WE STILL NEED
TO TEST IT

443
00:18:16,096 --> 00:18:18,265
BEFORE I SUBMIT MY PROPOSAL
TO MR. SIMPSON!

444
00:18:18,348 --> 00:18:19,850
(WINCES)
AGH!

445
00:18:21,727 --> 00:18:24,271
ARE YOU OKAY?
YEAH, I'M FINE!

446
00:18:24,354 --> 00:18:25,314
THERE'S JUST NO TIME.

447
00:18:25,397 --> 00:18:26,732
I NEED TO SAVE THE PLAY,

448
00:18:26,815 --> 00:18:28,650
AND THEN THERE'S CLARE.
WHOA! DEJA VU.

449
00:18:31,945 --> 00:18:32,905
I'M NOT HAVING
A MANIC EPISODE,

450
00:18:32,988 --> 00:18:34,031
IF THAT'S WHAT
YOU'RE GETTING AT.

451
00:18:34,114 --> 00:18:35,741
BUT CHANGING THE END
OF A PLAY,

452
00:18:35,824 --> 00:18:38,452
DOING EVERYTHING
FOR CLARE...

453
00:18:38,535 --> 00:18:40,662
I'M GLAD I'M NO LONGER
CAUGHT UP IN HURRICANE ELI.

454
00:18:40,746 --> 00:18:42,164
AM I REALLY THAT BAD?

455
00:18:42,247 --> 00:18:43,457
YOU'RE LIKE ROMEO -

456
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:45,959
PASSIONATE, IMPULSIVE.

457
00:18:46,043 --> 00:18:46,877
HE'LL DO ANYTHING
FOR THE THINGS

458
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,879
AND PEOPLE THAT HE LOVES.

459
00:18:48,962 --> 00:18:51,673
BUT FOR ALL HIS CRAZY
ROMANCE...

460
00:18:51,757 --> 00:18:53,258
ROMEO STILL ENDED UP DEAD.

461
00:19:01,934 --> 00:19:03,810
WHY IS SIMPSON LEAVING US
HANGING LIKE THIS?

462
00:19:03,894 --> 00:19:06,313
I HANDED THAT PROPOSAL IN
TWELVE HOURS AGO!

463
00:19:06,396 --> 00:19:08,398
IMOGEN:
HE PROBABLY HAS TO DISCUSS
HIS DECISION WITH THE BAKERS.

464
00:19:08,482 --> 00:19:10,150
AWESOME.

465
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:12,861
DALLAS:
NERVOUS?

466
00:19:13,737 --> 00:19:15,239
MR. SIMPSON:
ELI.

467
00:19:22,913 --> 00:19:25,207
GREAT JOB ON THE REWRITE.

468
00:19:25,290 --> 00:19:25,958
CAN'T WAIT TO SEE IT
TONIGHT.

469
00:19:26,041 --> 00:19:27,918
(RELIEVED SIGH)

470
00:19:28,001 --> 00:19:29,503
ELI: YAY!
DALLAS: THIS AIN'T OVER.

471
00:19:33,799 --> 00:19:35,300
EXCUSE ME A SECOND?

472
00:19:36,969 --> 00:19:38,929
(SIGHS)

473
00:19:39,012 --> 00:19:40,889
IT LOOKS LIKE
YOU GOT GOOD NEWS.

474
00:19:40,973 --> 00:19:43,100
YEAH,
THE PLAY'S GOING FORWARD.

475
00:19:43,183 --> 00:19:45,602
WELL THEN,
WHY THE MOPEY FACE?

476
00:19:45,686 --> 00:19:49,898
BECAUSE REWRITING THE END
OF THE MUSICAL MADE ME REALIZE

477
00:19:49,982 --> 00:19:51,358
"ROMEO AND JULES"
IS ABOUT TEENAGERS

478
00:19:51,441 --> 00:19:53,652
WHO MAKE
AN IMPULSIVE DECISION

479
00:19:53,735 --> 00:19:55,988
AND IT GOES HORRIBLY WRONG.

480
00:19:56,071 --> 00:19:58,323
NO, ELI, NO!

481
00:19:58,407 --> 00:20:00,284
I STAYED UP ALL NIGHT
READING CASE LAW

482
00:20:00,367 --> 00:20:01,994
ON WORKPLACE HARASSMENT.

483
00:20:02,077 --> 00:20:03,161
I KNOW HOW
WE CAN GET ASHER.

484
00:20:03,245 --> 00:20:04,621
THIS IS A SOLID PLAN!

485
00:20:04,705 --> 00:20:07,124
I'VE HAD PLANS, TOO.

486
00:20:07,207 --> 00:20:11,253
FITZ AND THE FAKE IDS,
VEGAS NIGHT, LOVE ROULETTE!

487
00:20:11,336 --> 00:20:13,046
THEY NEVER END WELL.
SO YOU'RE JUST GONNA
LET ASHER

488
00:20:13,130 --> 00:20:14,089
GET AWAY WITH EVERYTHING
HE DID TO ME?

489
00:20:14,173 --> 00:20:15,674
NO!

490
00:20:16,967 --> 00:20:18,051
I'VE COME UP
WITH SOMETHING BETTER.

491
00:20:18,135 --> 00:20:19,636
WHAT IS IT?

492
00:20:21,054 --> 00:20:24,391
YOU'RE GOING TO TALK
TO MS. OH.

493
00:20:24,474 --> 00:20:25,893
NO!
NO, I CAN'T TELL HER!

494
00:20:25,976 --> 00:20:27,477
I ALREADY DID.

495
00:20:29,521 --> 00:20:31,190
SHE'S WAITING
TO GO OVER YOUR STORY.

496
00:20:32,107 --> 00:20:40,199
♪♪♪

497
00:20:42,284 --> 00:20:45,287
I TRIED TO TALK TO THAT CUTE
STAGEHAND AFTER SCHOOL,

498
00:20:45,370 --> 00:20:47,456
BUT I GOT SO NERVOUS
I TURNED TO RUN AWAY,

499
00:20:47,539 --> 00:20:48,790
TRIPPED,
AND FELL INTO A SHRUB.

500
00:20:48,874 --> 00:20:50,501
(LAUGHS)

501
00:20:50,584 --> 00:20:53,879
DID HE NOTICE?
NO, THANK HEAVENS.

502
00:20:53,962 --> 00:20:56,381
BUT SITTING IN THAT SPRUCE,
IT GAVE ME TIME TO THINK.

503
00:20:56,465 --> 00:20:59,301
MAYBE TORI'S RIGHT,
MAYBE I CAN'T TALK TO GUYS.

504
00:20:59,384 --> 00:21:02,012
HEY, YOU STILL HAVE YOUR OPENING
NIGHT TONIGHT, RIGHT?

505
00:21:02,095 --> 00:21:03,597
SHUT UP!

506
00:21:07,392 --> 00:21:08,894
APOLOGY FROM TORI?

507
00:21:15,025 --> 00:21:17,027
IT'S A LETTER

508
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:18,946
FROM...A SECRET ADMIRER.

509
00:21:20,572 --> 00:21:22,241
"TRISTAN,

510
00:21:22,324 --> 00:21:24,243
A ROSE BY ANOTHER NAME,
BUT STILL AS SWEET.

511
00:21:24,326 --> 00:21:26,954
I'VE BEEN WATCHING YOU
AND I WANT TO MEET."

512
00:21:27,037 --> 00:21:29,164
THIS GUY LIKES YOU!

513
00:21:29,248 --> 00:21:31,375
AND HE WANTS TO MEET ME
RIGHT NOW?

514
00:21:31,458 --> 00:21:33,627
DON'T YOU HAVE REHEARSAL
IN LIKE HALF AN HOUR?

515
00:21:33,710 --> 00:21:34,962
IT COULD MEAN GETTING
MY FIRST KISS

516
00:21:35,045 --> 00:21:37,714
BEFORE I HAVE TO KISS
DAVE TONIGHT!

517
00:21:37,798 --> 00:21:38,924
I WOULDN'T WANNA RISK
LETTING THAT MANY PEOPLE DOWN.

518
00:21:39,007 --> 00:21:40,300
OH, ME NEITHER.

519
00:21:40,384 --> 00:21:42,177
BUT...ON THE OTHER HAND,

520
00:21:43,470 --> 00:21:45,430
(SIGHS)

521
00:21:45,514 --> 00:21:46,598
IT'S FOR LOVE!

522
00:21:46,682 --> 00:21:48,183
(LAUGHS)
