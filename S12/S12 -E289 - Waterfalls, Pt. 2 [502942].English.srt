TO KEEP IT A SECRET?

WAIT, YOU DIDN'T LIKE IT,
DID YOU?

98
00:03:51,607 --> 00:03:52,941
WHAT? NO!

00:04:02,701 --> 00:04:04,453
YOU DIDN'T TELL ELI?

105
00:04:04,536 --> 00:04:06,371
I CAN'T.
HE WOULD KILL ASHER!

106

SO IMMATURELY.

108
00:04:12,336 --> 00:04:13,670

109
00:04:13,754 --> 00:04:14,880
WHAT HE DID
WAS SEXUAL HARASSMENT!

00:04:14,963 --> 00:04:15,506
WE HAVE TO TELL MS. OH.

111
00:04:15,589 --> 00:04:17,841

IS TOO IMPORTANT TO ME

113
00:04:18,926 --> 00:04:20,427
TO SCREW IT UP!

114

132
00:04:56,588 --> 00:04:58,048
I KNOW IF MY MOM
GAVE HIM A CHANCE,

133
00:04:58,131 --> 00:05:00,676

WHAT A GREAT GUY HE IS.

134

136
00:05:06,348 --> 00:05:09,184
NO, I CAN'T.
I PROMISED I'D STAY OUT OF IT.

NO, UM...

145
00:05:47,890 --> 00:05:50,184
I REALLY ADMIRE YOU...

146
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:53,312
BUT IT'S WRONG

147
00:05:54,897 --> 00:05:55,522
AND YOU'RE MY BOSS
AND I DIDN'T-

148
00:05:55,606 --> 00:05:57,107
I UNDERSTAND.

149
00:05:57,649 --> 00:05:59,151
YOU DO?

150
00:05:59,234 --> 00:06:01,695
I'M SO SORRY.

151
00:06:01,778 --> 00:06:03,447
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT GOT INTO ME.

152
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:07,159
I'VE BEEN UNDER
A LOT OF STRESS LATELY.

153

MY WIFE IS ASKING
FOR A DIVORCE.

154
00:06:13,498 --> 00:06:15,334
MY PARENTS GOT DIVORCED
LAST YEAR

155
00:06:17,419 --> 00:06:20,631
AND IT WAS HARD
AND COMPLICATED.

156
00:06:20,714 --> 00:06:21,840
ALL OF A SUDDEN,
I WAS DATING MY STEPBROTHER...

157
00:06:21,924 --> 00:06:23,717
BUT THAT'S A LONG STORY.

158
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,302
THE POINT IS...

159
00:06:27,346 --> 00:06:29,806
WE'RE ALL HAPPIER
THAN EVER NOW.

160
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:31,391
WE MADE IT THROUGH.

161
00:06:33,644 --> 00:06:37,105
YOU ARE VERY MATURE
FOR YOUR AGE.

162
00:06:37,189 --> 00:06:39,942
I HOPE YOU DON'T
HATE ME.

163
00:06:40,025 --> 00:06:41,527
I DON'T HATE YOU,
ASHER,

164
00:06:43,487 --> 00:06:45,155
BUT I NEED TO KNOW,

165
00:06:45,239 --> 00:06:47,074
WHY DIDN'T YOU RUN
MY ARTICLE?

166
00:06:47,157 --> 00:06:49,284
I DIDN'T GET A CHANCE
TO TELL YOU.

167
00:06:49,368 --> 00:06:50,536
I WANTED TO GIVE IT
THE BEST POSSIBLE REAL ESTATE,

168
00:06:50,619 --> 00:06:51,537
WHICH IS WHY
WE'RE RUNNING IT

169
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:54,540
ON FRIDAY'S

HILARY:
SORRY TO INTERRUPT,
ASHER.

171
00:06:56,583 --> 00:06:57,417
I NEED YOU TO GO
TO THAT PRESS CONFERENCE

172
00:06:57,501 --> 00:06:58,168
AT CITY HALL THIS AFTERNOON.

173
00:06:58,252 --> 00:06:59,753
SURE THING, BOSS.

174
00:07:03,465 --> 00:07:06,301
YOU DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING
TO ANYONE

175
00:07:06,385 --> 00:07:08,470
ABOUT LAST NIGHT,
DID YOU?

176
00:07:08,554 --> 00:07:09,388
NO, NO,
OF COURSE NOT.

177
00:07:09,471 --> 00:07:10,556
I WON'T.

178
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:12,140

TO THIS PRESS CONFERENCE?

181
00:07:16,019 --> 00:07:17,312
IT'S A GREAT OPPORTUNITY

182
00:07:17,396 --> 00:07:19,314
FOR A BUDDING
YOUNG JOURNALIST.

183
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:23,277

186
00:07:29,116 --> 00:07:31,243
IT'S GOOD.

187
00:07:31,326 --> 00:07:33,120
UM, YOU KNOW YOU DIDN'T HAVE
TO DO ALL THIS THOUGH, RIGHT?

188
00:07:33,203 --> 00:07:35,038
OH, I JUST GOT IT
FROM THE CAFETERIA.

189
00:07:35,122 --> 00:07:35,622
IT'S IMPORTANT
TO LOAD UP ON CARBS

190
00:07:35,706 --> 00:07:39,543

191
00:07:39,626 --> 00:07:42,504
SO, WHO ARE YOU PLAYING
TONIGHT?

192
00:07:42,588 --> 00:07:43,881
I THOUGHT YOU DIDN'T
LIKE HOCKEY?

193
00:07:43,964 --> 00:07:45,507
DID I SAY THAT?

194
00:07:45,591 --> 00:07:46,967
I MEANT I'VE NEVER BEEN
EXPOSED TO HOCKEY.

195
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:49,887
WE PLAYED SOCCER
AT MY HOUSE.

196
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:52,097
UH, WELL, WE DON'T HAVE

00:07:52,806 --> 00:07:53,849
DON'T BE SILLY.

199
00:07:53,932 --> 00:07:55,100
HOCKEY'S A BIG PART

200
00:07:55,184 --> 00:07:57,269
AND I WANNA KNOW
ALL ABOUT IT.

201
00:07:57,352 --> 00:07:59,771
SO IS IT TRUE
YOU MIGHT GO TO THE NHL?

207
00:08:07,905 --> 00:08:09,406
OH, I'M SO SORRY,

208
00:08:10,991 --> 00:08:12,075
I'M GONNA CLEAN THAT.

209
00:08:12,159 --> 00:08:12,868

DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

210
00:08:12,951 --> 00:08:14,203
UM, NO, NO, NO.
I ACTUALLY-

211
00:08:14,286 --> 00:08:16,121
I HAVE ANOTHER SHIRT

212
00:08:16,205 --> 00:08:18,373
UM, I SHOULD GO GET IT NOW
OR I MIGHT MISS THE BUS.

213
00:08:18,457 --> 00:08:19,583
RIGHT, THE TEAM NEEDS
THEIR STAR PLAYER!

214
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:21,168

KC:
I'M SORRY ABOUT LAST NIGHT.

222
00:08:47,486 --> 00:08:49,154
TRYING TO SET YOU UP
WITH MY MOM WAS UH...

223
00:08:49,238 --> 00:08:50,322
UNCOOL.

224
00:08:50,405 --> 00:08:52,199
IT'S ALL RIGHT, KC.

225
00:08:52,282 --> 00:08:53,951
I'M FLATTERED.

226
00:08:54,034 --> 00:08:55,327
I JUST- I WANTED TO HELP
HER OUT, YOU KNOW?

227
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:57,037
SHE DOES SO MUCH FOR ME.

228
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,372
WELL, SHE SOUNDS LIKE
A REALLY STRONG WOMAN.

229
00:08:58,455 --> 00:09:01,041
SHE IS.
SHE'S THE BEST.

230
00:09:01,124 --> 00:09:03,794
AND WHAT ABOUT YOUR DAD?
IS HE IN THE PICTURE?

231
00:09:03,877 --> 00:09:05,587
HE, UH, SPLIT
A LONG TIME AGO,

232
00:09:05,671 --> 00:09:07,256
BUT WE'RE BETTER OFF
WITHOUT HIM.

233
00:09:07,339 --> 00:09:11,385
SO YOUR MOM IS SINGLE?
(NERVOUS EXHALE)

234
00:09:11,468 --> 00:09:16,598
YES! SHE'S, UH, TOTALLY
100 PERCENT SINGLE.

235
00:09:16,682 --> 00:09:18,684
NOW, ARE WE READY TO KICK
SOME BARDELL BUTT TOMORROW?

236
00:09:18,767 --> 00:09:19,768
WELL, I MADE A PROMISE
TO MY MOM

237
00:09:19,852 --> 00:09:22,104
AND I DON'T BREAK PROMISES,
MR. T.

238
00:09:22,187 --> 00:09:24,690

(CAR DOOR SLAMS SHUTS)

245
00:09:34,449 --> 00:09:36,201
I THOUGHT THE MAYOR WAS GONNA
BURST A BLOOD VESSEL!

246
00:09:36,285 --> 00:09:37,369
HOW DID YOU LEARN
HOW TO DO THAT?

247
00:09:37,452 --> 00:09:39,121
EARN SOMEONE'S TRUST
AND THEN - WHAM! -

248
00:09:39,204 --> 00:09:40,539
HIT THEM WITH A GRENADE?

249
00:09:40,622 --> 00:09:42,875
I'VE HAD A FEW YEARS
PRACTICE.

250
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:44,751
FORGET HIGH SCHOOL,
FORGET UNIVERSITY,

251
00:09:44,835 --> 00:09:45,961
I WANNA FAST FORWARD
TO THIS,

252
00:09:46,044 --> 00:09:47,171

(SIGHS)

254
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:51,842
WHAT?

255
00:09:55,304 --> 00:09:59,016
YOU REMIND ME OF MYSELF
WHEN I WAS YOUR AGE.

256
00:09:59,099 --> 00:10:02,561
YOU KNOW THIS FEELING
THAT YOU HAVE RIGHT NOW?

257
00:10:02,644 --> 00:10:05,606
REMEMBER IT.
NEVER LOSE IT.

258
00:10:08,525 --> 00:10:10,027
IMPOSSIBLE.

259
00:10:12,905 --> 00:10:15,657
THERE'S SOMETHING
I NEED TO SHOW YOU.

260
00:10:15,741 --> 00:10:18,202

WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

266
00:10:37,012 --> 00:10:37,930

KC:
NOTHING.

298
00:11:36,655 --> 00:11:39,449
IT'S JUST THAT MR. TOWNSEND'S
GONNA BE THERE

299
00:11:39,533 --> 00:11:41,368
AND HE BASICALLY TOLD ME
THAT HE'S IN LOVE WITH YOU.

I SWEAR.

303
00:11:45,664 --> 00:11:48,041
BUT THEN HE STARTED QUIZZING ME
ABOUT YOU AND...

304
00:11:48,125 --> 00:11:49,543
