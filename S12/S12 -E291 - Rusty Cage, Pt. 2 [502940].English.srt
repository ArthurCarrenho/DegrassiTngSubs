IT WAS AN ACCIDENT!

531
00:21:09,394 --> 00:21:11,313
DO YOU SWEAR?

532
00:21:11,396 --> 00:21:13,774
MAYA, I'M NOT SOME LOSER
WHO TRIES TO HURT HIMSELF.

533
00:21:15,108 --> 00:21:17,402
BESIDES, THIS WILL
GIVE ME MORE TIME

534
00:21:17,486 --> 00:21:18,529
TO HANG OUT WITH YOU
AND THE GUYS.

535
00:21:18,612 --> 00:21:20,197
IS THAT COOL?

536
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:23,116
WELL, IT DEPENDS;
ARE YOU GONNA BE HAPPY?

537
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:25,911
I HAVE NO REASON
NOT TO BE.

538
00:21:25,994 --> 00:21:26,828
SO WHAT HAPPENS
WHEN YOUR ARM GETS BETTER

539
00:21:26,912 --> 00:21:28,664
AND YOU GO BACK
TO HOCKEY?

540
00:21:31,416 --> 00:21:33,252
MAYA, I'M HAPPY NOW...

541
00:21:33,335 --> 00:21:34,837
WITH YOU.

542
00:21:42,177 --> 00:21:44,263
I'M JUST SO GLAD
YOU'RE OKAY.

543
00:21:44,346 --> 00:21:46,974
YEAH, I AM.
I'M GREAT.
