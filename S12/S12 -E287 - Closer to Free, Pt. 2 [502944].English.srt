00:00:06,006 --> 00:00:08,342
ALLI:
BECAUSE ADOPTING A NEW RELIGION
IS A VERY BIG DEAL!

4
00:00:08,425 --> 00:00:09,051
WELL, I WAS SEARCHING
FOR SOMETHING

5
00:00:09,134 --> 00:00:10,761
AND THIS COULD BE IT.

6
00:00:10,844 --> 00:00:12,387
SO BECOMING CHRISTIAN

7
00:00:12,471 --> 00:00:14,556
HAS NOTHING TO DO
WITH SAINT LUKE?

YOU TOLD ME YOU WANNA
BECOME CHRISTIAN.

13
00:00:24,525 --> 00:00:26,360

16

TO THINK IT OVER...
