EVERY SECOND WITH HER.

137
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:07,266
BECAUSE FAMILY'S
IMPORTANT.

I NEED YOUR HELP.

145
00:05:53,729 --> 00:05:54,938
I'M NO GOOD AT CALCULUS,
ALLI.

146
00:05:55,022 --> 00:05:56,773
NO, THIS ISN'T
ABOUT HOMEWORK.

147
00:05:56,857 --> 00:05:57,316
I NEED TO GET THAT TICKET

148
00:05:57,399 --> 00:05:58,192

150
00:05:59,109 --> 00:06:00,652
UH... TWO.

151

UGH! GO TO BED.

152
00:06:02,487 --> 00:06:02,988
YOU'VE BARELY SLEPT

153
00:06:03,071 --> 00:06:03,655
AREN'T YOU TIRED?

154
00:06:03,739 --> 00:06:05,324
NOT EVEN A LITTLE.

155
00:06:05,407 --> 00:06:06,450
BESIDES, THERE'S NO WAY
I CAN SLEEP

156
00:06:06,533 --> 00:06:06,909
UNTIL I GET THAT
TICKET BACK.

157
00:06:06,992 --> 00:06:08,160
I NEED A PLAN.

158
00:06:08,243 --> 00:06:09,745
TRY SOME WARM MILK.

159
00:06:09,828 --> 00:06:11,121
(HUFFS, AGITATED)
THAT'S NOT HELPING.

160
00:06:11,205 --> 00:06:13,373
I COULD WHACK YOU
ON THE HEAD.

161
00:06:13,457 --> 00:06:15,083
NO! I DON'T NEED A PLAN.

162
00:06:15,167 --> 00:06:15,918
I'M JUST GONNA GO
OVER THERE

163
00:06:16,001 --> 00:06:17,920
AND NOT TAKE NO
FOR AN ANSWER!

164
00:06:18,003 --> 00:06:19,713
YOU CAN'T JUST WALK OVER
TO THE TORRES' AT 2 AM.

165
00:06:19,796 --> 00:06:21,298
IT'S DANGEROUS.

166
00:06:21,924 --> 00:06:24,718
WELL, THEN I'M LUCKY
I HAVE A CAR.

167
00:06:29,806 --> 00:06:31,308
(BANGING ON DOOR)

168

00:06:47,699 --> 00:06:50,035
WAIT,
IS THIS A BOOTY CALL?

172
00:06:50,118 --> 00:06:51,828
UGH! NO, THIS ISN'T
A BOOTY CALL!

173
00:06:51,912 --> 00:06:55,123
SSSHHHH!
YOU'LL WAKE THE TORRES'.

174
00:06:55,207 --> 00:06:57,167
WHATEVER IT IS,
CAN IT JUST WAIT TILL TOMORROW?

175
00:06:57,251 --> 00:06:58,794
NO! I AM NOT GOING ANYWHERE
WITHOUT THAT JAY-Z TICKET.

176
00:06:58,877 --> 00:07:01,171
BECAUSE CLARE DOESN'T

00:13:16,755 --> 00:13:18,257
I JUST...
I NEED A MOM...

349
00:13:21,593 --> 00:13:23,095
ESPECIALLY TODAY.

350
00:13:24,888 --> 00:13:26,390
WHY?
DID SOMETHING HAPPEN?

351
00:13:29,393 --> 00:13:31,520
FIONA:
IMOGEN AND I HAD A FIGHT.

352
00:13:31,603 --> 00:13:35,399
SHE ACCUSED ME
OF TRYING TO STEAL HER MOM.

353
00:13:35,482 --> 00:13:38,569
WHY IS SHE SO THREATENED
BY THE THREE OF US HANGING OUT?

354
00:13:38,652 --> 00:13:39,903
MRS. COYNE:
MM, PROBABLY FOR
THE SAME REASON YOU WERE MAD

355
00:13:39,987 --> 00:13:42,614
WHEN HOLLY J AND I
GOT ALONG.

356
00:13:42,698 --> 00:13:44,199
I WAS SO JEALOUS.

357
00:13:45,993 --> 00:13:47,244
I WANTED YOU
TO LIKE ME BETTER.

358
00:13:47,327 --> 00:13:48,996
OH! LIKE I EVER DIDN'T.

359
00:13:51,915 --> 00:13:52,499
YOU NEED TO GIVE IMOGEN
AND HER MOM

360
00:13:52,583 --> 00:13:55,085
SOME TIME TOGETHER.

361
00:13:55,169 --> 00:13:57,212
THEY PROBABLY HAVE A LOT
OF THINGS TO WORK OUT...

362
00:13:57,296 --> 00:13:58,797
AND IT'S NOT GONNA
BE EASY.

363
00:14:00,591 --> 00:14:02,551
IT CERTAINLY WASN'T
FOR US.

364
00:14:02,634 --> 00:14:04,261
STILL ISN'T SOMETIMES.

365
00:14:07,723 --> 00:14:09,224
I MISS YOU, MOM.

366
00:14:10,601 --> 00:14:12,561
I MISS YOU TOO,
FIFI,

367
00:14:12,644 --> 00:14:14,146
MORE THAN YOU KNOW.

368
00:14:15,689 --> 00:14:17,191

MR. BHANDARI:
STILL HERE?

371
00:14:28,493 --> 00:14:31,079
WILL YOU NOT BE LATE
FOR JAY-Z?

372
00:14:31,163 --> 00:14:34,291
I JUST HAVE TO FINISH
MY CALCULUS ASSIGNMENT.

373
00:14:34,374 --> 00:14:35,792
MR. BHANDARI:
REMEMBER, YOU ARE THE ONLY ONE
INSURED TO DRIVE YOUR CAR.

374
00:14:35,876 --> 00:14:38,086
GOT IT, DAD.

375
00:14:38,170 --> 00:14:39,671
YOUR MOTHER AND I ARE
SO PROUD OF YOU.

376
00:14:39,755 --> 00:14:41,089
YOU HAVE GROWN UP

377
00:14:41,173 --> 00:14:43,383
INTO SUCH A RESPONSIBLE
YOUNG GIRL!

378
00:14:43,467 --> 00:14:44,384
LOVE YOU.

379
00:14:44,468 --> 00:14:45,969
LOVE YOU.

380
00:14:49,014 --> 00:14:50,224
JENNA:
MAYBE YOU SHOULD TAKE A NAP
BEFORE THE CONCERT.

381
00:14:50,307 --> 00:14:51,808
ALL I NEED IS COFFEE.

382
00:14:53,393 --> 00:14:57,147
BESIDES, IF I LET MYSELF SLEEP,
I'LL NEVER WAKE UP.

383
00:14:57,231 --> 00:14:59,858
AND I HAVE WORKED WAY TOO HARD
TO GET THIS ONE NIGHT OFF.

384
00:14:59,942 --> 00:15:01,443
I AM NOT SLEEPING
THROUGH IT!

385
00:15:04,738 --> 00:15:06,240
(SIGHS)
DON'T WAIT UP!

386
00:15:09,034 --> 00:15:10,827
(YAWNING)

387
00:15:10,911 --> 00:15:11,954
FIONA:
DON'T PEEK!

388
00:15:12,037 --> 00:15:12,788
IMOGEN:
OKAY, IT'S HARD!

389
00:15:12,871 --> 00:15:14,498
(FIONA LAUGHS)

390
00:15:14,581 --> 00:15:16,667
IMOGEN:
FIONA, I LOVE SURPRISES,

391
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:18,919
BUT SO FAR WE'VE WALKED
INTO A TABLE,

392
00:15:19,002 --> 00:15:21,421
TWO CHAIRS,

393
00:15:21,505 --> 00:15:23,423
UM, WHAT I THINK
WAS A TODDLER...

394
00:15:23,507 --> 00:15:25,008
SURPRISE!

395
00:15:30,556 --> 00:15:33,058
IMOGEN:
YOU'RE DOING MORE RENOVATIONS?

396
00:15:33,141 --> 00:15:35,394
NO, THESE ARE THE PLANS
FOR YOUR BEDROOM.

397
00:15:35,477 --> 00:15:36,520
AND THEY'RE AT THE MALL
BECAUSE...?

398
00:15:36,603 --> 00:15:39,273

FIONA TOLD ME
WHAT A GREAT JOB YOU DID

400
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,860
ON THE SETS
FOR THE MUSICAL.

401
00:15:42,943 --> 00:15:45,028
I WAS HOPING...
MAYBE YOU HAD SOME IDEAS.

402
00:15:45,112 --> 00:15:46,613
ME?

403
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:50,117
WE COULD WORK ON IT
TOGETHER.

404
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,159
BUT ALL YOU'VE DONE
IS COMPLAIN

405
00:15:51,243 --> 00:15:53,078
ABOUT THIS RENOVATION.

406
00:15:53,161 --> 00:15:55,205
I'VE FELT LIKE SUCH
A HUGE BURDEN.

407
00:15:55,289 --> 00:15:56,456
I KEPT YOU OUT
OF THE RENOVATION

408
00:15:56,540 --> 00:15:58,125
SO I WOULDN'T BURDEN YOU,

409
00:15:58,208 --> 00:16:00,419
NOT BECAUSE YOU WERE
A BURDEN, IMOGEN.

410
00:16:00,502 --> 00:16:02,504
IT'S YOUR ROOM,
I'D LOVE YOUR HELP.

411
00:16:04,298 --> 00:16:05,799
JUST SAY YES ALREADY!

412
00:16:07,676 --> 00:16:10,721
YEAH! (LAUGHS)
YEAH!

413
00:16:10,804 --> 00:16:13,056
MY BRAIN IS LITERALLY
OVERFLOWING WITH IDEAS!

414
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:15,350
I CANNOT WAIT TO BUILD
A MINI MODEL!

415
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:18,061
(INHALES SHARPLY)
YOU DID THIS.

416
00:16:18,145 --> 00:16:19,104
THANK YOU.

417
00:16:19,188 --> 00:16:20,689
YOU'RE WELCOME.

418
00:16:25,277 --> 00:16:26,987
IMOGEN:
UM... YOU'RE NOT STAYING
TO HELP?

419
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:29,281
ACTUALLY, I'VE GOT A BUS
TO CATCH.

420

421
00:16:30,908 --> 00:16:32,826

422
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:34,411

YOU READY?

426
00:16:58,810 --> 00:17:02,314

OKAY,
NOW LUNGE FORWARD.

431
00:17:10,364 --> 00:17:11,907
THEN RAISE YOUR ARMS
OVER YOUR HEAD,

432
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:13,492
AND BREATHE.

433
00:17:15,619 --> 00:17:17,579

RIHANNA ON.

THAT I WASN'T HURT.

501
00:20:37,196 --> 00:20:38,447
AND I SHOULD HAVE BEEN HOME
SLEEPING,

502
00:20:38,530 --> 00:20:40,741

SOME FUN IN MY LIFE.

FROM SO MUCH WORK.

I HAVEN'T BEEN SLEEPING

507
00:20:58,759 --> 00:21:00,177
BECAUSE I'VE BEEN
TAKING UPPERS.

WITH ADHD.

BUT THAT'S THE ONLY WAY

512
00:21:07,726 --> 00:21:09,561
I COULD'VE GOTTEN
ALL THAT WORK DONE.

513
00:21:09,645 --> 00:21:11,355
I THOUGHT, WITH M.I.T,

514
00:21:11,438 --> 00:21:13,190
YOU WERE FINALLY ON
THE RIGHT TRACK.

515
00:21:13,273 --> 00:21:15,275
I KNOW, AND M.I.T'S ALWAYS
BEEN MY DREAM,

516
00:21:15,359 --> 00:21:17,778
AND THE RESEARCH PROGRAM
I GOT INTO

517
00:21:17,861 --> 00:21:21,406
IS TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE,
BUT...

518
00:21:21,490 --> 00:21:25,118
I DON'T KNOW IF I MADE
THE RIGHT DECISION.

519
00:21:25,202 --> 00:21:27,496
MAYBE I'M NOT READY
TO FAST-TRACK.

520
00:21:30,958 --> 00:21:33,836
MAYBE I SHOULD JUST DO
MY LAST YEAR OF HIGH SCHOOL.
