SET UP THE REST OF THE TABLES.

349
00:15:56,248 --> 00:15:58,125
UM, CAN I HAVE YOUR ATTENTION
PLEASE?

350
00:15:58,208 --> 00:15:59,793
I JUST FOUND OUT
THAT LES PERDRIX

351
00:15:59,877 --> 00:16:00,669
WON'T BE ABLE TO PERFORM.

352
00:16:00,752 --> 00:16:02,254
I'M SORRY.

353
00:16:06,675 --> 00:16:07,801
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

354
00:16:07,885 --> 00:16:09,386
YOU DO MUSIC.
WHAT?

355
00:16:11,847 --> 00:16:13,765
THINK OF HOW HAPPY
MADAME WOULD BE IF YOU SANG.

356
00:16:13,849 --> 00:16:15,559
YOU'D BE HER HERO.
NAPOLEON.

357
00:16:15,642 --> 00:16:17,144
(SIGHS)

358
00:16:19,396 --> 00:16:20,898
YOU'RE RIGHT;

359
00:16:21,982 --> 00:16:23,483
I OWE IT TO MADAME.

360
00:16:34,286 --> 00:16:35,579
YOU CAME!

361
00:16:35,662 --> 00:16:37,206
TO TALK,
NOT TO LISTEN.

362
00:16:38,874 --> 00:16:40,459
YOU WERE SO EASY

363
00:16:40,542 --> 00:16:42,252
WHEN EVERYTHING ELSE
WAS COMPLICATED.

364
00:16:42,336 --> 00:16:44,796
AND NOW, WHEN YOUR EX-GIRLFRIEND
WALKS IN...

365
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:46,381
I DON'T WANNA FEEL UPSET,

366
00:16:46,465 --> 00:16:48,050
OR DISAPPOINTED,
OR ANYTHING,

367
00:16:48,133 --> 00:16:50,636
BECAUSE WE'RE JUST FRIENDS.

368
00:16:50,719 --> 00:16:52,221
THAT'S IT.
THE END.

369
00:16:56,225 --> 00:16:57,726
YOU MAY SPEAK.

370
00:16:58,977 --> 00:17:00,354
ME AND VANESSA ARE DONE.

371
00:17:00,437 --> 00:17:01,688
(SCOFFS)
HERE WE GO...

372
00:17:01,772 --> 00:17:03,899
NO, SERIOUSLY.

373
00:17:03,982 --> 00:17:06,568
WE'VE BEEN DONE
FOR A LONG TIME, ALLI.

374
00:17:06,652 --> 00:17:09,863
LAST NIGHT WAS JUST A UH...
A MISUNDERSTANDING.

375
00:17:09,947 --> 00:17:11,865
IT'S ONLY YOU.

376
00:17:11,949 --> 00:17:13,408
I JUST GOT OVER DAVE.

377
00:17:13,492 --> 00:17:15,244
I AM NOT GONNA LET YOU
DO THIS TO ME.

378
00:17:15,327 --> 00:17:16,495
WHAT HAPPENED BETWEEN YOU
AND DAVE?

379
00:17:16,578 --> 00:17:18,080
(SIGHS)

380
00:17:20,249 --> 00:17:21,750
I THOUGHT I WAS PREGNANT.

381
00:17:23,293 --> 00:17:24,878
SCARY, HUH?

382
00:17:24,962 --> 00:17:26,463
YEAH. SUPER SCARY.

383
00:17:27,923 --> 00:17:30,926
CAN YOU IMAGINE BEING A MOM
AT SIXTEEN?

384
00:17:31,009 --> 00:17:32,386
SNOTTY LITTLE RUGRAT,

385
00:17:32,469 --> 00:17:34,304
RUNNING AROUND,
RIPPING UP MY CARPETS,

386
00:17:34,388 --> 00:17:34,847
WHILE I'M TRYING TO DO
MY TRIG HOMEWORK?

387
00:17:34,930 --> 00:17:36,431
NO THANK YOU.

388
00:17:37,975 --> 00:17:39,560
SORRY,
I'M RUMBLING.

389
00:17:39,643 --> 00:17:41,144
WHY DID YOU WANNA
SEE ME?

390
00:17:41,895 --> 00:17:43,397
OH, YEAH. UM...

391
00:17:44,481 --> 00:17:45,983
(SIGHS)

392
00:17:47,359 --> 00:17:48,861
(CHUCKLES)

393
00:17:53,365 --> 00:17:54,867
(SIGHS)

394
00:17:57,202 --> 00:17:58,704
ALLI:
(LAUGHS) CHRISTMAS LIGHTS?

395
00:18:00,998 --> 00:18:02,332
I WAS TRYING TO GO
FOR MORE "ROMANTIC,"

396
00:18:02,416 --> 00:18:03,709
BUT THIS IS ALL
THAT WAS IN THE CUBBY.

397
00:18:03,792 --> 00:18:05,294
(LAUGHS)

398
00:18:07,963 --> 00:18:09,214
I'M NOT GONNA KISS YOU.

399
00:18:09,298 --> 00:18:10,799
PRESUMPTUOUS!

400
00:18:10,883 --> 00:18:11,717
COME ON,
YOU WERE THINKING IT.

401
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,385
EVEN IF I WAS...
WHY NOT?

402
00:18:16,305 --> 00:18:18,557
I WANNA DO THIS RIGHT.

403
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,350
I WANNA SAVE IT
FOR OUR FIRST OFFICIAL DATE.

404
00:18:20,434 --> 00:18:21,435
WHAT DO YOU SAY?

405
00:18:21,518 --> 00:18:22,644
DRAMA NOT INCLUDED?

406
00:18:22,728 --> 00:18:24,605
NO DRAMA.
PERFECT.

407
00:18:24,688 --> 00:18:26,190
(CHUCKLING)

408
00:18:30,736 --> 00:18:32,237
(KEYS JINGLE,
DOOR SHUTS)

409
00:18:33,697 --> 00:18:35,199
(LIGHTS CLICK ON)

410
00:18:40,579 --> 00:18:42,080
(GLASS CLINKS)

411
00:18:42,581 --> 00:18:44,082
FIONA:
WHAT THE...?

412
00:18:53,425 --> 00:18:54,927
(MUFFLED SCREAMS)

413
00:18:55,802 --> 00:18:57,262
HOODED FIGURE:
SEE THIS?

414
00:18:57,346 --> 00:18:58,430
KNOW WHAT IT DOES?

415
00:18:58,514 --> 00:19:00,015
(SHAKY BREATHS)

416
00:19:02,059 --> 00:19:03,268
HOODED FIGURE:
KNEEL ON THE FLOOR.

417
00:19:03,352 --> 00:19:04,394
FIONA:
T-TAKE WHATEVER YOU WANT.

418
00:19:04,478 --> 00:19:06,688
HOODED FIGURE:
GET. ON. YOUR KNEES.

419
00:19:06,772 --> 00:19:08,857
(CRYING)

420
00:19:08,941 --> 00:19:11,068
COVER YOUR EYES.

421
00:19:11,151 --> 00:19:12,653
COUNT TO THIRTY.

422
00:19:17,032 --> 00:19:20,953
FIONA:
(SHAKILY)
ONE... TWO... THREE...

423
00:19:24,748 --> 00:19:27,543
AND WHEN I OPENED MY EYES,
HE WAS GONE.

424
00:19:27,626 --> 00:19:30,337
HE LEFT WHILE
YOU WERE COUNTING?

425
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:31,964
WAS IT AT TEN?
FIFTEEN? TWENTY?

426
00:19:34,091 --> 00:19:35,926
MY EYES WERE CLOSED.
I DON'T KNOW.

427
00:19:36,009 --> 00:19:36,927
FEMALE OFFICER:
WHEN HE GRABBED YOU,

428
00:19:37,010 --> 00:19:37,511
WHICH DIRECTION DID HE COME
FROM?

429
00:19:37,594 --> 00:19:39,221
I DON'T KNOW.

430
00:19:39,304 --> 00:19:40,430
WHEN YOU CAME HOME,
WAS THE DOOR LOCKED?

431
00:19:40,514 --> 00:19:41,557
I UNLOCKED IT.

432
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:43,141
ARE YOU SURE?

433
00:19:43,225 --> 00:19:46,186
I PUT MY KEY
IN THE LOCK...

434
00:19:46,270 --> 00:19:47,145
FEMALE OFFICER:
BUT YOU CAN'T SAY FOR SURE
THAT YOU UNLOCKED THE DOOR.

435
00:19:47,229 --> 00:19:48,730
I DON'T KNOW!

436
00:19:51,525 --> 00:19:52,484
FEMALE OFFICER:
DID ANYBODY KNOW YOUR APARTMENT
WAS GOING TO BE EMPTY?

437
00:19:52,568 --> 00:19:53,735
JUST MY GIRLFRIEND,

438
00:19:53,819 --> 00:19:56,989
BUT I TRUST HER
WITH MY LIFE.

439
00:19:57,072 --> 00:19:57,739
FEMALE OFFICER:
YOU DIDN'T TELL
ANYBODY ELSE?

440
00:19:57,823 --> 00:19:59,324
NO!

441
00:20:04,079 --> 00:20:06,874
I TWEETED THAT
I WAS GONNA BE AT WORK, BUT...

442
00:20:06,957 --> 00:20:08,458
BUT YOU DON'T THINK
THAT...

443
00:20:10,502 --> 00:20:12,796
THERE'S NO WAY OF KNOWING
FOR SURE.

444
00:20:17,384 --> 00:20:18,886
THANK YOU.

445
00:20:21,096 --> 00:20:22,556
IMOGEN:
GOD, FIONA, ARE YOU OKAY?

446
00:20:22,639 --> 00:20:24,474
YEAH, I'M OKAY...

447
00:20:24,558 --> 00:20:26,310
BUT NO, NOT AT ALL.

448
00:20:30,689 --> 00:20:33,025
MY LAPTOP.
I NEED MY LAPTOP.

449
00:20:33,108 --> 00:20:34,610
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

450
00:20:46,288 --> 00:20:49,541
STOLEN. OF COURSE.

451
00:20:49,625 --> 00:20:51,293
IMOGEN:
HERE. YOU CAN USE MINE.

452
00:20:54,087 --> 00:20:56,465
THIS IS ALL MY FAULT.

453
00:20:56,548 --> 00:21:00,010
HOW IS THIS YOUR FAULT,
FIONA?

454
00:21:00,093 --> 00:21:02,638
I TWEETED THAT
I WAS GONNA BE AT WORK.

455
00:21:02,721 --> 00:21:05,015
ONE OF MY FOLLOWERS
KNEW I'D BE OUT.

456
00:21:05,098 --> 00:21:07,100
HE MUST HAVE FOLLOWED
THE GPS LOCATION

457
00:21:07,184 --> 00:21:09,311
OF ONE OF MY HOME TWEETS,
AND BROKE IN.

458
00:21:09,394 --> 00:21:10,437
I WAS SO DESPERATE
FOR STRANGERS' ATTENTION

459
00:21:10,521 --> 00:21:12,022
AND I GOT IT.

460
00:21:12,773 --> 00:21:14,107
I GOT WHAT I DESERVED.

461
00:21:14,191 --> 00:21:17,361
STOP IT, OKAY?
YOU'RE TALKING NONSENSE.

462
00:21:17,444 --> 00:21:19,863
THIS PROBABLY HAS NOTHING
TO DO WITH TWITTER.

463
00:21:19,947 --> 00:21:21,448
IT COULD'VE BEEN
ANYBODY.

464
00:21:21,532 --> 00:21:22,950
THAT MAKES ME FEEL
A LOT BETTER.

465
00:21:23,033 --> 00:21:23,992
DO YOU WANNA CALL
YOUR MOM?

466
00:21:24,076 --> 00:21:27,829
NO. NO WAY.
SHE'LL FREAK.

467
00:21:27,913 --> 00:21:28,580
AND SHE HAS ENOUGH PROBLEMS
RIGHT NOW,

468
00:21:28,664 --> 00:21:29,706
SHE DOESN'T NEED THIS TOO.

469
00:21:29,790 --> 00:21:31,291
ARE YOU SURE?

470
00:21:32,125 --> 00:21:33,627
YEAH.

471
00:21:35,796 --> 00:21:37,297
BESIDES, I HAVE YOU.

472
00:21:42,052 --> 00:21:43,554
DON'T EVER LEAVE,
OKAY?
