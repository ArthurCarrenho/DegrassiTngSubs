SI.

348
00:15:10,619 --> 00:15:12,204
SO THAT'S WHY YOU WANT ME
TO WORK FOR YOU?

349
00:15:12,287 --> 00:15:13,789
BECAUSE OF MY "CONNECTIONS"?

350
00:15:15,082 --> 00:15:17,334
SCUSI?

351
00:15:17,417 --> 00:15:19,336
(SIGHS)
I'M ONTO YOU, FEDERICO.

352
00:15:19,419 --> 00:15:21,588
YOU ITALIANS ARE
A SNEAKY BUNCH,

353
00:15:21,672 --> 00:15:22,965
AND DON'T EVEN GET ME
STARTED ON THE LIONS.

354
00:15:23,048 --> 00:15:25,801
MISS COYNE,
ARE YOU INEBRIATED?

355
00:15:25,884 --> 00:15:27,970
I THOUGHT YOU WOULD
NEVER OFFER.

356
00:15:34,268 --> 00:15:35,769
UM, CAN WE GET
ANOTHER GLASS?

357
00:15:39,189 --> 00:15:40,691
SO, TELL ME ABOUT
THE JOB...

358
00:15:42,234 --> 00:15:44,611
MA CHE COSA DICI?!

359
00:15:44,695 --> 00:15:46,697
I'VE NEVER SEEN
SUCH RUDE BEHAVIOUR.

360
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:48,532
OH! I'M THE RUDE ONE?

361
00:15:48,615 --> 00:15:50,284
YOU INTERRUPTED MY PROM
WITH MY GIRLFRIEND

362
00:15:50,367 --> 00:15:51,827
TO TALK ABOUT THIS
STUPID OPPORTUNITY,

363
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:53,120
SO LET'S TALK.

364
00:15:53,203 --> 00:15:54,705
OPPORTUNITY?

365
00:15:57,165 --> 00:15:59,626
THERE IS NO OPPORTUNITY
FOR YOU.

366
00:15:59,710 --> 00:16:02,880
IN FACT, I HOPE I NEVER LAY EYES
ON FIONA COYNE AGAIN

367
00:16:02,963 --> 00:16:04,464
IN MY LIFE.

368
00:16:05,048 --> 00:16:06,550
PORCA MISERIA.

369
00:16:09,428 --> 00:16:11,221
NOTHING WOULD MAKE ME HAPPIER.

(SATISFIED EXHALE)

371
00:16:17,895 --> 00:16:20,689
ANYA, THE HOTTEST GIRL,
WAS MY DATE LAST YEAR.

372
00:16:20,772 --> 00:16:22,399
THIS YEAR,
THREE NOT AS HOT GIRLS

373
00:16:22,482 --> 00:16:23,859
TURNED ME DOWN.

374
00:16:23,942 --> 00:16:25,444
THREE.

375
00:16:27,529 --> 00:16:29,781
THIS IS MY LAST NIGHT OUT
FOR A WHILE.

376
00:16:29,865 --> 00:16:31,700

I'M ON FULL-TIME DADDY DUTY.

377
00:16:35,412 --> 00:16:36,914

YOU KNOW WHAT'S NOT ROMANTIC?

384
00:16:57,935 --> 00:17:00,687
PAYING JAKE TO COME TO PROM
WITH US BEHIND MY BACK.

385
00:17:00,771 --> 00:17:02,439

THEY'RE JUST NOT WORTH IT.

386
00:17:04,525 --> 00:17:06,527
SEE? MARISOL DOESN'T GOTTA
PAY ANYONE TO BE MY FRIEND.

387
00:17:06,610 --> 00:17:08,737

YOU NEED TO STOP.

393
00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:32,970
CLARE, I WAS MESSED UP
AFTER CAM.

394
00:17:33,053 --> 00:17:35,097
I WASN'T THINKING.

395
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:37,975
BUT A DAY HASN'T GONE BY
I HAVEN'T MISSED YOU.

396

397
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:42,145
THEN WHY CAN'T YOU FORGIVE
AND FORGET?

398
00:17:42,229 --> 00:17:43,856
BECAUSE YOU BAILED ON ME!

399
00:17:48,569 --> 00:17:52,197
I'M A PRODUCTION ASSISTANT

00:17:52,281 --> 00:17:53,782
I LEAVE TOMORROW.

401

402
00:18:00,581 --> 00:18:05,252
SO WE ONLY HAVE
ONE NIGHT LEFT?

403
00:18:05,335 --> 00:18:06,837

SORRY I BAILED
FOR A BIT.

409
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:34,364
MY DAD SOUNDED REALLY WEIRD
ON THE PHONE

410
00:18:34,448 --> 00:18:35,532
SO I WENT TO GO
CHECK ON HIM.

411
00:18:35,616 --> 00:18:37,326
BUT IT WAS A FALSE ALARM.

412
00:18:37,409 --> 00:18:38,035
I THOUGHT YOU'D BE
HIDING OUT

413
00:18:38,118 --> 00:18:39,786
BECAUSE OF ITALY.

414
00:18:39,870 --> 00:18:42,831
TRUTH? I WISH THIS STUPID
OPPORTUNITY DIDN'T EXIST.

415
00:18:42,915 --> 00:18:44,124
WELL, I'M NOT SURE
THAT IT DOES.

416
00:18:44,208 --> 00:18:47,169
FEDERICO DIDN'T EVEN
CALL BACK.

417
00:18:47,252 --> 00:18:48,962
BUT I'M NOT GONNA LET IT
RUIN PROM.

418
00:18:51,632 --> 00:18:52,841
MAY I HAVE THIS DANCE?

MY PHONE IN YOUR PURSE?

421
00:18:58,263 --> 00:19:00,599
UM, YEAH, MINE DIED,
SO I BORROWED YOURS.

422
00:19:00,682 --> 00:19:01,642
WHO IS IT?

423
00:19:01,725 --> 00:19:03,810
MY MOM.

424
00:19:03,894 --> 00:19:05,187
CAN WE JUST LET IT RING?
I REALLY LOVE THIS SONG.

425
00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:06,313
NO. MAYBE SHE HEARD
FROM FEDERICO.

426
00:19:06,396 --> 00:19:08,315
I'LL MEET YOU
ON THE DANCE FLOOR, OKAY?

427
00:19:09,107 --> 00:19:10,609
HI, MOM.

428
00:19:18,784 --> 00:19:20,244
ELI:
WHO'D HAVE THUNK IT?

429
00:19:20,327 --> 00:19:21,703
THE GUY WHO USED TO DRIVE
A HEARSE

430
00:19:21,787 --> 00:19:22,955
AND DRESS ALL IN BLACK

431
00:19:23,038 --> 00:19:26,083
WOULD END UP PROM KING.

432
00:19:26,166 --> 00:19:28,752
I DON'T BELIEVE THAT
ALL THESE PEOPLE VOTED FOR US.

433
00:19:28,836 --> 00:19:32,089
ELI:
CORRECTION.
SOME OF THEM VOTED FOR US.

434
00:19:32,172 --> 00:19:33,674
I KNEW YOU RIGGED IT!
HOW?

435
00:19:36,218 --> 00:19:38,595
ELI:
LET'S JUST SAY
I OWE FIONA A HUGE FAVOUR.

436
00:19:39,346 --> 00:19:40,848
BUT IT WAS WORTH IT.

437
00:19:43,809 --> 00:19:47,813
SO WHAT DO THE KIDS DO
ON PROM NIGHT THESE DAYS?

438
00:19:48,355 --> 00:19:49,982
ELI:
OH, I DON'T KNOW...

439
00:19:50,065 --> 00:19:51,567
GET DRUNK.
GET A ROOM.

440
00:19:52,526 --> 00:19:54,027
HAVE SEX?

441
00:20:03,078 --> 00:20:04,580

444
00:20:10,502 --> 00:20:11,461
YOU NEED SOMETHING,
MORENO?

445
00:20:11,545 --> 00:20:12,713
YEAH. ADVICE.

446
00:20:12,796 --> 00:20:14,298
DREW'S MADE A LOT OF MISTAKES,
RIGHT?

447
00:20:14,381 --> 00:20:15,716
AND HE'LL PROBABLY MAKE
A LOT MORE.

448
00:20:15,799 --> 00:20:16,675
I'M RIGHT HERE.

449
00:20:16,758 --> 00:20:18,552

450
00:20:18,635 --> 00:20:20,095
A TERRIBLE,
TERRIBLE THING -

451
00:20:20,179 --> 00:20:22,055
AND WHEN FIONA FINDS OUT
SHE'LL NEVER FORGIVE ME.

452
00:20:22,139 --> 00:20:23,140
JUST TELL HER
THE TRUTH

453
00:20:23,223 --> 00:20:23,932
AND TELL HER
YOU'RE SORRY.

454
00:20:24,016 --> 00:20:25,559
THAT'S YOUR EXPERT ADVICE?!

455
00:20:25,642 --> 00:20:27,644
WHAT? LOVE CONQUERS ALL,
RIGHT, B?

456
00:20:27,728 --> 00:20:29,229
YOU'RE SUCH A SAP.

457
00:20:44,995 --> 00:20:46,872
HEY.

458
00:20:46,955 --> 00:20:48,665
YOU DIDN'T GO CHECK
ON YOUR DAD.

459
00:20:48,749 --> 00:20:51,627
NO.

460
00:20:51,710 --> 00:20:55,631
YOU IMPERSONATED ME
AT A MEETING WITH FEDERICO!

461
00:20:55,714 --> 00:20:57,674
FEDERICO JUST CALLED MY MOM
TO SAY THAT I WAS DRUNK.

462
00:20:57,758 --> 00:20:59,384
DO YOU KNOW
HOW WORRIED SHE WAS?

463
00:20:59,468 --> 00:21:01,345
PRETTY WORRIED,
I BET.

464
00:21:01,428 --> 00:21:02,554
HOW COULD YOU DO THIS?

465
00:21:02,638 --> 00:21:04,264
BECAUSE I DON'T WANT YOU
TO GO.

466
00:21:04,348 --> 00:21:05,682
KIND OF ROMANTIC, HUH.

467
00:21:05,766 --> 00:21:07,518
NO, IT WAS SELFISH
AND IMMATURE.

468
00:21:09,811 --> 00:21:11,480
YOU'RE THE ONE THAT MADE
ALL THESE PROMISES

469

ABOUT NEXT YEAR,

470
00:21:12,606 --> 00:21:13,690
THEN THE MOMENT YOU
GET A BETTER OFFER-

471
00:21:13,774 --> 00:21:15,567
I WAS BY YOUR SIDE
THROUGH EVERYTHING.

472
00:21:15,651 --> 00:21:17,236
IT'S JUST SOME STUPID JOB,
FIONA!

AND I EXPECT MY GIRLFRIEND
TO UNDERSTAND THAT.

475
00:21:21,114 --> 00:21:22,616
CAN'T WE JUST KISS
AND MAKE UP?

476
