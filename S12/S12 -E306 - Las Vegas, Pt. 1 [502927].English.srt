WELL, SHE CAN'T.
SHE'D STOP THE WEDDING.

96
00:03:20,659 --> 00:03:23,412
SHE THINKS B'S
TRAILER TRASH.

97
00:03:23,495 --> 00:03:24,830
I THINK THAT'S A BIT
OF AN EXAGGERATION.

98
00:03:24,913 --> 00:03:26,331

00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,350
ADAM?

108
00:03:45,434 --> 00:03:46,935
OH! DREW!

109
00:03:47,978 --> 00:03:50,856
LONG TIME, NO SEE.

113
00:03:55,444 --> 00:03:57,112
THANKS,
BUT I CAN START A FIRE.

114
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:00,574
WELL, WHAT IF IT RAINS?

115
00:04:00,657 --> 00:04:01,825
WELL, THEN I'LL FIGURE IT OUT.

116
00:04:01,909 --> 00:04:02,784

124
00:04:20,469 --> 00:04:21,929
SO PROUD.

125
00:04:22,012 --> 00:04:24,097
BUT...?

126
00:04:24,181 --> 00:04:26,016
NO MATTER HOW WE RUN
THE NUMBERS,

127
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:27,684
EVEN WITH FINANCIAL AID,

128
00:04:27,768 --> 00:04:29,269
A UNIVERSITY LIKE THIS
IS GONNA COST $20,000 A YEAR.

129
00:04:29,353 --> 00:04:31,271
EIGHTY FOR FOUR.

130
00:04:31,355 --> 00:04:33,065
OKAY, WELL,
WHAT IF I GOT A JOB?

131
00:04:33,148 --> 00:04:35,567
I COULD FLIP BURGERS
OR...

132
00:04:35,651 --> 00:04:38,403
A CRAPLOAD OF BURGERS.

133
00:04:38,487 --> 00:04:39,780
MRS. MATLIN:
WITH OUR MORTGAGE
AND MY MEDICAL BILLS...

134
00:04:39,863 --> 00:04:41,907
I KNOW.
IT WAS A PIPE-DREAM ANYWAY.

135
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:43,700
I'M SO SORRY,
SWEETIE-PIE.

136
00:04:43,784 --> 00:04:46,328
THERE'S NO WAY
WE CAN AFFORD THIS.

137
00:04:46,411 --> 00:04:48,038
IT'S OKAY, MOM.
I'LL JUST GO TO MEXICO

138
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:50,457
AND FORGET I EVEN APPLIED.

139
00:04:50,541 --> 00:04:51,416
YOU HAVE A GOOD TIME
ON YOUR TRIP, OKAY?

140
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,335
THANKS. SEE YOU.

141
00:04:53,418 --> 00:04:53,919
LOOK AFTER HER,
JAKE!

142
00:04:54,002 --> 00:04:55,504
I WILL.

143
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:04,972
HEY. HEY...

144
00:05:05,055 --> 00:05:06,515
SHE SAID THEY SAVED LIKE WHAT,
FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS

145
00:05:06,598 --> 00:05:08,058
FOR YOU TO STAY HOME
AND GO TO T.U.?

146
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:11,061
I MEAN, UNIVERSITY'S
UNIVERSITY, RIGHT?

147
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:13,230
YEAH. YOU KNOW,
LET'S JUST DROP IT.

148
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:14,314
I DON'T WANT THESE STUPID
MONEY PROBLEMS

149
00:05:14,398 --> 00:05:15,190
TO RUIN OUR SPRING BREAK.

150
00:05:15,274 --> 00:05:16,775
YEAH. OKAY.

151
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:21,029
DREW'S TWENTY MINUTES LATE!

152
00:05:21,113 --> 00:05:22,114
WHAT IF HE RAN INTO AUDRA

153
00:05:22,197 --> 00:05:23,407
AND SHE'S TALKING HIM
OUT OF IT?

154
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:24,992
I'M PINNING YOU.
STAY CALM.

155
00:05:25,784 --> 00:05:26,910
OH MY GOODNESS.

156
00:05:26,994 --> 00:05:29,037
WHAT?
WHAT HAPPENED?

157
00:05:29,121 --> 00:05:30,622
YOU MAKE SUCH
A BEAUTIFUL BRIDE!

158
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:34,459
THANK YOU, BUT...

159
00:05:34,543 --> 00:05:36,128
I WON'T BE CALM
UNTIL WE'RE ON THAT PLANE,

160
00:05:36,211 --> 00:05:37,629
AWAY FROM ALL THE AUDRAS
AND KATIES,

161
00:05:37,713 --> 00:05:39,047
AND ALL OF THE HATERS

162
00:05:39,131 --> 00:05:39,756
WHO'VE EVER TRIED
TO COME BETWEEN US.

163
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,925
RELAX.

164
00:05:42,009 --> 00:05:44,303
I TOLD EVERYONE THE FLIGHT WAS
20 MINUTES EARLIER THAN IT IS.

165
00:05:44,386 --> 00:05:46,597
WE'LL MAKE IT,
WITH TIME TO SPARE.

166
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,390
I AM SO GLAD WE MADE YOU
OUR WEDDING PLANNER.

167
00:05:48,473 --> 00:05:50,350
YOU'RE LIKE A
"BORING DETAILS" GENIUS.

168
00:05:51,935 --> 00:05:53,437
(LAUGHING)

169
00:05:54,897 --> 00:05:56,398
(PLANE ENGINES ROAR)

170
00:05:58,567 --> 00:05:59,776
KATIE:
NO, NO, NO!

171
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:01,069
HOW CAN OUR FLIGHT
BE CANCELED?

172
00:06:01,153 --> 00:06:03,238
(GROANS)

173
00:06:03,322 --> 00:06:04,489
MO:
HURRICANE STEPHANIE
HIT THE GULF.

174
00:06:04,573 --> 00:06:06,950
NO FLIGHTS IN OR OUT
OF MEXICO.

175
00:06:07,034 --> 00:06:09,203
WELL, NOW WHAT?
A STAY-CATION?

176
00:06:09,286 --> 00:06:12,080
DOES ANYBODY HAVE
INLINE SKATES?

177
00:06:12,164 --> 00:06:14,416
KATIE:
NO, NO. WE'RE DEFINITELY
GOING SOMEWHERE, OKAY?

178
00:06:14,499 --> 00:06:17,211
WE JUST HAVE TO SWITCH
OUR FLIGHTS AND HOTELS.

179
00:06:17,294 --> 00:06:18,629
THEN WE JUST HAVE TO PICK
SOMEWHERE TO GO.

180
00:06:18,712 --> 00:06:20,214
MARISOL:
SO... PARIS?

181
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:22,925
THAT'S A FEW MORE PESOS
THAN PUERTA VALLARTA.

182
00:06:23,008 --> 00:06:24,468
VANCOUVER?

183
00:06:24,551 --> 00:06:26,053
WE CAN SEE THOSE TREES

184
00:06:26,136 --> 00:06:27,137
THAT ARE BIG ENOUGH
TO DRIVE CARS THROUGH!

185
00:06:27,221 --> 00:06:28,847
AND SPEND SPRING BREAK
IN THE RAIN?

186
00:06:28,931 --> 00:06:30,057

UH...

188
00:06:32,768 --> 00:06:34,269
WHAT ABOUT VEGAS?

189
00:06:35,729 --> 00:06:37,648
JAKE:
REALLY? WE'RE UNDERAGE,
WE CAN'T DO MUCH THERE.

190
00:06:37,731 --> 00:06:39,274
KATIE:
NO, NO, NO.

191
00:06:39,358 --> 00:06:41,443
THERE'S LIKE PAINTBALLING
AND ROLLER COASTERS.

192
00:06:41,527 --> 00:06:43,654
IT'S PRACTICALLY LIKE
A GIANT AMUSEMENT PARK THERE.

193
00:06:43,737 --> 00:06:45,531
PLUS THERE'S POOLS, AND SPAS,
AND SHOPPING.

194
00:06:45,614 --> 00:06:47,950
MMM...

195
00:06:48,033 --> 00:06:49,576

PLUS I MIGHT BE ABLE TO WIN
MY TUITION AT BLACKJACK.

196
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:50,953
SAY WHAT?

197
00:06:51,036 --> 00:06:52,746
KATIE:
OKAY, GUYS,

198
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:53,830
REMEMBER WHEN I LIKE RULED
THE BLACKJACK TABLE

199
00:06:53,914 --> 00:06:55,374
AT DEGRASSI'S VEGAS NIGHT?

200
00:06:55,457 --> 00:06:57,459
YEAH, YOU HAD CRAZY LUCK
THAT NIGHT.

201
00:06:57,543 --> 00:06:58,377
KATIE:
NO, BUT IT WASN'T CRAZY LUCK.

202
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:00,337
MY GRANDFATHER LIVED
IN RENO

203
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:01,880
AND HE WON A SMALL FORTUNE
COUNTING CARDS,

204
00:07:01,964 --> 00:07:02,923
AND HE TAUGHT ME.

205
00:07:03,006 --> 00:07:04,258
ISN'T THAT ILLEGAL?

206
00:07:04,341 --> 00:07:06,677
TECHNICALLY NO,

207
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:09,638
AND PLUS I HAVE LIKE FIVE HOURS
ON THE PLANE TO PRACTICE.

208
00:07:10,556 --> 00:07:12,057
COME ON, GUYS,

209
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:12,850
I GOT INTO THE SCHOOL

00:07:12,933 --> 00:07:15,143
AND I CAN'T AFFORD IT.

211
00:07:15,227 --> 00:07:17,187
OKAY, I KNOW...
I KNOW IT SOUNDS CRAZY,

212
00:07:17,271 --> 00:07:19,189

00:09:58,182 --> 00:09:59,683
WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT?

287
00:10:01,518 --> 00:10:02,936
I WAS TRYING TO MAKE THINGS
LESS WEIRD.

288
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:04,980

BIANCA:
OKAY, SO...

293

YOU WANT A BIG WEDDING,

294
00:10:12,821 --> 00:10:14,031
OR YOU DIDN'T WANT IT
TO BE WEIRD?

295
00:10:14,114 --> 00:10:15,616
I DON'T KNOW, OKAY?
I PANICKED.

YOU CAN DO FOR ME?

298
00:10:20,621 --> 00:10:21,330
LEAVE ME ALONE
