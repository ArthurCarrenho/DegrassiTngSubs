I'M NOT INTO HER.

THEN HOW DO YOU EXPLAIN

178
00:06:45,656 --> 00:06:47,616
CAN YOU SHUT UP
WITH THAT?!

179
00:06:47,699 --> 00:06:48,825
I COULD HAVE GOTTEN HER
IN TROUBLE.

180
00:06:48,909 --> 00:06:49,701
I COULD HAVE MESSED UP

182
00:06:52,204 --> 00:06:53,163

184
00:06:57,251 --> 00:06:59,503
DO YOU REALIZE THAT I TRIED
TO STEAL CAM'S GIRLFRIEND

185
00:06:59,586 --> 00:07:01,171

186

MAYA TOLD ME TO STOP,
BUT...

187
00:07:10,222 --> 00:07:11,723
OF COURSE,
I DIDN'T LISTEN.

188
00:07:13,851 --> 00:07:15,853
I HURT EVERYONE
THAT I CARE ABOUT.

189
00:07:18,021 --> 00:07:20,023
IF YOU WERE REALLY
SUCH A BAD GUY,

190

HOW'S THE ZOMBIE
APOCALYPSE?

349
00:15:02,945 --> 00:15:04,780
BUSY.

350
00:15:04,863 --> 00:15:06,448
BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY,
HOW ARE YOU?

351
00:15:06,532 --> 00:15:07,032
YOU MISSED ALL YOUR CLASSES
THIS MORNING,

352
00:15:07,115 --> 00:15:08,659
AND I TRIED CALLING.

353
00:15:08,742 --> 00:15:09,743
I HAD AN APPOINTMENT.

354
00:15:09,826 --> 00:15:11,870
OH.
WITH YOUR THERAPIST?

355
00:15:11,954 --> 00:15:13,789
AT THE GUN RANGE.

356
00:15:13,872 --> 00:15:15,207
I LEARNED HOW TO SHOOT.

357
00:15:15,290 --> 00:15:17,334
GUNS ARE SCARY.

358
00:15:17,417 --> 00:15:18,085
WELL, RIGHT NOW
IT'S THE ONLY THING

359
00:15:18,168 --> 00:15:20,003
THAT'LL MAKE ME FEEL SAFE.

360
00:15:20,087 --> 00:15:21,171
SO WHAT?
YOU'RE GONNA GO BUY A GUN?

361
00:15:21,255 --> 00:15:22,297
YOU DON'T GET IT.

362
00:15:22,381 --> 00:15:24,091
ARE YOU HEARING YOURSELF?

363
00:15:24,174 --> 00:15:25,634
GUN, FIONA.
THEY SHOOT. KILL. DEAD.

364
00:15:25,717 --> 00:15:27,344
ILLEGAL. GUN.

365
00:15:27,427 --> 00:15:28,762
IT'S NOT LIKE
I HAVE ANYTHING ELSE.

366
00:15:28,846 --> 00:15:30,764
ELI:
AND CUT!

367
00:15:30,848 --> 00:15:32,349
IMOGEN,
TIMING ON THAT SCENE!

368
00:15:33,517 --> 00:15:34,852
ELI NEEDS YOU.

369
00:15:34,935 --> 00:15:36,770
I'LL FIGURE IT OUT
ON MY OWN.

370
00:15:40,899 --> 00:15:42,401
THANKS FOR COMING.

371
00:15:44,695 --> 00:15:46,947
YOU'RE PISSED;
THAT'S FAIR,

372
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:48,907
BUT I WANNA SHOW YOU
SOMETHING.

373
00:15:53,787 --> 00:15:55,873
I GOT ROCK HIS FAVOURITES.

374
00:15:55,956 --> 00:15:58,208
I GOT HIM TRUCKS, DINOSAURS,
BLOCKS.

375
00:15:58,292 --> 00:16:00,419
THERE'S EVEN A SPACE
FOR BOOKS.

376
00:16:00,502 --> 00:16:01,170
I WANT ROCKY TO FEEL
AT HOME,

377
00:16:01,253 --> 00:16:03,630
SO HE CAN VISIT MORE.

378
00:16:03,714 --> 00:16:05,966
HE'S GONNA LOVE IT,
RIGHT?

379
00:16:06,049 --> 00:16:08,093
LEAVING HIM WITH YOU
WAS A MISTAKE.

380
00:16:08,177 --> 00:16:10,179
IT WON'T HAPPEN AGAIN.

381
00:16:10,262 --> 00:16:11,972
DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY DATES
I'VE BEEN ON

382
00:16:12,055 --> 00:16:14,308
SINCE HE WAS BORN?

383
00:16:14,391 --> 00:16:14,850
I HAVE A FEELING
YOU'RE ABOUT TO TELL ME.

384
00:16:14,933 --> 00:16:16,435
NONE. NOT ONE.

385
00:16:17,227 --> 00:16:18,228
I GAVE UP EVERYTHING.

386
00:16:18,312 --> 00:16:20,314
I KNOW.

387
00:16:20,397 --> 00:16:21,899
AND BECAUSE OF YOU,
I GET TO PLAY HOCKEY

388
00:16:21,982 --> 00:16:22,900
AND I GET TO GO TO SCHOOL.

389
00:16:22,983 --> 00:16:24,610
ROCKY COULD'VE DIED!

390
00:16:27,404 --> 00:16:30,199
I MESSED UP, V.
I LET OUR BOY DOWN.

391
00:16:30,282 --> 00:16:31,700
I'M SORRY.

392
00:16:31,783 --> 00:16:32,618
JUST PLEASE TELL ME
WHAT TO DO,

393
00:16:32,701 --> 00:16:34,870
AND I'LL DO IT.

394
00:16:34,953 --> 00:16:36,455
LET ME BE A BETTER DAD.

395
00:16:39,875 --> 00:16:41,543
(CRYING)

396
00:16:47,799 --> 00:16:49,301
(DOOR SLAMS SHUT)

397
00:16:50,010 --> 00:16:51,512
(TAXI RUMBLES OFF)

398
00:16:54,806 --> 00:16:56,308
(LOW HUM OF CHATTER)

399
00:16:59,102 --> 00:17:00,604
(TRAIN HORN BELLOWS
IN THE DISTANCE)

400
00:17:12,032 --> 00:17:13,575
FIONA:
HEY.

401
00:17:13,659 --> 00:17:15,077
HEY.

402
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:16,662
I UH...
I NEED A GUN.

403
00:17:19,206 --> 00:17:20,791
WELL,
I NEED A MILLION DOLLARS.

404
00:17:20,874 --> 00:17:22,376
(OTHER THUGS LAUGH)

405
00:17:25,796 --> 00:17:27,297
WAIT.

406
00:17:28,006 --> 00:17:29,508
YOU SERIOUS?

407
00:17:31,093 --> 00:17:32,970
YOU GOT CASH?

408
00:17:33,053 --> 00:17:34,304
YEAH, I HAVE
LIKE $300

409
00:17:34,388 --> 00:17:36,640
THUG:
WHOA. NO, NO, NO.

410
00:17:36,723 --> 00:17:38,225
JUST, UH, FOLLOW ME.

411
00:17:44,273 --> 00:17:46,900
YOU AFRAID OF THE DARK?
CUZ I CAN HOLD YOUR HAND.

412
00:17:47,568 --> 00:17:49,069
FIONA:
I'M GOOD. THANKS.

413
00:17:58,662 --> 00:18:00,372
FIONA:

414
00:18:00,455 --> 00:18:01,957
THUG:
YEAH, YEAH.

00:18:08,172 --> 00:18:09,590
(PANICKED BREATHS)

417
00:18:09,673 --> 00:18:12,259
THUG:
JUST GIVE ME THE MONEY,
BITCH!

418
00:18:12,342 --> 00:18:13,844
FIONA:

419
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:16,638
AGH!

420
00:18:16,722 --> 00:18:18,223
OOF!

421
00:18:19,266 --> 00:18:20,767
AGHHH!

422
00:18:21,685 --> 00:18:23,604
THUG:
DUDE, THAT'S ENOUGH!
LET'S GO!

423
00:18:23,687 --> 00:18:24,229
GO! GO!

424
00:18:24,313 --> 00:18:25,814
GO! GO!

425

(BREATHING HEAVILY)

426
00:18:31,570 --> 00:18:33,071
HELP! HELP ME PLEASE!

427
00:18:34,281 --> 00:18:35,574
SOMEBODY HELP ME!

428
00:18:35,657 --> 00:18:37,659

DALLAS:
HEY.

431
00:18:48,712 --> 00:18:50,214
HI.

432
00:18:52,466 --> 00:18:55,010
YOU HAVE EVERY RIGHT
TO BE PISSED AT ME.

433
00:18:55,093 --> 00:18:56,553
ALLI:
LOOK, I DON'T LIKE
THAT YOU LIED,

434
00:18:56,637 --> 00:18:59,389
BUT I GET WHY YOU DID.

435
00:18:59,473 --> 00:19:02,184
IN YOUR SHOES,
I MIGHT'VE DONE THE SAME.

436
00:19:02,267 --> 00:19:05,437
DALLAS:
I DON'T WANNA HIDE ROCKY
FROM ANYONE ANYMORE.

437
00:19:05,521 --> 00:19:08,232
I MIGHT EVEN GET HIS NAME
TATTOOED ON MY ARM.

438
00:19:08,315 --> 00:19:10,275
ALL CURSIVE WITH HIS PORTRAIT
IN BLACK AND WHITE?

439
00:19:10,359 --> 00:19:12,236
HMM. ON SECOND THOUGHT,
MAYBE NOT.

440
00:19:15,489 --> 00:19:17,366
SO... "ROCKY" LIKE
THE BOXING MOVIE?

441
00:19:19,493 --> 00:19:22,162
IT'S ACTUALLY ROCK.
LIKE THE ROCK.

442
00:19:22,246 --> 00:19:24,164
OH! YOU NAMED YOUR SON
AFTER A WRESTLER?

443
00:19:24,248 --> 00:19:25,874
AND ACTOR.
DON'T JUDGE.

444
00:19:25,958 --> 00:19:27,459
(ALLI LAUGHS)

445
00:19:29,670 --> 00:19:31,171
SO... US.

446
00:19:34,550 --> 00:19:37,344
ALL I'VE WANTED FOR SO LONG
IS TO TAKE YOU ON A DATE.

447
00:19:37,427 --> 00:19:38,345
BUT YOU'VE GOT MORE
IMPORTANT THINGS.

448
00:19:38,428 --> 00:19:40,305
I GET IT.
YEAH.

449
00:19:40,389 --> 00:19:42,516
FROM NOW ON,
HE'S MY NUMBER ONE.

450
00:19:44,643 --> 00:19:46,144
(BELL RINGS)

451
00:19:49,356 --> 00:19:51,275
IMOGEN:
I'VE BEEN CALLING.

452
00:19:51,358 --> 00:19:51,942
I EVEN CAME TO YOUR PLACE
LAST NIGHT,

453
00:19:52,025 --> 00:19:53,485
AND NO ONE WAS THERE.

454
00:19:53,569 --> 00:19:55,070
WHAT HAPPENED?!

455
00:19:56,029 --> 00:19:59,783
UH, NOTHING.
I JUST... I TRIPPED,

456
00:19:59,867 --> 00:20:00,534
WHACKED MY FACE
ON THE COFFEE TABLE.

457
00:20:00,617 --> 00:20:02,119
SO CLUMSY!

458
00:20:02,911 --> 00:20:04,413
WHAT REALLY HAPPENED?

459
00:20:06,623 --> 00:20:08,125
FIONA,
I'M NOT STUPID.

460
00:20:15,257 --> 00:20:16,758
I WENT TO BUY A GUN...

461
00:20:18,677 --> 00:20:21,013
IN A SKETCHY AREA.

462
00:20:21,096 --> 00:20:22,890
SOME THUGS STOLE MY MONEY.

463
00:20:25,601 --> 00:20:27,769
I'M SO STUPID, IMOGEN.
I COULD'VE DIED.

464
00:20:27,853 --> 00:20:29,354
WELL, THANK GOD
YOU'RE OKAY.

465
00:20:30,731 --> 00:20:32,232
YOU'RE NOT MAD?

466
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:36,987
WHEN I REALIZED
HOW SCARED YOU WERE,

467
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:39,323
I TALKED TO MY MOM.

468
00:20:39,406 --> 00:20:41,033
SHE SAID YOU COULD COME
STAY WITH US.

469
00:20:41,116 --> 00:20:42,618
MOM'S, DAD'S -
WHEREVER I AM.

470
00:20:44,411 --> 00:20:46,038
YOU'RE NOT ALONE,
FIONA.

471
00:20:49,249 --> 00:20:50,918
THERE WAS A TIME
IN MY LIFE

472
00:20:51,001 --> 00:20:53,754
WHEN MY WORST FEAR IS
THAT I WOULD BE ALONE FOREVER.

473
00:20:53,837 --> 00:20:55,672
BUT LAST NIGHT,

474
00:20:55,756 --> 00:20:58,008
WHEN I WAS WAITING AROUND
IN THE HOSPITAL, ALONE,

475
00:20:58,091 --> 00:21:00,010
I HAD A LOT OF TIME
TO THINK.

476
00:21:01,512 --> 00:21:04,014
THIS PAST YEAR HAS BEEN
THE BEST OF MY LIFE.

477
00:21:04,097 --> 00:21:06,099
I HAVE THE BEST GIRLFRIEND
IN THE WORLD.

478
00:21:06,183 --> 00:21:06,975
I'M NOT GONNA LET
ONE BREAK-IN

479
00:21:07,059 --> 00:21:09,520
RUIN HOW FAR I'VE COME.

480
00:21:09,603 --> 00:21:11,271
I LOVE MY CONDO,

481
00:21:11,355 --> 00:21:13,524
AND I MIGHT STILL GET SCARED
SOMETIMES,

482
00:21:13,607 --> 00:21:15,234
BUT I HAVE TO KEEP
LIVING THERE.

483
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:18,362
IT'S MY HOME.

484
00:21:19,655 --> 00:21:21,615
