OKAY LOOK, SO YOU'VE PRODUCED
A PLAY BEFORE, RIGHT?

180
00:07:17,354 --> 00:07:19,648
AT MY OLD SCHOOL,
I RAN THE ENTIRE DRAMA CLUB.

181
00:07:19,731 --> 00:07:21,525
PLAYS ARE MY THING.

182
00:07:21,608 --> 00:07:24,111

186
00:07:27,823 --> 00:07:29,032
I WAS SO NERVOUS THAT NO ONE

187
00:07:29,116 --> 00:07:30,784
WOULD WANT TO WORK
UNDER THE NEW GIRL.

188
00:07:30,868 --> 00:07:32,661
W-WELL MAYBE WE COULD SEE IT
MORE AS A PARTNERSHIP.

189
00:07:32,744 --> 00:07:34,246

220
00:09:02,751 --> 00:09:03,335
I GUESS THIS ISN'T
GOING TO HELP ME

221
00:09:03,418 --> 00:09:05,546
GET OVER DREW AFTER ALL.

222
00:09:05,629 --> 00:09:07,130
I FEEL USED.

223
00:09:08,882 --> 00:09:10,759
I FEEL LIKE I'M NEVER
GONNA GET PAST THIS.

224
00:09:10,843 --> 00:09:12,344
UH, YOU JUST-

225
00:09:13,303 --> 00:09:15,097

227
00:09:18,851 --> 00:09:21,228
I REALLY NEED
TO DO SOMETHING.

228
00:09:21,937 --> 00:09:23,438
ANY BRILLIANT IDEAS?

229
00:09:24,356 --> 00:09:25,858
YEAH.

A BREAK-UP SELF-HELP BOOK.

YEAH, DON'T THINK I HAVEN'T
THOUGHT ABOUT THAT.

237
00:09:44,418 --> 00:09:45,919

I WAS OUT OF TOWN.

NO, WHEN I LEFT REHAB,

256
00:10:36,845 --> 00:10:39,223
MY THERAPIST TOLD ME
TO START A FRESH, NEW PATH.

257
00:10:39,306 --> 00:10:40,682
SHE SAID,
"THE WAY WILL BECOME CLEAR,"

258
00:10:40,766 --> 00:10:42,059
AND LAST NIGHT,
IT TOTALLY DID.

259
