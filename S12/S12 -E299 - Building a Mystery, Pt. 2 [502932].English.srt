THEN YOU CAN TALK
ABOUT MARRIAGE.

188
00:08:06,236 --> 00:08:07,988
NO. WE'RE STILL GETTING
MARRIED.

WE'RE IN LOVE.

190
00:08:12,367 --> 00:08:13,202

AFFECT OUR FUTURE.

LET ME SEE IT.

347
00:15:04,863 --> 00:15:06,740
NO!
I DELETED IT.

348
00:15:06,823 --> 00:15:08,116
NO ONE'S EVER SEEING THAT
PIECE OF JUNK EVER AGAIN.

349
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:10,744
YOU'RE OVERREACTING.

350
00:15:10,827 --> 00:15:11,662
IT'S THE WORST THING
I'VE EVER SEEN

351
00:15:11,745 --> 00:15:13,830
IN MY ENTIRE LIFE -
AND I MADE IT.

352
00:15:13,914 --> 00:15:14,915
YOU JUST OVER-THOUGHT IT,
THAT'S ALL.

353
00:15:14,998 --> 00:15:16,208
NO, I UNDER-THOUGHT IT.

354
00:15:16,291 --> 00:15:17,793
I DON'T FOLLOW.

355
00:15:19,044 --> 00:15:19,962
OKAY, I WAS FREAKING OUT
REALLY HARD

356
00:15:20,045 --> 00:15:21,463
THE OTHER NIGHT

357
00:15:21,547 --> 00:15:23,006
AND I DID SOMETHING REALLY,
REALLY STUPID...

358
00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:24,174
STUPIDER THAN CASTING
MY STEPBROTHER

359
00:15:24,258 --> 00:15:25,926
AS THE LEAD
IN YOUR SHORT FILM?

360
00:15:27,386 --> 00:15:29,596
I SMOKED WEED WITH JAKE.

361
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,014
YOU WHAT?
I KNOW - SO DUMB.

362
00:15:31,098 --> 00:15:32,474
I'M LUCKY
I DIDN'T GET CAUGHT.

363
00:15:32,558 --> 00:15:33,517
YOU'RE LUCKY IT DIDN'T
MESS WITH YOUR MEDS!

364
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,227
I PANICKED!

365
00:15:35,310 --> 00:15:38,063
I JUST WANTED
TO IMPRESS BRET.

366
00:15:38,146 --> 00:15:39,648
HE'S NEVER GONNA WRITE ME
THAT REFERENCE LETTER NOW.

367
00:15:39,731 --> 00:15:41,608
WAIT.
JAKE SMOKES MARIJUANA?!

368
00:15:41,692 --> 00:15:43,652
CLARE, FOCUS.

369
00:15:43,735 --> 00:15:45,153
IF I CAN'T FIGURE OUT
A TWO MINUTE SHORT,

370
00:15:45,237 --> 00:15:47,406
HOW AM I SUPPOSED
TO SURVIVE NYU?

371
00:15:47,489 --> 00:15:51,159
THE DIRECTING PROGRAM'S
REALLY TOUGH.

372
00:15:51,243 --> 00:15:53,620
WHAT IF ROMEO AND JULES
IS THE BEST THING I EVER DO?

373
00:15:53,704 --> 00:15:55,205
OKAY.

374
00:15:57,666 --> 00:15:59,877
WHAT DOES ALFRED SAY
TO BATMAN?

375
00:16:01,712 --> 00:16:04,464
WHY DO WE FALL DOWN,
MASTER WAYNE?

376
00:16:04,548 --> 00:16:06,508
SO WE CAN PICK OURSELVES
BACK UP.

377
00:16:08,552 --> 00:16:09,803
OKAY, BUT WHAT IF
I'M NOT GOOD ENOUGH?

378
00:16:09,887 --> 00:16:11,597
ELI,
YOU CAN DO ANYTHING.

379
00:16:13,432 --> 00:16:14,474
EVEN IF YOU DON'T
KNOW IT YET,

380
00:16:14,558 --> 00:16:16,059
I DO.

381
00:16:18,979 --> 00:16:20,397
C'MON, I KNOW SOMETHING
THAT'LL HELP.

382
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,982
THAT'S WHAT JAKE SAID.

383
00:16:23,567 --> 00:16:24,818
BECKY:

384

385
00:16:28,071 --> 00:16:30,574
NOW THE LIVE BIDDING
FOR THE BIG PRIZE:

387
00:16:31,992 --> 00:16:33,619
WHO WILL BE OUR LUCKY SEVEN?

388
00:16:33,702 --> 00:16:36,038
DO I HEAR ONE THOUSAND?

389
00:16:36,121 --> 00:16:37,706
I'M SORRY.

390
00:16:37,789 --> 00:16:39,333
I'VE BEEN OBSESSING
OVER YOUR MOM TOO MUCH.

391
00:16:39,416 --> 00:16:41,376
NO, I'M SORRY.
I GET IT.

392
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:42,211
SHE'S IMPORTANT TO YOU.

393
00:16:42,294 --> 00:16:43,795
NO.

394
00:16:45,422 --> 00:16:47,299
BECK:
ONE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED!
DO I HEAR TWO THOUSAND?

395
00:16:47,382 --> 00:16:49,092
YES, AND I SHOULD
HAVE LISTENED.

396
00:16:49,176 --> 00:16:50,052
IF YOU NEED AUDRA'S
APPROVAL-

397
00:16:50,135 --> 00:16:51,637
SCREW AUDRA!

407
00:17:14,201 --> 00:17:15,786
FIONA DOESN'T HAVE
THAT KIND OF MONEY.

408
00:17:15,869 --> 00:17:16,995
THAT'S WHY YOU NEED
TO WRITE HER A CHEQUE.

409
00:17:17,079 --> 00:17:19,248
WHAT?

410
00:17:19,331 --> 00:17:20,457
I DON'T WANNA WAIT
FIVE YEARS,

411
00:17:20,541 --> 00:17:22,584

I'M LEAVING NEXT YEAR,

447

TERRIFIED.

HOW'D YOU KNOW THAT?

451
00:19:59,408 --> 00:20:00,909
YOU JUST TOLD ME.

452
00:20:02,202 --> 00:20:03,871
SO SIMPLE,
SO EFFECTIVE.

453
00:20:05,664 --> 00:20:07,875
GOOD ENOUGH FOR NYU?

454
00:20:07,958 --> 00:20:10,544
I'M HOPING TO GO THERE
NEXT YEAR.

455
00:20:10,627 --> 00:20:12,588
THAT'S VERY COMPETITIVE.

456
00:20:12,671 --> 00:20:14,548
WELL, A REFERENCE LETTER

457
00:20:14,631 --> 00:20:17,801
FROM ONE OF ITS MOST SUCCESSFUL
ALUMNUS WOULD HELP.

458
00:20:17,885 --> 00:20:21,096
YEAH, I DON'T NORMALLY DO
THAT SORT OF THING.

459
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:22,890
IT'S OKAY.
I UNDERSTAND.

460
00:20:26,518 --> 00:20:28,103
BUT YOU TOOK MY CRITICISM
TO HEART,

461
00:20:28,187 --> 00:20:30,939
AND YOU CAME BACK
AND PROVED YOURSELF.

462
00:20:33,066 --> 00:20:35,110
I THINK NYU WOULD BE LUCKY
TO HAVE YOU.

463
00:20:35,194 --> 00:20:36,862
WOW. UH...

00:20:36,945 --> 00:20:37,946
THAT'S-THAT'S AMAZING!

465
00:20:38,030 --> 00:20:39,364
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY!

466
00:20:39,448 --> 00:20:43,076
PERHAPS IT'S BEST JUST TO QUIT

00:20:58,133 --> 00:21:00,302

FIFTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS

HOW ARE YOU?

474
00:21:06,975 --> 00:21:08,477
NOT WELL.

475
00:21:09,645 --> 00:21:11,146
A MESS, ACTUALLY.

476
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:18,737
I'VE DECIDED TO ACCEPT
MY PARENTS' HELP.

477
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:20,906
I'M GOING TO TRY
THE THERAPY.

478
00:21:20,989 --> 00:21:22,407
WHAT?!

479

I'M NOT.
I'M CONFUSED.

484
00:21:30,916 --> 00:21:32,417
YOU CONFUSED ME.

485
00:21:33,961 --> 00:21:36,547
IF THERAPY COULD WORK,
I HAVE TO TRY.

486
00:21:38,090 --> 00:21:39,216
IT'S FOR THE BEST.

487
00:21:39,299 --> 00:21:40,384
