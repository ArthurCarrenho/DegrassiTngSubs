00:07:36,707 --> 00:07:38,208
WE'LL SEE HOW THE NHL
LIKES THOSE.

179
00:07:38,292 --> 00:07:40,711

PLEASE DON'T! PLEASE!

180
00:07:40,794 --> 00:07:42,921
LOOK, I'M SORRY
ABOUT YESTERDAY.

181
00:07:43,005 --> 00:07:46,300
I WAS TRYING TO IMPRESS
THE GUYS AND...

182
00:07:46,383 --> 00:07:47,009
(TEARFUL)
NOW THEY THINK
I'M A HUGE LOSER.

183
00:07:47,092 --> 00:07:50,137
THEY'RE NOT WRONG.

184
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:53,223
HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO SURVIVE
A WHOLE SEASON HERE?

185
00:07:53,307 --> 00:07:57,269
I HAVE NO FRIENDS;
MY HOCKEY TEAM HATES ME;

186
00:07:57,352 --> 00:08:00,147
MY FAMILY IS THOUSANDS
OF MILES AWAY AND...

187
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:01,273
I'M CRYING
IN THE GIRLS' BATHROOM!

188
00:08:01,356 --> 00:08:02,858
OKAY, RELAX.

189
00:08:05,527 --> 00:08:08,280
AREN'T YOU SUPPOSED TO BE
LIKE THE TEAM HOT SHOT?

190
00:08:08,363 --> 00:08:09,948
(TEARFUL)
YEAH, I GUESS.

191
00:08:10,032 --> 00:08:12,492
WELL, THEN THE OTHER DUDES
ARE PROBABLY JUST JEALOUS.

192
00:08:12,576 --> 00:08:14,286
AND THAT'S WHY
THEY MAKE FUN OF ME?

193
00:08:14,369 --> 00:08:15,954
THEY MAKE FUN OF YOU
BECAUSE YOU LET THEM.

194
00:08:16,038 --> 00:08:17,831
IGNORE THEM.

195
00:08:17,915 --> 00:08:19,875
IN TWO YEARS,
YOU'RE GONNA BE IN THE NHL

196
00:08:19,958 --> 00:08:21,793
AND THEY'RE GONNA BE
MALL SECURITY GUARDS.

197
00:08:21,877 --> 00:08:23,962
THEN WE CAN ALL GO
HUCK GARBAGE AT THEM.

198
00:08:25,797 --> 00:08:26,882
OKAY, NOW GET OUTTA HERE

199
00:08:26,965 --> 00:08:29,426

205
00:08:47,736 --> 00:08:49,446

WHAT IF SIMPSON COMES UP
AND SEES YOUR DAD ISN'T HERE?

209
00:08:55,953 --> 00:08:58,705
WE'LL SAY HE WENT
FOR COFFEE.

210
00:08:58,789 --> 00:08:59,665
AND IF HE KEEPS
CHECKING ON US

211
00:08:59,748 --> 00:09:00,874
AND YOUR DAD'S
NEVER HERE?

212
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:02,334
I DON'T WANT
MY DAD'S HELP.

213
00:09:02,417 --> 00:09:03,710
I WANNA BUILD THIS GREEN ROOF

214
00:09:03,794 --> 00:09:06,171
AND PROVE TO HIM
THAT I KNOW WHAT I'M DOING.

215
00:09:09,007 --> 00:09:10,926
WELL, DO YOU KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE DOING?

216
00:09:11,009 --> 00:09:12,511
