00:00:02,002 --> 00:00:03,754
ADAM:
SPRING BREAK IS SO CLOSE
I CAN TASTE IT!

2
00:00:03,837 --> 00:00:05,172
IT TASTES SO GOOD!

3
00:00:05,255 --> 00:00:07,216
TWO MORE EXAMS
AND WE'RE DONE.

4
00:00:07,299 --> 00:00:09,343
SO HOW DID THE DATE GO
WITH MISSY?

5
00:00:09,426 --> 00:00:10,886
YOU'LL NEVER GUESS
WHAT HAPPENED.

6
00:00:10,969 --> 00:00:11,929
SO THEN WHY ARE YOU
MAKING ME GUESS?

7
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:14,515
'CAUSE IT'S FUN.

8
00:00:14,598 --> 00:00:17,142
I'LL GIVE YOU A HINT:
B-SQUARED.

9
00:00:17,226 --> 00:00:19,811
HA! TOO EASY.
BECKY BAKER.

10
00:00:19,895 --> 00:00:20,896
BUMPED INTO HER
YESTERDAY,

11
00:00:20,979 --> 00:00:21,480
SHE SAID SHE STILL
LIKES ME.

12
00:00:21,563 --> 00:00:23,524
NO!

13
00:00:23,607 --> 00:00:29,029
YES! AND SHE WROTE ME
THE CRAZIEST EMAIL.

14
00:00:29,112 --> 00:00:30,447
"EVERY TIME I GO
TO REPARATIVE THERAPY,

15
00:00:30,531 --> 00:00:33,283
IT ONLY REINFORCES
HOW MUCH I LOVE YOU."

16
00:00:33,367 --> 00:00:35,327
(EXHALES)
HEAVY STUFF.

17
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:37,204
RIGHT?
THAT GIRL DRIVES ME NUTS!

18
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:40,332
SO MISSY IT IS.

19
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:42,417
ACTUALLY,
I DON'T KNOW.

20
00:00:42,501 --> 00:00:43,961
NO, NO, NO, NO.

21
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:45,045
COME ON! YOU PROMISED
NO MORE BECKY.

22
00:00:45,128 --> 00:00:47,297
I KNOW IT'S CRAZY,

23
00:00:47,381 --> 00:00:48,131
BUT I FEEL LIKE
MY HEART'S SAYING

24
00:00:48,215 --> 00:00:49,258
TO GIVE HER
ANOTHER CHANCE.

25
00:00:49,341 --> 00:00:50,801
(BELL RINGS)

26
00:00:50,884 --> 00:00:52,386

I WAS TRYING
TO AVOID PUKING.

49

OH, WHAT IS THIS?
EXAM STRESS,

50
00:01:55,532 --> 00:01:56,867
OR BATTLE OF THE BANDS
STRESS?

51
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:59,411
NEITHER.
TODAY IS THE APOCALYPSE.

52
00:01:59,494 --> 00:02:02,247
THE SKY IS FALLING
AND IT'S ALL MY FAULT.

53
00:02:02,331 --> 00:02:03,874
OH, CHICKEN LITTLE,
WHAT DID YOU DO?

54
00:02:03,957 --> 00:02:04,583
YOU KNOW HOW I BROKE UP
WITH CAM

55
00:02:04,666 --> 00:02:05,667
FOR LIKE FIVE MINUTES

56
00:02:05,751 --> 00:02:07,294
AND KISSED ZIG?

57
00:02:07,377 --> 00:02:08,795
YOUR FINEST MOMENT.

58
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:10,714
YEAH. YAY ME!

59
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:12,758
WELL, NOW ZIG'S BREAKING UP
WITH TORI

60
00:02:12,841 --> 00:02:13,800
AFTER BATTLE OF THE BANDS
BECAUSE HE LIKES ME,

61
00:02:13,884 --> 00:02:15,552
AND I HAVE TO STOP HIM.

62
00:02:15,636 --> 00:02:17,137
UH, NO YOU DON'T.

63
00:02:17,221 --> 00:02:18,555
IF ZIG DOESN'T LIKE
TORI ANYMORE,

64
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:20,098
THERE'S NOTHING
YOU CAN DO.

65
00:02:20,182 --> 00:02:20,682
HE'S ACTUALLY DOING
THE RIGHT THING

66
00:02:20,766 --> 00:02:22,059
BY BEING HONEST.

67
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:23,685
BUT I DON'T WANNA
LOSE CAM.

68
00:02:23,769 --> 00:02:24,895
SHOULD I BE HONEST
AND TELL HIM ABOUT THE KISS?

69
00:02:24,978 --> 00:02:27,022
WHAT YOU DID
IS IN THE PAST.

70
00:02:27,105 --> 00:02:27,898
I MEAN,
YOU WERE BROKEN UP.

71
00:02:27,981 --> 00:02:29,233
IT'S NOT WORTH
STRESSING OVER.

72
00:02:29,316 --> 00:02:31,026
JUST FOCUS ON EXAMS,

73
00:02:31,109 --> 00:02:32,402
WINNING BATTLE
OF THE BANDS,

74
00:02:32,486 --> 00:02:33,987
AND DRINK
YOUR DAMN YOGURT.

75
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:41,078
ALL RIGHT, TIME'S UP.
PENCILS DOWN.

76
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:43,247
TURN YOUR EXAMS OVER.

77
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:44,831
(PAPERS RUSTLE)

78
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:48,210
(STUDENTS BEGIN TO CHATTER)

79
00:02:53,131 --> 00:02:54,633
ADAM:
BECKY! HOW DID YOU DO?

80
00:02:56,718 --> 00:02:58,887
I CAN'T TALK ABOUT THIS
RIGHT NOW.

81
00:02:58,971 --> 00:03:00,472
ADAM:
COME HERE.

82
00:03:02,724 --> 00:03:04,810
SO I READ YOUR EMAIL.

83
00:03:04,893 --> 00:03:07,062
I HAD TO RETRIEVE IT
FROM MY DELETED ITEMS.

84
00:03:07,145 --> 00:03:08,814
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU DELETED ME.

85
00:03:08,897 --> 00:03:11,650
BECKY,
I MET ANOTHER GIRL.

86
00:03:11,733 --> 00:03:13,068
SHE DOESN'T CARE
THAT I'M TRANS.

87
00:03:13,151 --> 00:03:14,903
HER FAMILY'S OPEN-MINDED.

88
00:03:14,987 --> 00:03:15,946
WE BOTH LOVE INDIE POP.

89
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:17,531
INDEPENDENT POPULAR MUSIC?

90
00:03:17,614 --> 00:03:19,283
ISN'T THAT A BIT
OF AN OXYMORON?

91
00:03:19,366 --> 00:03:21,910
WHAT I'M TRYING
TO SAY IS,

92
00:03:21,994 --> 00:03:24,830
EVEN THOUGH THERE'S
THIS "PERFECT" GIRL,

93
00:03:24,913 --> 00:03:26,999
I CAN'T STOP THINKING
ABOUT YOU.

94
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:32,421
ADAM, I CAN'T TELL MY PARENTS
WE'RE TOGETHER.

95
00:03:36,258 --> 00:03:38,719
SO THIS WAS A COMPLETE
WASTE OF TIME.

96
00:03:40,846 --> 00:03:42,097
WHEN I WAS IN THERAPY,

97
00:03:42,181 --> 00:03:43,390
ALL I COULD THINK ABOUT

98
00:03:43,473 --> 00:03:45,517
IS HOW I WANNA BE
WITH YOU NOW.

99
00:03:45,601 --> 00:03:48,020
MY FAMILY IS COMPLICATED.

100
00:03:48,103 --> 00:03:49,605
WE CAN'T TELL THEM.

101
00:03:51,899 --> 00:03:53,400
AND THAT TELLS ME

102
00:03:53,483 --> 00:03:55,402
THAT YOU HAVE SOMETHING
TO BE ASHAMED OF.

103
00:04:05,996 --> 00:04:06,914
I MISSED YOU
THIS MORNING.

104
00:04:06,997 --> 00:04:08,248
HOW DID IT GO
WITH YOUR DAD?

105
00:04:08,332 --> 00:04:10,209
DID HE TAKE AWAY
THE TRUCK?

106
00:04:11,835 --> 00:04:13,337
(KEYS JINGLE)

107
00:04:14,338 --> 00:04:15,839
DID HE SET A CURFEW?

108
00:04:17,466 --> 00:04:20,177
OH NO, ARE THEY SENDING YOU
TO REHAB?

109
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:22,638
NO. DAD SAID I WASN'T ALLOWED
TO SMOKE WEED ANYMORE.

110
00:04:25,974 --> 00:04:27,309
YOUR PUNISHMENT
FOR SMOKING WEED

111
00:04:27,392 --> 00:04:28,685
IS NO MORE SMOKING WEED?

112
00:04:28,769 --> 00:04:29,811
SHOULDN'T YOU BE WORRIED
ABOUT YOUR EXAM

113
00:04:29,895 --> 00:04:30,854
INSTEAD OF THE PUNISHMENT
I GOT

114
00:04:30,938 --> 00:04:33,106
BECAUSE YOU THREW ME
UNDER THE BUS?

115
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:35,400
OKAY. DON'T MAKE THIS OUT
TO BE MY FAULT.

116
00:04:35,484 --> 00:04:36,735
YOU'RE THE ONE WHO GAVE ELI
WEED YESTERDAY.

117
00:04:36,818 --> 00:04:38,445
YOU STARTED THIS MESS.

118
00:04:38,529 --> 00:04:39,863
YEAH, BY TRYING TO HELP YOU
WITH YOUR STUPID PLAN

119
00:04:39,947 --> 00:04:41,281
TO GET HIM TO STAY
OVER LATER.

120
00:04:41,365 --> 00:04:43,116
AND NOW HE'S NOT ALLOWED
OVER AT ALL.

121
00:04:46,203 --> 00:04:47,955
IT'S TIME
FOR A FAMILY MEETING.

122
00:04:48,038 --> 00:04:49,122

YEAH.

152
00:05:53,437 --> 00:05:55,147
ALL RIGHT, WELL, I ADMIT
IT WAS MY MOM'S IDEA.

153
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:56,940
BUT I PICKED IT OUT,
SO...

154
00:05:59,484 --> 00:06:02,112
I HAVE TO BE HONEST
WITH YOU.

155
00:06:02,196 --> 00:06:03,822
WHEN WE WERE BROKEN UP,

156
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:06,992
I KISSED ZIG.

IN OUR HOUSE.

237
00:09:26,191 --> 00:09:28,151
TO BE CLEAR,

238
00:09:28,235 --> 00:09:30,320
A DOUBLE STANDARD
IS THE APPLICATION

239
00:09:30,404 --> 00:09:31,321
OF DIFFERENT SETS OF PRINCIPLES
FOR DIFFERENT PEOPLE

240
00:09:31,405 --> 00:09:33,782

00:09:33,866 --> 00:09:35,617
JAKE GETS THE TRUCK
WHENEVER HE WANTS.

242
00:09:35,701 --> 00:09:37,411
I'VE HAD MY LICENSE
FOR SIX MONTHS NOW

243
00:09:37,494 --> 00:09:40,289
WITH ZERO CAR ACCESS.

244
00:09:40,372 --> 00:09:41,415
JAKE HAS NO TIME LIMIT
ON HIS GUESTS,

245
00:09:41,498 --> 00:09:43,917
HE HAS NO CURFEW,

246
00:09:44,001 --> 00:09:46,712
AND HE SMOKED WEED
WITHOUT SERIOUS CONSEQUENCE.

247
00:09:46,795 --> 00:09:47,921
IT'S BLATANT SEXISM.

248
00:09:48,005 --> 00:09:49,423
I AGREE WITH YOU,
CLARE.

249
00:09:49,506 --> 00:09:50,966
AND NOW THAT
WE'RE A FAMILY,

250
00:09:51,049 --> 00:09:52,676
I THINK JAKE SHOULD SHARE
THE SAME RULES AS YOU.

ANYTHING BEFORE?

TO INTERVENE.

TO THE OTHER THINGS

266

THAN ELI!

YOU'RE BEING UPTIGHT.

269
00:10:24,166 --> 00:10:26,210

WHY DON'T YOU TELL ME
HOW YOU REALLY FEEL.

270
00:10:26,293 --> 00:10:27,211
GLENN:
OH, BELIEVE ME, YOU DON'T
WANT ME TO TELL YOU THAT.

271

HELEN:
HERE WE GO AGAIN.

YOU'RE ALWAYS
ON MY BACK, HELEN.

273
00:10:29,963 --> 00:10:31,006
JUST GET OFF MY BACK,
HELEN.

274
00:10:31,089 --> 00:10:32,132
GLENN:
HEY, HEY,
THAT IS NOT MY VOICE.

275
00:10:32,216 --> 00:10:33,425
I DON'T SOUND LIKE THAT.

279

00:13:14,753 --> 00:13:15,838
I THOUGHT
I COULD GET OVER HER

348
00:13:15,921 --> 00:13:18,257
BY GOING FOR SOMEONE ELSE.

349
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:19,591
I MEAN, WE'D BE PERFECT
TOGETHER,

350
00:13:19,675 --> 00:13:21,218
BUT HER PARENTS
DON'T APPROVE

351
00:13:21,301 --> 00:13:22,886
AND SHE WANTS TO KEEP US
A SECRET FROM THEM.

352
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:25,305
THAT HAPPENS.

353
00:13:25,389 --> 00:13:26,682
DOES IT EVER GET EASIER...
WITH GIRLS?

354
00:13:26,765 --> 00:13:28,642
NO. NOT REALLY.

355
00:13:28,725 --> 00:13:30,561
I MEAN, LOVE IS MESSY,

356
00:13:30,644 --> 00:13:33,897
AND THERE'S OBSTACLES
IN ANY RELATIONSHIP.

357
00:13:33,981 --> 00:13:35,691
THE IMPORTANT THING IS
THAT YOU GUYS LOVE EACH OTHER.

358
00:13:35,774 --> 00:13:37,693
AND IF IT TAKES HER PARENTS

359
00:13:37,776 --> 00:13:38,902
A LITTLE BIT LONGER
TO CATCH UP,

360
00:13:38,986 --> 00:13:41,405
DON'T BLAME HER FOR IT.

361
00:13:41,488 --> 00:13:42,656
IN CASE
I HAVEN'T TOLD YOU,

362
00:13:42,739 --> 00:13:44,950
YOU'RE MY IDOL.

363
00:13:45,033 --> 00:13:46,577
HEY, YOU'RE IN HIGH SCHOOL
AND THIS FAR ALONG?

364
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:48,954
YOU'RE MY IDOL.

365
00:13:49,037 --> 00:13:50,706
JUST LAY OFF THE FIGHTING,
OKAY?

366
00:13:50,789 --> 00:13:52,291
I WILL.

367
00:13:54,168 --> 00:13:55,961
I'LL TALK TO BULLFROG
ABOUT GETTING YOU GUYS BACK IN.

368
00:13:56,044 --> 00:13:57,546
GOOD LUCK.
THANKS.

369
00:14:00,174 --> 00:14:02,384
ZIG:
SO I HAVE AN IDEA.

370
00:14:02,467 --> 00:14:05,053
WHAT IF WE JUST RUSH OUT
ON THE STAGE

371
00:14:05,137 --> 00:14:06,638
AND START PLAYING
WITHOUT PERMISSION?

372
00:14:06,722 --> 00:14:07,723
AND GET THE SECURITY GUARDS
TO DRAG US OFF?

373
00:14:07,806 --> 00:14:08,932
WELL, YOU HAVE TO ADMIT,

374
00:14:09,016 --> 00:14:11,226
THAT'D BE PRETTY
ROCK AND ROLL.

375
00:14:11,310 --> 00:14:13,395
SEE? THERE SHE IS!

376
00:14:13,478 --> 00:14:16,190
I MISS SMILING MAYA.

377
00:14:16,273 --> 00:14:17,357
WELL, IT'S KINDA HARD
TO SMILE

378
00:14:17,441 --> 00:14:18,817
WHEN YOUR BOYFRIEND
WON'T TALK TO YOU.

379
00:14:18,901 --> 00:14:20,485
WHAT HAPPENED?

380
00:14:20,569 --> 00:14:23,280
WELL, I TOLD HIM
WE KISSED,

381
00:14:23,363 --> 00:14:25,741
AND NOW HE WON'T ANSWER
MY TEXTS OR MY CALLS

382
00:14:30,454 --> 00:14:33,123
I'M STILL BREAKING UP
WITH TORI TODAY,

383
00:14:35,125 --> 00:14:37,753
AND... SINCE YOU AND CAM
ARE DONE...

384
00:14:37,836 --> 00:14:39,463
ZIG, MAYBE I HAVEN'T
MADE MYSELF CLEAR.

385
00:14:39,546 --> 00:14:40,881
I DON'T WANNA BE
WITH YOU.

386
00:14:40,964 --> 00:14:41,757
I LOVE CAM.

387
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:43,091
I DON'T GET IT.

388
00:14:43,175 --> 00:14:44,927
IF YOU LOVE CAM SO MUCH,
THEN WHY DID WE KISS?!

389
00:14:45,010 --> 00:14:46,803

00:14:50,682 --> 00:14:52,434
TORI,
IT WAS A HUGE MISTAKE.

392
00:14:52,518 --> 00:14:54,186
I WAS SO CONFUSED.

393
00:14:54,269 --> 00:14:55,270

THE RIGHT THING.

I'M NOT ALLOWED TO PLAY
WITH YOU GUYS.

399

400
00:15:11,995 --> 00:15:12,829
MAYA:
CAN YOU HANDLE THAT?

401
00:15:12,913 --> 00:15:14,039
ZIG: YEAH.
MAYA: GOOD.

402
00:15:14,122 --> 00:15:15,207

TO HEAR IT.

YOU CAN'T PLAY WITH US.

00:21:15,025 --> 00:21:16,610
IT'S GOING TO BE INSANE
IN THE MEMBRANE!

WELL, OBVIOUSLY!

WEDDING PLANNER IN THE WORLD.

OF AFFECTION.

533

I HAVE NOTHING
TO BE ASHAMED OF.
