00:00:04,505 --> 00:00:06,381
GUESS WHO?!

3
00:00:06,465 --> 00:00:07,883
HAPPY FOUR MONTHS
AND ONE DAY!

4
00:00:07,966 --> 00:00:09,635
LAST NIGHT WAS PERFECT.

5
00:00:09,718 --> 00:00:12,137
I'M GLAD.
YOU DESERVED IT.

6
00:00:12,221 --> 00:00:12,888
I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE
WHAT YOU DO

7
00:00:12,971 --> 00:00:14,515
FOR OUR FIVE, SIX, SEVEN,

8
00:00:14,598 --> 00:00:17,267
EIGHT, NINE,
TEN MONTH-I-VERSARIES!

9
00:00:17,351 --> 00:00:18,477
BUT WE'LL TAKE IT
ONE AT A TIME.

10
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:20,270
(CHUCKLES)

11
00:00:20,354 --> 00:00:21,897
THE ONLY THING
THAT MATTERS

12
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:26,026
IS THAT WE GET TO SPEND
EACH ONE TOGETHER.

13
00:00:26,109 --> 00:00:29,029
SO NOW THAT OUR RELATIONSHIP
IS SO TIGHT,

14
00:00:29,112 --> 00:00:30,614
MAYBE I CAN MEET YOUR MOM?

15
00:00:32,366 --> 00:00:33,825
OH NO, YOU THINK
SHE WON'T LIKE ME?

16
00:00:33,909 --> 00:00:35,285
NO, NO,
SHE'LL LOVE YOU,

17
00:00:35,369 --> 00:00:37,371
BUT, UH,

18
00:00:37,454 --> 00:00:39,831
SHE'S JUST REALLY BUSY
WITH THE STORE AND ALL.

19
00:00:39,915 --> 00:00:41,917
MAYA:
YOU GUYS, YOU'LL NEVER GUESS
WHAT MARISOL TOLD ME!

20

MARISOL:
(CLEARS THROAT)

27
00:00:55,264 --> 00:00:56,390
YOU KNOW WHO PAYS
THE BILL

28
00:00:56,473 --> 00:00:58,517
WHEN SOMEONE DINES
AND DASHES?

29
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:01,186
UH, YOU HAVE
THE WRONG GUY.

30
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:03,272
YOU'RE IN A BAND
WITH MY BOYFRIEND

31
00:01:03,355 --> 00:01:04,857
AND YOUR GIRLFRIEND
IS ON POWER SQUAD...

32
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:06,900
WITH ME.

33
00:01:06,984 --> 00:01:09,027
OKAY, PLEASE,
PLEASE DON'T TELL TORI, OKAY?

34
00:01:09,111 --> 00:01:10,904
LOOK, I CAN PAY YOU BACK,
I SWEAR.

35
00:01:10,988 --> 00:01:12,739
FIFTY BUCKS.

36
00:01:12,823 --> 00:01:14,408
THE BILL WAS THIRTY-FIVE!

37
00:01:14,491 --> 00:01:16,618
I THINK I DESERVE
A GENEROUS TIP.

38
00:01:18,996 --> 00:01:21,456
LOOK, I DON'T HAVE
THAT ON ME, OKAY?

39
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:23,458
YOU HAVE TWENTY-FOUR HOURS
OR I TELL TORI

40
00:01:25,127 --> 00:01:27,379
AND THEN SEND MO
TO COLLECT,

41
00:01:27,462 --> 00:01:29,381

DALLAS:
STEADY.

60
00:02:28,398 --> 00:02:30,275
BUT A PRETTY FACE MIGHT
BOOST TICKET SALES.

61
00:02:30,359 --> 00:02:31,401
YEAH, WELL,
I HAVE A GYM TO SET UP,

62
00:02:31,485 --> 00:02:32,653
A BANNER TO HANG-

63
00:02:32,736 --> 00:02:34,071
MY GUYS ARE ALREADY
ON IT.

64

FOR SOME REASON,
BO AND INGVAR

65
00:02:35,447 --> 00:02:37,950
JUST LOVE TO DECORATE.

66
00:02:38,033 --> 00:02:40,410
YOU SHOULD, UH,
COME TAKE A BREAK.

67
00:02:43,956 --> 00:02:45,249
YOU'RE GOING ABOVE AND BEYOND
HERE, DALLAS.

68
00:02:45,332 --> 00:02:46,583
YEAH, THAT'S HOW I ROLL.

69
00:02:46,667 --> 00:02:48,919
I ALWAYS GIVE 150 PERCENT.

70
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:50,963
THERE'S NO SUCH THING
AS 150 PERCENT.

71
00:02:51,046 --> 00:02:52,548
I SHOULD KNOW BETTER

72
00:02:52,631 --> 00:02:55,050
THAN TO USE TRITE SPORTS CLICHES
AROUND YOU.

73
00:02:55,133 --> 00:02:57,177
EITHER YOU STAYED UP LATE
READING THE DICTIONARY

74
00:02:57,261 --> 00:02:58,679
OR YOU HAVE A BETTER VOCABULARY
THAN THE AVERAGE JOCK.

75
00:02:58,762 --> 00:03:00,722
CAREFUL,

76
00:03:00,806 --> 00:03:02,432
YOU'RE VERY CLOSE TO ADMITTING
YOU WERE WRONG ABOUT ME.

77
00:03:02,516 --> 00:03:03,600
(CHUCKLES)

78
00:03:03,684 --> 00:03:05,435

UM...

79
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:06,687
OH, HEY, IMMY,
WHAT'S UP?

80
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:09,398
IT CAN WAIT.

81
00:03:09,481 --> 00:03:12,401
DALLAS:
I'LL GO, UH, CHECK ON BO
AND INGVAR.

82
00:03:12,484 --> 00:03:15,112
WHAT IS IT?

83
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:16,780
IMOGEN:
I JUST THOUGHT MAYBE
WE COULD TALK,

84
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:19,116
BUT OBVIOUSLY YOU'RE TOO BUSY
FLIRTING WITH A GUY FOR THAT.

85
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:21,326
WE WERE JOKING AROUND.

86
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:22,369
IT'S HARD WORK
PLANNING A DANCE,

87
00:03:22,452 --> 00:03:24,121
YOU KNOW,
SO YOUR BAND CAN PLAY.

88
00:03:25,122 --> 00:03:26,665
WHEN MO TOLD ME
ABOUT THIS DANCE,

89
00:03:26,748 --> 00:03:27,958
I KNEW IT.

90
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:29,209
YOU ORGANIZED IT FOR ME,

91
00:03:29,293 --> 00:03:30,252
BUT YOU SAID
MY BAND WAS SILLY.

92
00:03:30,335 --> 00:03:32,212
AND THIS IS MY APOLOGY.

93
00:03:32,296 --> 00:03:34,173
SO IS THAT THE PLAN,
FIONA?

94
00:03:34,256 --> 00:03:35,048
YOU'RE GONNA THROW
AN EVENT FOR ME

95
00:03:35,132 --> 00:03:36,592
EVERY TIME YOU CAN'T
TALK TO ME?

96
00:03:36,675 --> 00:03:37,301
WE CAN TALK
WHENEVER YOU WANT.

97
00:03:37,384 --> 00:03:40,053
NO, WE CAN'T!

98
00:03:40,137 --> 00:03:42,055
YOU CAME BACK FROM NEW YORK
AND DECIDED EVERYTHING.

99
00:03:42,139 --> 00:03:43,348
WE NEED TO SPEND
EVERY MINUTE TOGETHER,

100
00:03:43,432 --> 00:03:44,892
I'M A LESBIAN,
I'M YOUR GIRLFRIEND,

101
00:03:44,975 --> 00:03:46,935
LET'S BROADCAST IT
TO THE WORLD!

102
00:03:47,019 --> 00:03:49,146
YOU'RE HAVING
SECOND THOUGHTS.

103
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:50,314
I CARE ABOUT YOU
MORE THAN ANYONE-

104
00:03:50,397 --> 00:03:51,106
WELL, IT DOESN'T
SOUND LIKE IT!

105
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:52,149
BUT YOU'RE PRESSURING ME!

106
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:55,152
FINE!
PRESSURE'S OFF.

107
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:56,737
LET ME KNOW
WHAT YOU DECIDE.

108
00:04:10,334 --> 00:04:12,961
SOMETHING YOU NEED
TO TELL ME?

109
00:04:13,045 --> 00:04:15,422
UH...
BECKY GAVE IT TO ME

110
00:04:15,506 --> 00:04:18,342
IN CASE BEING IN THE MUSICAL
TURNS ME GAY.

111
00:04:18,425 --> 00:04:19,551
I DON'T THINK THAT'S
HOW THAT WORKS.

112
00:04:19,635 --> 00:04:20,677
(CHUCKLES)

113
00:04:20,761 --> 00:04:22,429
THAT GIRL'S WACK.

114
00:04:22,513 --> 00:04:23,847
SHE HAS A POINT THOUGH.

115
00:04:23,931 --> 00:04:25,807
EVERYONE'S GONNA SEE ME
IN THE MUSICAL,

116
00:04:25,891 --> 00:04:27,851
AND TODAY WE'RE TAKING
PHOTOS FOR POSTERS

117
00:04:27,935 --> 00:04:29,895
THAT ARE GONNA BE PLASTERED
ALL OVER THE SCHOOL.

118
00:04:32,356 --> 00:04:33,482
WHAT ARE PEOPLE
GONNA THINK?

119
00:04:33,565 --> 00:04:34,816
WHO CARES?

120
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:36,777
THE PEOPLE THAT LOVE YOU
KNOW WHO YOU ARE.

121
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:38,946
YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT.

122
00:04:39,029 --> 00:04:40,155
I MEAN, THE WHOLE REASON
WHY I'M DOING THIS MUSICAL

123
00:04:40,239 --> 00:04:42,282
IS BECAUSE OF PEOPLE
LIKE BECKY BAKER.

124
00:04:42,366 --> 00:04:44,493
AND BECAUSE YOU LOOK
SO GOOD IN TIGHTS.

125

CONTROL PILLS.

SO I GUESS YOU'RE TAKING THEM
FOR YOUR...?

MY PARENTS ARE GOING OUT
TO A DINNER PARTY TONIGHT.

131
00:05:02,678 --> 00:05:04,555
I THOUGHT MAYBE WE COULD SKIP
OUT OF THE DANCE EARLY

132
00:05:04,638 --> 00:05:07,975
AND...
ONLY IF YOU WANT TO.

133
00:05:08,058 --> 00:05:10,936
UH...
I FEEL SO PRESSURED.

I DON'T KNOW.

136
00:05:14,565 --> 00:05:15,941
SEEING YOUR CONFIDENCE
ON STAGE YESTERDAY

137
00:05:16,024 --> 00:05:18,277
REALLY CONVINCED ME
THAT IT WAS...TIME.

IT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE
THERE'S ANYONE HERE.

162
00:06:05,866 --> 00:06:08,368

CAN WE TALK
BEFORE YOU GO ON STAGE?

355
00:14:06,138 --> 00:14:07,598
OR YOU COULD TALK

356
00:14:07,681 --> 00:14:09,892

361
00:14:23,614 --> 00:14:25,490
AND I'M WORRIED

362
00:14:25,574 --> 00:14:28,493
THAT'S NOT GONNA BE
GOOD ENOUGH FOR YOU.

363
00:14:28,577 --> 00:14:30,078

EVERYTHING THAT'S GOING ON
WITH MY FAMILY RIGHT NOW

366
00:14:34,791 --> 00:14:37,294
IS SO UP-IN-THE-AIR...

367
00:14:37,377 --> 00:14:39,254
AND I WAS LOOKING
FOR SOLID GROUND WITH YOU.

368
00:14:39,338 --> 00:14:41,882
BUT I PUSHED TOO HARD.

369
00:14:41,965 --> 00:14:43,050
SO WHATEVER SPEED
YOU'RE ON,

370
00:14:43,133 --> 00:14:45,260
I CAN BE ON

371
00:14:45,344 --> 00:14:48,388
