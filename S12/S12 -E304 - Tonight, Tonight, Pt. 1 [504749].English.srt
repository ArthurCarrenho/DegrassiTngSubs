358
00:14:20,611 --> 00:14:22,487
I NEEDED TO BE ALONE
WITH YOU.

359
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:27,451
HOW THICK IS YOUR SKULL?

360
00:14:27,534 --> 00:14:28,994
NOTHING CAN HAPPEN
BETWEEN US.

361
00:14:29,077 --> 00:14:31,872

YOU TOLD ME TO BE NICE
TO TORI,

368
00:14:48,013 --> 00:14:48,514
AND IT'S NOT NICE
TO BE WITH HER

369
00:14:48,597 --> 00:14:49,806
WHEN I LIKE YOU.

370
00:14:49,890 --> 00:14:52,559
