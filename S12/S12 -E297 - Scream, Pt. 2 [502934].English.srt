1
00:00:01,668 --> 00:00:03,921
CLARE:
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU WANT ME TO SAY.

2
00:00:04,004 --> 00:00:05,047
MS. OH:
THE ALLEGATIONS ELI HAS MADE
ON YOUR BEHALF

3
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:07,174
ARE VERY SERIOUS.

4
00:00:07,257 --> 00:00:07,925
HELEN:
ARE YOU OKAY, HONEY?

5
00:00:08,008 --> 00:00:09,676
CLARE:
I'M FINE.

6
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:12,179
'KAY, WHATEVER ELI SAID,
HE'S MISTAKEN.

7
00:00:12,262 --> 00:00:13,889
CAN THIS BE OVER?

8
00:00:13,972 --> 00:00:15,849
CLARE, I CALLED
THE INTERPRETER.

9
00:00:15,933 --> 00:00:18,477
THEY CONFIRMED YOU HAVEN'T
WORKED THERE IN WEEKS,

10
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:21,980
BUT THE FORMS YOU HANDED IN
SAY OTHERWISE.

11
00:00:22,064 --> 00:00:23,899
I FORGED THEM, OKAY?

12
00:00:23,982 --> 00:00:25,192
MY CO-OP DIDN'T WORK OUT,

13
00:00:25,275 --> 00:00:26,568
AND I DIDN'T WANT ANYONE
TO KNOW.

14
00:00:26,652 --> 00:00:27,528
CLARE!

15
00:00:27,611 --> 00:00:29,571
MOM!

16
00:00:29,655 --> 00:00:30,656
MS. OH:
THEY SAID THEY DISMISSED YOU

17
00:00:30,739 --> 00:00:32,366
WHEN YOU BECAME OBSESSED
WITH YOUR MENTOR.

18
00:00:32,449 --> 00:00:34,117
BUT THAT'S NOT TRUE,
IS IT?

19
00:00:34,201 --> 00:00:35,702
SURE IS.

20
00:00:36,828 --> 00:00:38,747
SCHOOL GIRL CRUSH,
I GUESS.

21
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:41,250
CASE CLOSED.
CAN I GO?

22
00:00:41,333 --> 00:00:44,211
ELI SAID
IT WENT THE OTHER WAY.

23
00:00:44,294 --> 00:00:47,256
HE SAID YOUR MENTOR
KISSED YOU.

24
00:00:47,339 --> 00:00:48,423
HOW COULD YOU KEEP THIS
A SECRET?!

25
00:00:48,507 --> 00:00:50,008
I DIDN'T!

26
00:00:54,555 --> 00:00:56,765
I WENT TO ASHER'S BOSS,
BUT HE'D ALREADY BLAMED ME...

27
00:00:56,849 --> 00:00:58,350
AND SHE BELIEVED HIM.

28
00:01:00,269 --> 00:01:01,228
OH MY GOSH.

29
00:01:01,311 --> 00:01:02,813
MOM, IT'S FINE.

30
00:01:03,897 --> 00:01:05,858
IT'S OVER.

31
00:01:05,941 --> 00:01:06,650
MS. OH:
IF HE REALLY ASSAULTED YOU,

32
00:01:06,733 --> 00:01:07,609
WE HAVE TO GO
TO THE POLICE.

33
00:01:07,693 --> 00:01:10,487
WITH WHAT PROOF?

34
00:01:10,571 --> 00:01:12,906
HE HAS EVIDENCE AGAINST ME -
TEXTS, TWEETS, PHONE CALLS.

35
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:14,366
IT'S MY WORD AGAINST HIS.

36
00:01:14,449 --> 00:01:16,952
HE WILL WIN.
I CAN'T GO THROUGH THAT AGAIN!

37
00:01:17,035 --> 00:01:18,328
WE CAN'T LET HIM
GET AWAY WITH THIS.

38
00:01:18,412 --> 00:01:19,997
WHEN CAN WE TALK
TO THEM?

39
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,957
DON'T I GET A SAY

58

TORI:
(DROWNED OUT BY JAM SESSION)
HAVE YOU GUYS SEEN...

59
00:02:16,178 --> 00:02:18,931
HAVE YOU GUYS SEEN...
HEY! HEY!

60
00:02:19,014 --> 00:02:19,890
HAVE YOU GUYS SEEN
TRISTAN?

61
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:21,725
UH, NO. WHY?

62
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:22,976
NO ONE KNOWS
WHERE HE IS!

63
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:24,728
WOW! WAY TO GO, TRIS!

64
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:26,480
WAY TO GO?!

65
00:02:26,563 --> 00:02:27,648
ARE WE HAVING THE SAME
CONVERSATION HERE?

66
00:02:27,731 --> 00:02:29,942
WELL,
DIDN'T HE TELL YOU?

67
00:02:30,025 --> 00:02:31,944
I THINK HE WENT TO MEET
THAT GUY.

68
00:02:32,027 --> 00:02:34,530
WHAT GUY?
HIS SECRET ADMIRER.

69
00:02:34,613 --> 00:02:37,658
HE GOT A NOTE AND A FLOWER
AND EVERYTHING.

70
00:02:37,741 --> 00:02:39,326
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!

71
00:02:39,409 --> 00:02:41,036
HERE I AM,
FREAKING OUT,

72
00:02:41,119 --> 00:02:42,454
AND HE'S OFF RISKING
THE PLAY'S OPENING NIGHT

73
00:02:42,538 --> 00:02:46,124
TO MACK ON SOME GUY
HE BARELY KNOWS?

74
00:02:46,208 --> 00:02:48,001
UGH! COME ON.
WE GOTTA FIND HIM.

75
00:02:48,085 --> 00:02:49,294
ZIG:
WELL, HOLD ON A SECOND.

76
00:02:49,378 --> 00:02:52,047
MAYBE HE'S GETTING
HIS FIRST KISS.

77
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:53,799
WE SHOULD PROBABLY GIVE HIM
SOME SPACE.

78
00:02:55,551 --> 00:02:56,760
THERE'S NO TIME
FOR SPACE!

79
00:02:56,844 --> 00:02:58,345
COME ON!

80
00:03:00,264 --> 00:03:01,765
COME ON!

81
00:03:06,812 --> 00:03:09,106
ADAM:
I THOUGHT YOU'D SKIP THIS
TO START PICKETING THE PLAY.

82
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:11,275
I'M NOT GOING
TO PROTEST.

83
00:03:11,358 --> 00:03:12,401
I'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT
WHAT YOU SAID-

84
00:03:12,484 --> 00:03:13,986
SORRY. ONE SEC.

85
00:03:14,069 --> 00:03:16,446
UM, HAS ANYONE SEEN
TRISTAN TODAY?

86
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:18,031
UH, THE LEAD IN THE PLAY?

87
00:03:19,908 --> 00:03:21,660
(SIGHS)
WORTH A SHOT.

88
00:03:21,743 --> 00:03:23,453
SORRY,
WHAT WERE YOU SAYING?

89
00:03:23,537 --> 00:03:26,957
UH, JUST THAT
I WANTED YOU TO KNOW

90
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,625
I WOULD NEVER INTENTIONALLY
HURT ANYONE AND-

91
00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:31,253
HE PROBABLY CAME
TO HIS SENSES!

92
00:03:31,336 --> 00:03:33,088
EXCUSE ME?

93
00:03:33,172 --> 00:03:34,298
REALIZED HOW WRONG THE PLAY WAS
AND BAILED.

94
00:03:34,381 --> 00:03:37,092
I MEAN,
GOOD ON HIM.

95
00:03:37,176 --> 00:03:38,218
WHY DO I HAVE THE FEELING
THAT YOU PEOPLE

96
00:03:38,302 --> 00:03:40,345
HAVE SOMETHING TO DO
WITH TRISTAN GOING AWOL?

97
00:03:40,429 --> 00:03:41,638
HE PROBABLY JUST GOT
STAGE FRIGHT.

98
00:03:41,722 --> 00:03:43,348
WELL, CAN YOU BLAME HIM?

99
00:03:43,432 --> 00:03:44,808
I MEAN,
WITH ALL THE HOMOPHOBIA

100
00:03:44,892 --> 00:03:46,768
YOU GUYS HAVE BEEN SPEWING
SINCE YOU GOT HERE,

101
00:03:46,852 --> 00:03:48,812
I'D BE AFRAID TO GET UP
THERE, TOO!

102
00:03:51,023 --> 00:03:52,691
I FORGOT OUR FOSSIL.
I'LL BE BACK.

103
00:03:55,944 --> 00:03:57,070
SWEAR TO ME
YOU HAD NOTHING TO DO

104
00:03:57,154 --> 00:03:58,363
WITH TRISTAN GOING MISSING.
WHAT?

105
00:03:58,447 --> 00:04:00,908
SWEAR TO GOD!

106
00:04:00,991 --> 00:04:02,701
WHAT IS THE BIG DEAL?

107
00:04:02,784 --> 00:04:04,494
THEY'LL HAVE TO CANCEL
THE PLAY!

108
00:04:04,578 --> 00:04:07,372
ISN'T THAT WHAT YOU WANTED
ALL ALONG?

109
00:04:07,456 --> 00:04:08,957
(GUILTY, HAUGHTY HUFF)

110
00:04:10,292 --> 00:04:11,877
(DOOR OPENS)

111
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,670
SECRETARY:
HERE YOU GO.

112
00:04:13,754 --> 00:04:14,254
HELEN:
WE'LL TALK MORE ABOUT THIS
AFTER SCHOOL.

113
00:04:14,338 --> 00:04:15,839
AWESOME.

114
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:18,550
ELI:
HEY. HOW WAS IT?

115
00:04:18,634 --> 00:04:20,219
GO TO HELL!
YOU NEEDED HELP.

116
00:04:20,302 --> 00:04:23,096
I NEEDED MS. OH
TO CALL ME OUT FOR LYING?

117
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:23,680
IT COULDN'T BE
A SECRET ANYMORE.

118
00:04:23,764 --> 00:04:26,099
IT WON'T BE!

119
00:04:26,183 --> 00:04:27,935
THEY WANT ME TO GO
TO THE POLICE,

120
00:04:28,018 --> 00:04:30,812
WITH NO EVIDENCE,
TO GET HUMILIATED AGAIN.

121
00:04:33,899 --> 00:04:36,360
THE ONLY WAY
I WON'T LOOK FOOLISH

122
00:04:36,443 --> 00:04:39,196
WHEN I'M QUESTIONED

123
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:43,158
IS IF I PLANT SOMETHING
ON ASHER, TONIGHT.

124
00:04:43,242 --> 00:04:45,118
SO I AM ASKING
ONE LAST TIME...

125
00:04:48,372 --> 00:04:49,873
ARE YOU IN?

126
00:04:53,377 --> 00:04:54,920
I'M SORRY.
I DON'T THINK IT'S RIGHT.

127
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:01,176
THEN GO WORK
ON YOUR STUPID PLAY.

128
00:05:03,637 --> 00:05:05,138
I SAID GO!

129
00:05:13,772 --> 00:05:16,108
KATIE:
CLARE? HEY. ARE YOU OKAY?

130
00:05:16,191 --> 00:05:17,693
NOT REMOTELY, NO.

131
00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:21,071
IS THERE ANYTHING
I CAN DO?

132
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:26,243
THAT SON OF A BITCH!

133
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:27,119
OKAY, HOW CAN I HELP?

134
00:05:27,202 --> 00:05:28,537
I HAVE AN IDEA,

135
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:30,289
BUT YOU CAN'T TELL JAKE.
EVER.

136
00:05:30,372 --> 00:05:33,125
OKAY, I WON'T.
I PROMISE.

137
00:05:33,208 --> 00:05:33,959
THE INTERPRETER STAFF
WILL BE AT THE TORONTO

138
00:05:34,042 --> 00:05:36,128
JOURNALISM AWARDS TONIGHT -

139
00:05:36,211 --> 00:05:37,880
AN EVENT I SHOULD RIGHTFULLY
BE ATTENDING -

140
00:05:37,963 --> 00:05:39,214
BUT THE OFFICE
WILL BE EMPTY.

141
00:05:39,298 --> 00:05:41,550
SO WE SNEAK IN AND...

142
00:05:41,633 --> 00:05:42,509
AND PLANT SOME FILES
ON HIS COMPUTER.

143
00:05:42,593 --> 00:05:44,386
SERIOUSLY?!

144
00:05:44,469 --> 00:05:45,679
I JUST NEED YOU
TO GET US PAST SECURITY,

145
00:05:45,762 --> 00:05:46,847
AND THEN PLAY LOOK-OUT.
OKAY.

146
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:48,599
AND THE FILES?

147
00:05:48,682 --> 00:05:50,350
I DOWNLOADED SOME SOFTWARE

148
00:05:50,434 --> 00:05:51,935
THAT SPOOFS THE "MODIFIED ON"
AND "CREATED ON" DATES,

149
00:05:52,019 --> 00:05:54,396
SO IT'LL SEEM LIKE THE FILES
WERE CREATED WEEKS AGO.

150
00:05:59,109 --> 00:06:01,778
I'M GONNA TAKE SOME PHOTOS...
OF ME -

151
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:04,698
SEXY ONES.

152
00:06:04,781 --> 00:06:06,950
UH, WON'T THAT
MAKE YOU LOOK

153
00:06:07,034 --> 00:06:08,869
A LITTLE MORE OBSESSED
WITH HIM?

154
00:06:08,952 --> 00:06:11,705
IT DOESN'T MATTER.
I'M SEVENTEEN.

155
00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:12,998
HE SHOULDN'T HAVE PHOTOS OF ME
ON HIS COMPUTER,

156
00:06:13,081 --> 00:06:14,625
AND ACCORDING TO THE LAW,

157
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:15,959
A LITTLE BIT OF NUDITY
MEANS CHILD PORNOGRAPHY.

158
00:06:16,043 --> 00:06:17,711
CUT AND DRY.
HE GOES TO JAIL.

159
00:06:17,794 --> 00:06:20,714
NUDITY?!
YOU'D REALLY DO THAT?

160
00:06:20,797 --> 00:06:23,091
I'VE TRIED EVERYTHING.

161
00:06:23,175 --> 00:06:24,343
I'VE CALLED EVERY GIRL
HE'S EVER WORKED WITH

162
00:06:24,426 --> 00:06:27,679
AND NO ONE WILL ADMIT
HE DID ANYTHING BAD.

163
00:06:27,763 --> 00:06:28,680
I HAVE NO ONE
TO CORROBORATE MY STORY.

164
00:06:28,764 --> 00:06:30,307
THIS IS THE ONLY WAY.

165
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:32,351
BY MANUFACTURING EVIDENCE?

166
00:06:32,434 --> 00:06:34,019
CLARE,
WHAT ABOUT THE TRUTH?

167
00:06:34,102 --> 00:06:37,898
THE TRUTH IS THAT
ASHER IS GUILTY...

168
00:06:37,981 --> 00:06:40,776
AND I JUST NEED SOME HELP
CONVINCING PEOPLE.

169
00:06:44,279 --> 00:06:46,490
IF YOU'RE WILLING
TO TAKE THOSE PICTURES...

170
00:06:46,573 --> 00:06:48,075
I'M IN.

171
00:06:52,162 --> 00:06:53,539
TORI:
TRISTAN'S GONNA BE CONVINCING
IN THAT DEATH SCENE,

172
00:06:53,622 --> 00:06:55,207
BECAUSE WHEN I FIND HIM,
I'M GONNA KILL HIM.

173
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:57,167
ZIG:
I'LL TRY HIS CELL AGAIN.

174
00:06:57,251 --> 00:06:58,836
MAYA:
GO EASY ON HIM TOR.
HE'S NEVER BEEN IN LOVE BEFORE.

175
00:06:58,919 --> 00:06:59,628
TORI:
HE'S ALSO NEVER BEEN THE LEAD
