00:06:46,865 --> 00:06:48,367
SHE MET AT THE CASINO.

180
00:06:50,452 --> 00:06:52,621
HMM.
MAYBE THAT'S IT.

181
00:06:52,704 --> 00:06:54,373
MR. TOWNSEND:
GOOD AFTERNOON,
TRIVIA BUFFS!

182
00:06:54,456 --> 00:06:56,208
TODAY, LET'S BRUSH UP
ON GEOGRAPHY.

183
00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:00,045
MR. TOWNSEND COMES
INTO LITTLE MISS STEAKS

184
00:07:00,128 --> 00:07:02,756
EVERY WEDNESDAY
FOR DARTS.

185
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:05,551
YOU THINK HE'S SINGLE?

186
00:07:05,634 --> 00:07:08,303
WHAT IS THE CAPITOL CITY
OF ROMANIA?

187
00:07:08,387 --> 00:07:11,223
BIANCA:
SIR, ARE YOU SINGLE?

188
00:07:11,306 --> 00:07:12,850
MR. TOWNSEND:
THE CAPITOL, MS. DESOUSA?

189
00:07:12,933 --> 00:07:14,351
BIANCA:
BUCHAREST.

190
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:15,853
IS THAT SOMEWHERE YOU'D LIKE
TO TAKE YOUR GIRLFRIEND?

191
00:07:15,936 --> 00:07:17,813
IF I HAD A GIRLFRIEND,

192
00:07:17,896 --> 00:07:19,273
I'D TAKE HER SOMEWHERE ROMANTIC,
LIKE HAWAII.

193
00:07:19,356 --> 00:07:21,733
NEXT QUESTION.

194
00:07:21,817 --> 00:07:23,318
WHAT COUNTRY HAS
THE LONGEST COASTLINE?

195
00:07:26,363 --> 00:07:28,115
LOVE COMES IN MANY FORMS

196
00:07:28,198 --> 00:07:28,824
AND IT'S ABOUT TIME
WE SEE THAT REFLECTED

197
00:07:28,907 --> 00:07:30,826
IN THE STORIES WE TELL.

198
00:07:30,909 --> 00:07:31,910
WHY DO READERS CARE?

199
00:07:31,994 --> 00:07:33,954
WHY IS IT NEWSWORTHY?

200
00:07:34,037 --> 00:07:35,747
WELL, THE NEWS IS FILLED
WITH STORIES ABOUT TEENS:

201
00:07:35,831 --> 00:07:38,125
BULLYING, HATE CRIMES.

202
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:39,209
BUT THERE ARE TEENS

203
00:07:39,293 --> 00:07:41,753
WHO ARE ALSO TRYING
TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE.

204
00:07:41,837 --> 00:07:42,963
I THINK MY GENERATION'S
GONNA CHANGE THE WORLD,

205
00:07:43,046 --> 00:07:44,089
AND MAYBE THAT'S NAIVE,
BUT-

206
00:07:44,173 --> 00:07:47,050
THAT'S NOT NAIVE,
CLARE;

207
00:07:47,134 --> 00:07:48,635
THAT'S YOUR POINT OF VIEW.

208
00:07:51,388 --> 00:07:54,057
WOW. I CAME HERE CONVINCED
I WAS GETTING FIRED

209
00:07:54,141 --> 00:07:56,435
AND NOW I'M EATING
ETHIOPIAN FOOD

210
00:07:56,518 --> 00:07:58,937
WITH WAR CORRESPONDENT
ASHER SHOSTAK.

211
00:07:59,021 --> 00:08:01,523
WE HAVEN'T EVEN GOT
TO THE BEST PART YET.

212
00:08:01,607 --> 00:08:03,108
DESSERT?

213
00:08:04,359 --> 00:08:06,653
WE'RE GONNA WRITE
YOUR ARTICLE.

214
00:08:06,737 --> 00:08:08,238
(LAUGH OF DISBELIEF)

215
00:08:14,828 --> 00:08:16,330
OUR LITTLE SECRET.

216
00:08:17,372 --> 00:08:18,874
CHEERS.

217
00:08:30,677 --> 00:08:32,304
MAYA:
HOW'S MY GORGEOUS BIG SISTER?

218
00:08:32,387 --> 00:08:33,764
WOW, YOU ARE GOOD
WITH THOSE SHEARS.

219
00:08:33,847 --> 00:08:35,724
IS THERE ANYTHING
YOU AREN'T GOOD AT?

220
00:08:35,807 --> 00:08:37,267
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

221
00:08:37,351 --> 00:08:38,018
UM, COULD YOU DRIVE ME
TO THE MALL LATER?

222
00:08:38,101 --> 00:08:39,603
IT'S IMPORTANT.

223
00:08:41,021 --> 00:08:44,024
WAIT.
DO YOU HAVE A DATE?

224
00:08:44,107 --> 00:08:45,651
WITH WHO?
IS IT THAT ZIG GUY?

225
00:08:45,734 --> 00:08:47,110
NEVERMIND!
I CAN TAKE THE BUS.

226
00:08:47,194 --> 00:08:48,695
OH, COME ON...
WHO IS IT?

227
00:08:52,449 --> 00:08:54,576
I PROMISE I WON'T TELL
MOM AND DAD.

228
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:56,954
CAMPBELL SAUNDERS.

229
00:08:57,037 --> 00:08:59,957
MAYA, NO.
NO WAY.

230
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,291
HOCKEY GUYS ARE BAD NEWS.

231
00:09:01,375 --> 00:09:02,918
(SHEARS SNIP)

232
00:09:03,001 --> 00:09:04,461
THAT IS, LIKE,
SO TYPICAL OF YOU,

233
00:09:04,545 --> 00:09:05,254
TO MAKE AN ASSUMPTION
ABOUT SOMEONE

234
00:09:05,337 --> 00:09:06,755
THAT YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW.

235
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:07,965
TRUST ME,
THIS IS FOR YOUR OWN GOOD.

236
00:09:08,048 --> 00:09:10,467
YOU'LL THANK ME LATER.

237
00:09:10,551 --> 00:09:11,718
YOU KNOW,
JUST BECAUSE DREW DUMPED YOU,

238
00:09:11,802 --> 00:09:14,888
IT DOESN'T MEAN
EVERY JOCK'S A JERK.

239
00:09:14,972 --> 00:09:16,515
(SIGHS) HE'S SWEET,
I SWEAR.

240
00:09:16,598 --> 00:09:18,141
IF YOU MET HIM,
YOU'D SEE.

241
00:09:20,561 --> 00:09:22,855
OKAY, FINE.

242
00:09:22,938 --> 00:09:24,439
I'LL DRIVE.

243
00:09:25,816 --> 00:09:28,735
BUT?
I'M CHAPERONING.

244
00:09:28,819 --> 00:09:30,320
(SIGHS, HORRIFIED)

245
00:09:35,492 --> 00:09:36,702
CLARE:
OKAY. WE HAVE TO ACT
PROFESSIONAL

246
00:09:36,785 --> 00:09:37,703
DURING THE INTERVIEW.

247
00:09:37,786 --> 00:09:39,204
NO TOUCHING.

248
00:09:39,288 --> 00:09:40,831
NOT LIKE YOU'RE
MY BOYFRIEND.

249
00:09:40,914 --> 00:09:43,041
ELI:
SO YOU GO FOR A LUNCH DATE
WITH YOUR BOSS

250
00:09:43,125 --> 00:09:43,750
AND NOW I'M NOT ALLOWED
TO TOUCH YOU?

251
00:09:43,834 --> 00:09:44,918
SHOULD I BE JEALOUS?

252
00:09:45,002 --> 00:09:47,254
WHAT? NO!
OF COURSE NOT.

253
00:09:47,337 --> 00:09:49,047
GOOD. BECAUSE IF ANYONE
GOT BETWEEN US

254
00:09:49,131 --> 00:09:50,299
I'D HAVE TO KILL THEM.

255
00:09:50,382 --> 00:09:52,551
EASY, DEXTER.

256
00:09:52,634 --> 00:09:55,846
I'VE ONLY GOT EYES FOR YOU
AND YOU KNOW IT.

257
00:09:55,929 --> 00:09:58,056
ASHER:
HOPE I'M NOT INTERRUPTING.

258
00:09:58,140 --> 00:09:59,558
CLARE:
ASHER!

259
00:09:59,641 --> 00:10:02,144
THIS IS ELI GOLDSWORTHY,
THE DIRECTOR.

260
00:10:02,227 --> 00:10:02,853
THANKS FOR AGREEING

261
00:10:02,936 --> 00:10:03,854

262
00:10:03,937 --> 00:10:05,814
YEAH, NO PROBLEM.

263
00:10:05,898 --> 00:10:08,984
CAN YOU DO ME A HUGE ONE
AND RUN OUT FOR A COFFEE?

264
00:10:09,735 --> 00:10:11,862

265
00:10:16,116 --> 00:10:17,618

I'M SORRY
IT TOOK SO LONG;

274

00:11:10,587 --> 00:11:14,925
OH, AND LOOK FOR THE ARTICLE
IN TOMORROW'S PAPER.

279
00:11:15,008 --> 00:11:15,717
LOOK, YOU DIDN'T MISS
ANYTHING.

280
00:11:15,801 --> 00:11:17,636
HIS QUESTIONS WERE TERRIBLE.

281
00:11:17,719 --> 00:11:19,972
I DON'T EVEN WANT HIM
TO WRITE THE ARTICLE.

282
00:11:20,055 --> 00:11:21,390
HEY. THANKS TO YOUR
BRILLIANT PITCH,

283
00:11:21,473 --> 00:11:22,349
THIS ARTICLE IS GOING
TO LOOK GREAT

284
00:11:22,432 --> 00:11:24,560
IN MY NYU PORTFOLIO.

285
00:11:24,643 --> 00:11:26,311
I GUESS THAT'S TRUE.

286
00:11:26,395 --> 00:11:28,689
AND I TOTALLY GET WHY
YOU'RE OBSESSED WITH HIM.

287
00:11:28,772 --> 00:11:30,440
ASHER HAD SOME INSIGHTFUL
QUESTIONS.

288
00:11:30,524 --> 00:11:31,859
I THINK I MIGHT
MARRY HIM, TOO.

289
00:11:31,942 --> 00:11:34,278
BUT I HAD
INSIGHTFUL QUESTIONS.

290
00:11:34,361 --> 00:11:37,364
DID YOU TELL HIM
ABOUT BECKY BAKER?
NO.

291
00:11:37,447 --> 00:11:38,740
WELL, WHAT ABOUT
HOW YOU TAUGHT DAVE TO ACT

292
00:11:38,824 --> 00:11:40,242
LIKE HE WAS IN LOVE
WITH A GUY?

293
00:11:40,325 --> 00:11:41,952
NO.

294
00:11:42,035 --> 00:11:45,038
ASHER NEEDS TO KNOW
ALL THOSE FACTS.

295
00:11:45,122 --> 00:11:47,624
THE ARTICLE IS GONNA BE
INCOMPLETE WITHOUT THEM.

296
00:11:47,708 --> 00:11:49,084
I HAVE TO GO TELL HIM.

297
00:11:49,168 --> 00:11:50,002
FOR THE SAKE
OF THE ARTICLE?

298
00:11:50,085 --> 00:11:51,753
FOR THE SAKE OF JOURNALISM!

299
00:11:55,090 --> 00:11:56,592
CLARE:
ASHER! WAIT.

300
00:11:59,178 --> 00:11:59,970
I'M NOT GONNA BECOME
A BETTER JOURNALIST

301
00:12:00,053 --> 00:12:01,555
BY FETCHING COFFEE.

302
00:12:03,307 --> 00:12:03,724
WHAT ARE YOU TRYING
TO SAY, CLARE?

303
00:12:03,807 --> 00:12:05,142
BE ON POINT.

304
00:12:05,225 --> 00:12:08,270
I WANT TO WRITE
THE ARTICLE.

305
00:12:08,353 --> 00:12:09,563
I'M NOT SURE
YOU'RE READY.

306
00:12:09,646 --> 00:12:11,064
I'M THE EDITOR

I LIKE YOUR MOXIE,

311
00:12:21,408 --> 00:12:23,535
OKAY. SURE.

312
00:12:23,619 --> 00:12:25,120
HERE ARE MY NOTES.

313
00:12:26,455 --> 00:12:27,956

00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:31,460
UNLESS YOU CAN'T
HANDLE IT.

316
00:12:31,543 --> 00:12:33,921
NO! I... I CAN.

317
00:12:34,004 --> 00:12:36,256
YOU WON'T REGRET THIS,
I PROMISE.

318
00:12:38,217 --> 00:12:39,718
(DOOR SLAMS,
CAR STARTS UP)

319
00:12:45,516 --> 00:12:46,808
MAYA:
SO WHAT DID YOU THINK
OF THE MOVIE?

320
00:12:46,892 --> 00:12:48,393

IT WAS GOOD, I GUESS.

321
00:12:50,103 --> 00:12:50,646
KINDA LIKED
THE BEST FRIEND CHARACTER.

322
00:12:50,729 --> 00:12:51,813
OH, THE WOMANIZER?!

323
00:12:51,897 --> 00:12:53,857
WHY?
DID YOU RELATE TO HIM?

324
00:12:53,941 --> 00:12:55,776
(SIGHS)
JUST IGNORE HER, CAM.

325
00:12:55,859 --> 00:12:57,444
NO. I JUST...
HE WAS, WELL, UM...

326
00:12:59,863 --> 00:13:01,865
I LIKED HOW HE REALIZED
HE WAS WASTING HIS LIFE,

327
00:13:01,949 --> 00:13:02,699
BUT IT WAS TOO LATE
TO CHANGE.

328
00:13:02,783 --> 00:13:04,910
EXACTLY.

329
00:13:04,993 --> 00:13:07,079
SO, CAM...
ARE YOU A VIRGIN?

SHE JUST GOT OVER
A TOUGH BREAK-UP.

AND I PUKED ALL OVER
OUR STUFFED ANIMALS.

353
00:14:17,608 --> 00:14:18,483
(SHUTTER SNAPS)

354
00:14:18,567 --> 00:14:20,068
AW... GROSS!

355
00:14:21,028 --> 00:14:22,446
SO WHAT ABOUT YOU?

356
00:14:22,529 --> 00:14:24,948
I'M SURE YOU HAVE SOME
GOOD BROTHER STORIES.

357
00:14:25,032 --> 00:14:27,034
WE USED TO PLAY STREET HOCKEY,
ME AND JUSTIN,

358
00:14:27,117 --> 00:14:30,412
AND NO MATTER HOW MUCH
I BEGGED HIM TO SHOOT,

359
00:14:30,495 --> 00:14:32,456
HE ALWAYS FORCED ME
TO PLAY GOALIE

360
00:14:32,539 --> 00:14:34,750
AND HE WOULD FIRED SHOT
AFTER SHOT AT MY FACE,

361
00:14:34,833 --> 00:14:36,210
AND MAN, DID IT HURT.

362
00:14:36,293 --> 00:14:38,337
(LAUGHS)
(SHUTTER SNAPS)

363
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:40,797
I REALLY MISS HIM.

364
00:14:40,881 --> 00:14:43,300
WELL, I GUESS THE HOCKEY GUYS
ARE LIKE YOUR BROTHERS NOW,

365
00:14:43,383 --> 00:14:44,384
RIGHT?

366
00:14:44,468 --> 00:14:45,969
UH, I GUESS...

367
00:14:47,596 --> 00:14:49,389
CAN I TELL YOU
A SECRET THOUGH?

368
00:14:51,433 --> 00:14:52,226
TONIGHT'S THE MOST FUN
I'VE HAD

369
00:14:52,309 --> 00:14:53,894
SINCE I'VE BEEN AT DEGRASSI.

370
00:14:55,979 --> 00:14:57,481
I HAVE A SECRET TOO.

371
00:14:59,024 --> 00:15:00,192
I DON'T LIKE HOCKEY.

372
00:15:00,275 --> 00:15:01,777
(LAUGHS)

373
00:15:03,946 --> 00:15:05,447
ME NEITHER.

374
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:10,953
UH, KATIE'S PROBABLY
GETTING WORRIED.

375
00:15:11,036 --> 00:15:14,498
WE SHOULD-
WE SHOULD GO FIND HER.

376
00:15:14,581 --> 00:15:16,083

00:15:22,881 --> 00:15:24,466

OKAY.

378
00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:26,051

379
00:15:27,427 --> 00:15:28,762
SORRY I DRAGGED YOU
ALL THE WAY HERE FOR A TIE.

380
00:15:28,846 --> 00:15:29,513
YOU WANNA STAY
FOR A DRINK?

381
00:15:29,596 --> 00:15:30,764
I HAVE A COUPLE OF MINUTES.

382
00:15:30,848 --> 00:15:32,808
QUALITY TIME WITH MY SON;

383
00:15:32,891 --> 00:15:33,517
HOW CAN I TURN
THAT DOWN?

384
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,102
SWEET. HERE.

385
00:15:38,063 --> 00:15:40,357

00:16:29,198 --> 00:16:30,699
DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY PEOPLE
READ THAT NEWSPAPER?

00:16:30,782 --> 00:16:32,701

00:16:43,587 --> 00:16:45,464
I HAVE TO REREAD IT.

411
00:16:45,547 --> 00:16:47,132
NO. NO,
YOU NEED TO READ IT.

THAT I HAVE BECOME

SO MUCH FOR ME, MOM,

YOU WOULD'VE TALKED TO ME FIRST

A LOT OF WORK.

(TEARY EXHALE)
I'M SORRY.

476
00:19:20,827 --> 00:19:22,955
MAYBE I'M JUST NOT
CUT OUT FOR THIS.

477
00:19:23,038 --> 00:19:25,874
I DIDN'T MEAN
TO SOUND HARSH, CLARE.

478
00:19:25,958 --> 00:19:28,085
IT'S YOUR FIRST TIME.
IT'S NOT ALL BAD.

479
00:19:28,168 --> 00:19:29,253
YOU DON'T HAVE TO SAY THAT.

480
00:19:29,336 --> 00:19:30,671
I'M NOT JUST SAYING THAT.

481
00:19:30,754 --> 00:19:32,256
YOU HAVE POTENTIAL.

482
00:19:34,299 --> 00:19:37,678
LOOK, IF YOU WANT,
WE CAN FINISH THIS TOGETHER.

483
00:19:37,761 --> 00:19:40,764
WE CAN STAY AS LATE
AS WE NEED TO.

484
00:19:40,848 --> 00:19:42,766
I WILL STAY,
AS LONG AS IT TAKES.

485
00:19:49,189 --> 00:19:50,607
MAYA:
IT WAS THIS EPIC MOMENT.

486
00:19:50,691 --> 00:19:52,568
WE LOCKED EYES,
WE LEANED IN.

487
00:19:52,651 --> 00:19:53,277
AND THEN?
AND THEN NOTHING.

488
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:55,362
NADA.

489
00:19:55,445 --> 00:19:56,071
WHAT? NO KISS?
WHAT ABOUT THE KISS?

490
00:19:56,154 --> 00:19:57,823
I DON'T KNOW.

491
00:19:57,906 --> 00:19:59,116
WHAT HAPPENED?
DOES MY BREATH STINK?

492
00:19:59,199 --> 00:20:00,784
EW! I DON'T THINK SO.

493
00:20:00,868 --> 00:20:01,743
(SIGHS) WHAT IF HE DOESN'T
LIKE ME, TOR?

494
00:20:01,827 --> 00:20:03,453
WHAT DO I DO?

495
00:20:03,537 --> 00:20:04,788
I'VE NEVER LIKED ANYBODY
THIS MUCH BEFORE.

496
00:20:04,872 --> 00:20:06,456
HE ASKED YOU OUT,
DIDN'T HE?

497
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:08,500
YEAH. BUT I HAD
TO MAKE THE PLANS.

498
00:20:08,584 --> 00:20:09,376
AND THEN KATIE
TAGGED ALONG.

499
00:20:09,459 --> 00:20:11,420
WHICH WAS MORTIFYING!

500
00:20:11,503 --> 00:20:12,421
WELL, NO WONDER
HE DIDN'T KISS YOU!

501
00:20:12,504 --> 00:20:14,214
BOYS LIKE TO BE
IN CHARGE,

502
00:20:14,298 --> 00:20:16,633
ESPECIALLY HOCKEY PLAYERS.

503
00:20:16,717 --> 00:20:20,220
THEY'RE LIKE ALPHA MALE,
MANLY MEN.

504
00:20:20,304 --> 00:20:21,805
SO I MADE CAM FEEL
UN-MANLY.

505
00:20:23,432 --> 00:20:25,350
WELL, NEXT TIME,

506
00:20:25,434 --> 00:20:28,145
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO
IS LET HIM TAKE THE LEAD.

507
00:20:28,228 --> 00:20:30,981
WELL, HOW DO I MAKE SURE
THERE IS A NEXT TIME?

508
00:20:31,064 --> 00:20:33,108
OKAY, WE NEED
A BETTER WORD THERE.

509
00:20:33,192 --> 00:20:34,985
CLARE:
HMM...

510
00:20:35,068 --> 00:20:36,653

NO, NO! STRIVE!

514
00:20:47,414 --> 00:20:49,666

00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:51,835
THANK YOU.

516
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:53,420
I FEEL SO SILLY
ABOUT CRYING BEFORE.

517
00:20:53,504 --> 00:20:54,922
(LAUGHS) IT'S OKAY.
I GET IT.

518
00:20:55,005 --> 00:20:56,673
I WAS A COFFEE GOPHER
ONCE, TOO.

519
00:20:57,216 --> 00:20:58,717
NO.

520
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:01,303
WE ALL HAVE TO PAY
OUR DUES.

521
00:21:01,386 --> 00:21:02,888
I JUST WANT THIS SO BAD.

522
00:21:06,808 --> 00:21:09,520
THERE'S NOTHING WRONG
WITH KNOWING WHAT YOU WANT.

523
00:21:09,603 --> 00:21:11,104
IF I'VE LEARNED ANYTHING
TONIGHT,

524
00:21:11,188 --> 00:21:13,440
IT'S THAT I'VE STILL GOT
