1
00:00:02,711 --> 00:00:04,880
ELI:
THE BIRDS ARE SINGING,
THE SUN IS SHINING,

2
00:00:04,963 --> 00:00:07,132
A GENTLE BREEZE IS CREATING
A NICE WIND MACHINE EFFECT.

3
00:00:07,216 --> 00:00:09,176
CLARE:
(LAUGHS) WELL,
I'M GLAD TO SEE

4
00:00:09,259 --> 00:00:10,385
YOUR CINEMATIC IMAGINATION
IS ALIVE AND WELL

5
00:00:10,469 --> 00:00:12,095
ON THIS AUSPICIOUS
MORNING.

6
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:13,305
(SIGHS)
I'M FEELING GOOD, CLARE.

7
00:00:13,388 --> 00:00:14,890
I'M GONNA NAIL THIS
NYU INTERVIEW.

8
00:00:14,973 --> 00:00:16,475
CLARE:
OF COURSE YOU WILL.

9
00:00:16,558 --> 00:00:17,476
YOU'VE BEEN ON
SUCH A STRONG PATH ALL YEAR.

10
00:00:17,559 --> 00:00:18,393
NOTHING'S GONNA GET
IN MY WAY.

11
00:00:18,477 --> 00:00:19,978
TALIA:
ELI!

12
00:00:20,854 --> 00:00:23,232
I HAVE A GIFT FOR YOU!

13
00:00:23,315 --> 00:00:24,274
THOUGHT YOU MIGHT WANT
YOUR SHIRT BACK.

14
00:00:24,358 --> 00:00:25,859
(BELL RINGS)

15
00:00:26,735 --> 00:00:28,237
STILL COMING DOWN?

16
00:00:30,906 --> 00:00:32,074
OKAY,
PLEASE DON'T BE WORRIED.

17
00:00:32,157 --> 00:00:34,284
COMING DOWN FROM WHAT?

18
00:00:34,368 --> 00:00:35,786
OKAY, I TOOK A BREAK FROM
EDITING THE VIDEO YEARBOOK

19
00:00:35,869 --> 00:00:37,454
AND WENT TO THAT ART PARTY
WITH JAKE AND MO.

20
00:00:37,538 --> 00:00:39,456
AND YOU SMOKED WEED
AGAIN.

21
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:40,165
LOOK, I DON'T WANT YOU
TO FREAK OUT,

22
00:00:40,249 --> 00:00:41,750
BUT I DIDN'T... SMOKE.

23
00:00:43,919 --> 00:00:45,420
I TOOK MDMA.

24
00:00:47,297 --> 00:00:50,092
OKAY, NOW I'M WORRIED.

25
00:00:50,175 --> 00:00:52,135
I PROMISE
IT WON'T HAPPEN AGAIN.

26
00:00:54,304 --> 00:00:56,223
WE SAID NOTHING WOULD
GET IN YOUR WAY.

DR. TARA:
YOU'RE WELCOME.

47
00:02:01,914 --> 00:02:03,248
REMEMBER MY SISTER,
KATIE?
I DO.

48
00:02:03,332 --> 00:02:04,583
NICE TO SEE YOU
AGAIN.

49
00:02:04,666 --> 00:02:05,584
KATIE:
HI. UM...

50
00:02:05,667 --> 00:02:07,252
THANKS FOR EVERYTHING.

51
00:02:07,336 --> 00:02:08,337
WE WON'T TAKE UP
ANY MORE OF YOUR TIME.

52
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:10,589
HEY!

53
00:02:10,672 --> 00:02:12,174
WHAT?
(FORCEFUL WHISPER)
YOU PROMISED!

54
00:02:14,885 --> 00:02:16,261
SO AFTER BLOWING
MY CHANCES

55
00:02:16,345 --> 00:02:18,222
AT BEING ON
THE NATIONAL SOCCER TEAM,

56
00:02:18,305 --> 00:02:21,266
AND THEN MY STUDENT COUNCIL
PRESIDENCY,

57
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:23,185
UM, JAKE WAS MY ROCK.

58
00:02:23,268 --> 00:02:24,436
I HELPED HIM
WITH HIS GARDEN,

59
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:26,021
WE LAUGHED A LOT...

60
00:02:26,104 --> 00:02:29,107
AND... I HATE MYSELF
FOR RUINING IT.

61
00:02:30,859 --> 00:02:32,486
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?

62
00:02:32,569 --> 00:02:34,029
I KNOW YOU HAVE MORE
IMPORTANT THINGS TO DO

63
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:36,323
THAN TALK ABOUT
MY LOVE LIFE.

64
00:02:36,406 --> 00:02:37,282
LOOK, WHEN YOU LOSE SOMETHING
THAT YOU LOVE,

65
00:02:37,366 --> 00:02:40,536
IT'S REALLY...
IT'S TOUGH.

66
00:02:40,619 --> 00:02:43,247
BUT IT'S NEVER TOO LATE
TO START AGAIN AND REBUILD.

67
00:02:45,332 --> 00:02:47,334
I'VE TRIED TO APOLOGIZE
TO JAKE,

68
00:02:47,417 --> 00:02:49,378
BUT HE...
HE WON'T EVEN LOOK AT ME.

69
00:02:49,461 --> 00:02:50,921
TELL ME SOMETHING,

70
00:02:51,004 --> 00:02:53,131
WHAT DO YOU THINK
WOULD MAKE YOU FEEL BETTER?

71
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:58,262
IF I FINISH PROCESSING
THE SIMULATOR ON TIME,

72
00:02:58,345 --> 00:02:59,763
WE CAN REACH MARS
BY THIS AFTERNOON.

73
00:02:59,847 --> 00:03:00,347
OOH! DO YOU THINK
WE'LL GET TO SEE

74
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:02,307
THE CURIOSITY ROVER?

75
00:03:02,391 --> 00:03:04,184
I HAVEN'T PROGRAMMED
IT YET, BUT-

76
00:03:04,268 --> 00:03:05,602
WAIT. HOW DO YOU KNOW ABOUT
THE CURIOSITY ROVER?

77
00:03:05,686 --> 00:03:06,603
I GUESS YOU'RE RUBBING OFF
ON ME.

78
00:03:06,687 --> 00:03:08,230
AND DON'T FORGET,

79
00:03:08,313 --> 00:03:10,023
I GOT INTO THE GIFTED PROGRAM
TOO, REMEMBER?

80
00:03:15,904 --> 00:03:17,656
HI!

81
00:03:17,739 --> 00:03:18,907
ARE WE INTERRUPTING?

82
00:03:18,991 --> 00:03:21,410
YEAH.
NOT AT ALL!

83
00:03:21,493 --> 00:03:22,953
DALLAS:
SO ARE YOU GUYS DATING?

84
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:25,372
IT'S NOT OFFICIAL
OR ANYTHING.

85
00:03:25,455 --> 00:03:26,748
CONNOR:
WELL, CONSIDERING WE'VE BEEN
ON ONE DATE,

86
00:03:26,832 --> 00:03:28,208
AND HAVE COMMITTED
TO A SECOND,

87
00:03:28,292 --> 00:03:30,169
THAT TECHNICALLY QUALIFIES
AS DATING.

88
00:03:30,252 --> 00:03:31,128
WE ALSO KISSED
ON THE LIPS,

89
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:33,422
AND YOU TOLD ME
NOT TO STOP.

90
00:03:33,505 --> 00:03:35,966
JENNA:
OKAY, CONNOR,
THAT'S PERSONAL!

91
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:36,466
ALL RIGHT, I'LL GO SAVE US
SOME SEATS AT THE FRONT.

92
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:38,844
YEAH.

93
00:03:38,927 --> 00:03:41,221
YOU DIDN'T TELL ME
YOU GUYS KISSED!

94
00:03:41,305 --> 00:03:41,930
WHERE DID HE TAKE YOU
ON YOUR DATE?

95
00:03:42,014 --> 00:03:42,890
OH, THEY WENT TO SPACE.

96
00:03:42,973 --> 00:03:44,057
IS THAT A EUPHEMISM?

97
00:03:44,141 --> 00:03:45,475
JENNA:
NO, DALLAS.

98
00:03:45,559 --> 00:03:46,560
BECKY:
OH! ARE YOU GONNA
GET MARRIED

99
00:03:46,643 --> 00:03:47,769
AND MAKE CUTE LITTLE
ASTRONAUT BABIES?

100
00:03:47,853 --> 00:03:49,354
THAT'S WHY I DIDN'T
TELL ANYONE!

101
00:03:49,438 --> 00:03:51,023
YOU GUYS ARE
SO ANNOYING.

102
00:03:55,819 --> 00:03:59,156
FIONA:
FAVOURITE ITALIAN
NEO-REALIST FILM?

103
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:00,324
WHILE THE "BICYCLE THIEF"
HAS ITS MERITS,

104
00:04:00,407 --> 00:04:02,576
I'D HAVE TO GO WITH
"UMBERTO D."

105
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:04,119
YOU KNOW, DE SICA TOOK
SIMPLE CHARACTER STUDY

106
00:04:04,203 --> 00:04:06,371
AND TURNED IT
INTO HEARTBREAKING DRAMA.

107
00:04:06,455 --> 00:04:07,831
OKAY. NO IDEA
WHAT YOU JUST SAID,

108
00:04:07,915 --> 00:04:10,876
BUT IT SOUNDED
BELLISSIMO.

109
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:11,835
OH! BY THE WAY,
YOU DON'T HAVE TO FINISH

110
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:13,837
THE VIDEO YEARBOOK.

111
00:04:13,921 --> 00:04:16,256
UH, SO IN TRUFFAUT'S-
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

112
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:17,508
YOU KNOW,
I KNOW I'M BEHIND,

113
00:04:17,591 --> 00:04:18,050
BUT AS SOON AS
MY INTERVIEW'S OVER,

114
00:04:18,133 --> 00:04:19,384
I'LL FINISH IT.

115
00:04:19,468 --> 00:04:22,179
I'M RELIEVING YOU
OF THE BURDEN.

116
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:23,555
WHAT ARE YOU NOT
TELLING ME?

117
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:25,641
MAYBE YOU SHOULD
JUST TALK TO CLARE.

118
00:04:27,809 --> 00:04:29,853
SHE DOESN'T THINK
IT'S A GOOD IDEA.

119
00:04:29,937 --> 00:04:30,437
BUT SHE'S THE ONE
WHO GOT ME TO DO THE VIDEO

120
00:04:30,521 --> 00:04:31,230
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

121
00:04:31,313 --> 00:04:32,814
I KNOW, BUT UH...

122
00:04:34,483 --> 00:04:36,610
SHE DOESN'T THINK
YOU CAN HANDLE IT RIGHT NOW.

123
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:40,322
(CHAIR SCRAPES BACK
FORCEFULLY)

124
00:04:46,578 --> 00:04:48,747
UH, MY CHILI. HEY!

125
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:49,373
WELL, IT'S NOT
A GOOD IDEA.

126
00:04:49,456 --> 00:04:50,290
YOU KNOW, SO SPICY.

127
00:04:50,374 --> 00:04:52,376
BUT I LIKE IT.

128
00:04:52,459 --> 00:04:54,461
WELL, I DON'T THINK
YOU CAN HANDLE IT.

129
00:04:54,545 --> 00:04:56,296
SINCE WHEN DO YOU DICTATE
WHICH HOT LUNCH ITEMS

130
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:58,090
I CAN AND CANNOT HANDLE?

131
00:04:58,173 --> 00:04:59,925
DOESN'T FEEL GOOD,
DOES IT?

132
00:05:05,389 --> 00:05:06,723
THE LAST TIME YOU TRIED
EDITING CAM FOOTAGE,

133
00:05:06,807 --> 00:05:08,475
IT LED YOU TO DO DRUGS.

134
00:05:08,559 --> 00:05:09,560
I WAS JUST LOOKING OUT
FOR YOU.

135
00:05:09,643 --> 00:05:11,311
YOU'RE MEDDLING.

136
00:05:11,395 --> 00:05:12,688
OKAY, THAT IS NOT FAIR.
I DO IT BECAUSE I CARE.

137
00:05:12,771 --> 00:05:15,315
I'M FINISHING IT.

138
00:05:15,399 --> 00:05:15,983
MAYBE YOU SHOULD POSTPONE
YOUR INTERVIEW

139
00:05:16,066 --> 00:05:16,817
UNTIL THIS IS ALL OVER.

140
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:18,110
YOU MEAN THE INTERVIEW

141
00:05:18,193 --> 00:05:22,030
THAT STARTS
IN FIFTEEN MINUTES?

142
00:05:22,114 --> 00:05:24,157
ENJOY YOUR CHILI.
YOU CAN DO IT!

143
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:30,122
HI.

144
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:35,043
I'M SO SORRY ABOUT
THE WHOLE BABY THING.

145
00:05:35,127 --> 00:05:37,254
I DIDN'T MEAN TO SAY
YOU'D GET PREGNANT AGAIN.

146
00:05:38,881 --> 00:05:40,549
I KNOW.

147
00:05:40,632 --> 00:05:42,050
THAT WAS JUST INTENSE.

148
00:05:42,134 --> 00:05:44,136
YOU HEARD EVERYONE,
EVEN YOU.

149
00:05:44,219 --> 00:05:46,096
IT WASN'T FAIR OF US
TO TEASE.

150
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:49,266
BUT IF YOU FELT
SO UNCOMFORTABLE,

151
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:53,061
MAYBE DATING CONNOR'S
NOT A GOOD IDEA.

152
00:05:53,145 --> 00:05:54,730
MAYBE HE'S ALL WRONG FOR ME
AND I JUST CAN'T SEE IT

153
00:05:54,813 --> 00:05:56,106
BECAUSE IT FELT SO GOOD

154
00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:58,358
TO HANG OUT WITH A NICE GUY
FOR ONCE.

155
00:05:58,442 --> 00:06:01,028
LOOK, ONLY YOU KNOW
WHETHER YOU LIKE HIM OR NOT.

156
00:06:01,111 --> 00:06:03,363
BUT BEFORE YOU COMMIT...
I MADE A MISTAKE.

157
00:06:05,866 --> 00:06:07,159
YOU KNOW WHEN I TOLD YOU
TO STAY AWAY FROM MY BROTHER?

158
00:06:07,242 --> 00:06:08,785
YOUR BROTHER
WAS A JERK TO ME.

159
00:06:08,869 --> 00:06:10,871
I MIGHT BE BIASED,
BUT HE'S CHANGED.

160
00:06:10,954 --> 00:06:12,664
PLUS, HE'S SOCIAL
AND FUN.

161
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:17,127
I THINK YOU TWO WOULD BE
PERFECT TOGETHER.

162
00:06:17,211 --> 00:06:19,963
THANKS A LOT, BECKY.

163
00:06:20,047 --> 00:06:23,258
NOW I REALLY DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO DO.

164
00:06:23,342 --> 00:06:24,343
SIMPSON:
ONCE AGAIN,
AS PER LAST WEEK'S MEETING,

165
00:06:24,426 --> 00:06:26,428
WE'VE AGREED TO SIDEBAR
ANY CONVERSATION

166
00:06:26,512 --> 00:06:27,721
ABOUT SUGARY BEVERAGES
IN THE CAFETERIA

167
00:06:27,804 --> 00:06:28,847
UNTIL WE END...

168
00:06:28,931 --> 00:06:30,390
WHAT'RE YOU DOING HERE?

169
00:06:30,474 --> 00:06:31,725
MARISOL SAID YOU WERE TRYING
TO GET MY GARDEN BACK.

170
00:06:31,808 --> 00:06:33,018
I MEAN, HOW COULD YOU
NOT TELL ME?

171
00:06:33,101 --> 00:06:34,186
WELL, YOU IGNORE ME
IN THE HALLS.

172
00:06:34,269 --> 00:06:36,772
HOW WAS I SUPPOSED
TO TELL YOU?

173
00:06:36,855 --> 00:06:37,773
SIMPSON:
ALL RIGHT,
BEFORE WE MOVE ON,

174
