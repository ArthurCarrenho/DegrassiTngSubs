00:00:01,251 --> 00:00:02,294
THERE'S NOT A LOT OF TIME
BEFORE THE BIG EVENT.

2
00:00:02,377 --> 00:00:03,170
EVERYONE HAS TO KNOW
THEIR ROLES,

3
00:00:03,253 --> 00:00:05,255
EVERYTHING MUST BE PERFECT!

5
00:00:06,173 --> 00:00:07,674

ADAM:
WHATCHA TALKING ABOUT, ELI?

7
00:00:10,886 --> 00:00:13,555
I DON'T THINK IT'S THE MUSICAL.

8
00:00:13,639 --> 00:00:16,058
CLARE'S NEWSPAPER INTERNSHIP
DIDN'T WORK OUT.

9
00:00:16,141 --> 00:00:18,060
SHE'S PRETTY UPSET ABOUT IT
BUT WE'RE GONNA CHEER HER UP,

10
00:00:18,143 --> 00:00:20,812
WITH A SURPRISE 17TH
BIRTHDAY PARTY TONIGHT,

11
00:00:20,896 --> 00:00:22,981
AND YOU'RE ALL GONNA HELP.

12
00:00:23,065 --> 00:00:24,900
UM...I BARELY KNOW CLARE,

13
00:00:24,983 --> 00:00:26,235
AND I DON'T REALLY CARE
ABOUT HER BIRTHDAY,

14
00:00:26,318 --> 00:00:28,487
SO WHY AM I EXPECTED TO HELP?

15
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:30,030
BECAUSE THE PARTY WILL BE
AT YOUR LOFT.

16
00:00:30,113 --> 00:00:31,907
AND YOU'RE PLANNING IT.

17
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:33,867
I DON'T THINK SO.

18
00:00:33,951 --> 00:00:37,412
I WILL GIVE YOU MONEY TO SPEND.

19
00:00:37,496 --> 00:00:40,207
LAST MINUTE PARTY PLANNING
WITH A BUDGET?!

20
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:41,583
WHY DIDN'T YOU SAY SO?

21
00:00:41,667 --> 00:00:43,168
ELI:
AND REMEMBER,
IT'S A SURPRISE.

22
00:00:45,629 --> 00:00:46,964
WELL, YOU'RE TAKING THIS
WHOLE CLARE-ASHER THING

23
00:00:47,047 --> 00:00:48,841
SHOCKINGLY WELL.

24
00:00:48,924 --> 00:00:49,675
THAT JERK OBVIOUSLY
DOESN'T KNOW A GREAT WRITER

25
00:00:49,758 --> 00:00:52,469
WHEN HE SEES ONE.

26
00:00:52,553 --> 00:00:54,429
YEAH, IT MUST'VE BEEN
REALLY HARD FOR CLARE

27
00:00:54,513 --> 00:00:56,515
TO ADMIT THAT SOMEONE THOUGHT
HER WRITING WAS SUB-PAR.

28
00:00:56,598 --> 00:00:59,685
SO YOU'LL GET CLARE
TO THE PARTY FOR ME?

29
00:00:59,768 --> 00:01:02,229

WITH A SPA BIRTHDAY TREAT.

NO, ACTUALLY, I WON.

67
00:02:22,226 --> 00:02:23,977
WE WENT OUT TO CELEBRATE.

68
00:02:24,061 --> 00:02:25,354
YOU WON?
WHY DIDN'T YOU CALL ME?

69
00:02:25,437 --> 00:02:27,689
SORRY, I GOT A LITTLE
SWEPT UP.

70
00:02:27,773 --> 00:02:29,149
SORRY IF YOU FEEL LIKE
I BLEW YOU OFF.

WELL, I THOUGHT YOU'D BE
MAD SINCE I DITCHED YOU.

GOT THE MESSAGE FROM JULIET

ABOUT HER FAKING HER DEATH?

TOO MUCH TIME WITH ELI.

THINKING ABOUT THE OTHER FIRST.

YOU BREAK UP?

NOT TO CALL YOU.

FEEL MUCH BETTER.

TOLD YOU ALL THIS

ABOUT?

ARE TALKING.

TO MOVE HOME,

108
00:03:51,607 --> 00:03:53,567
AND GO BACK TO SCHOOL.

109
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:54,610

YOUR DECISION,

114

THAT'S NOT MY FAULT.

115
00:04:03,744 --> 00:04:05,454

ON MY SIDE!

FEEL LIKE CELEBRATING

TAKEN AWAY FROM YOU?

NO! THE ARTICLE YOU AND CLARE
WROTE WAS AMAZING.

176
00:06:34,686 --> 00:06:37,648
WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU?

177
00:06:37,731 --> 00:06:41,401
I WANTED TO TALK TO YOU
ABOUT...HER.

178
00:06:41,485 --> 00:06:43,570
I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING TO SAY.

179
00:06:43,654 --> 00:06:46,406
IN FACT, I'M LATE
FOR A PRESS CONFERENCE.

180
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:47,407
ELI:
CLARE LOVED THIS INTERNSHIP,

181
00:06:47,491 --> 00:06:49,117
SHE WAS LEARNING SO MUCH
FROM YOU.

182
00:06:49,201 --> 00:06:50,911
NOT ENOUGH TO KEEP HER JOB,
UNFORTUNATELY.

183
00:06:50,994 --> 00:06:53,872
WELL, IS THERE ANY WAY
YOU'D CONSIDER RE-HIRING HER?

184
00:06:53,956 --> 00:06:55,582
THIS IS THIS A JOKE.

185
00:06:55,666 --> 00:06:59,002
SHE WOULD BE SO GRATEFUL
FOR A SECOND CHANCE.

186
00:06:59,086 --> 00:07:01,296
YOU DON'T KNOW, DO YOU?

187
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:03,507
ELI, CLARE IS OBSESSED
WITH ME.

188
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:05,634
WELL SURE,
SHE IDOLIZES YOU.

189
00:07:05,717 --> 00:07:07,970
NO, SHE IS IN LOVE WITH ME,
IT CAUSED A LOT OF PROBLEMS.

190
00:07:08,053 --> 00:07:10,556
THE ONLY SOLUTION WAS
FOR HER TO BE FIRED.

191
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:12,140
YOU'RE KIDDING ME.

192
00:07:13,475 --> 00:07:15,519
SORRY YOU HAD TO FIND OUT
LIKE THIS.

193
00:07:19,523 --> 00:07:21,024
(HORN HONKS, CARS RUMBLE)

194
00:07:22,526 --> 00:07:23,944
FIONA: HEY.
DREW: OH, HEY.

195
00:07:24,027 --> 00:07:26,280
I BOUGHT YOU A KIDS' COMBO,

196
00:07:26,363 --> 00:07:28,490
AND ACCIDENTALLY GOT YOU
THE GIRLS' TOY.

197
00:07:28,574 --> 00:07:31,118
THAT'S UNEXPECTED,
BUT UH, THANKS.

198
00:07:31,201 --> 00:07:34,162
WHAT?

199
00:07:34,246 --> 00:07:35,873
I'M HOSTING AN EMERGENCY
SURPRISE BIRTHDAY PARTY

200
00:07:35,956 --> 00:07:37,875
FOR CLARE EDWARDS
AT THE LOFT TONIGHT.

201
00:07:37,958 --> 00:07:39,418
AND ALSO,
THIS IS AWKWARD,

202
00:07:39,501 --> 00:07:41,962
HENCE THE FREE LUNCH,

203
00:07:42,045 --> 00:07:42,921
CLARE'S STEP-BROTHER JAKE
IS BRINGING

204
00:07:43,005 --> 00:07:44,506
HIS NEW GIRLFRIEND
TO THE PARTY.

205
00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:46,842
KATIE.

206
00:07:46,925 --> 00:07:49,052
KATIE?
WHAT, THEY'RE DATING NOW?

207
00:07:49,136 --> 00:07:50,846
WOW, HE'S BRAVE.

208
00:07:50,929 --> 00:07:52,514
YEAH, SO CAN YOU BE
SCARCE TONIGHT?

209
00:07:52,598 --> 00:07:54,516
KEEP THINGS TENSION FREE?

210
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:57,477
FINE. OH, JUST A HEADS UP,
I MIGHT BE MOVING OUT.

211
00:07:57,561 --> 00:07:59,438
OKAY OVERREACTOR,

212
00:07:59,521 --> 00:08:01,190
YOU CAN COME TO THE PARTY
IF YOU WANT.

213
00:08:01,273 --> 00:08:03,317
NO, MY MOM AND BIANCA
WANT ME BACK HOME,

214
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:06,236
AND IN SCHOOL.

215
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,362
I KEEP TRYING TO PROVE TO THEM
THAT I DID THE RIGHT THING,

216
00:08:07,446 --> 00:08:09,364
IT JUST BACKFIRES ON ME.

217
00:08:09,448 --> 00:08:10,908
SO YOU'RE GIVING UP?

218
00:08:10,991 --> 00:08:12,159
I BOUGHT A MOTORCYCLE.

219
00:08:12,242 --> 00:08:14,953
SO? I BOUGHT A VESPA ONCE.

220
00:08:15,037 --> 00:08:16,747
DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY TIMES
I'VE BEEN TOLD TO GO HOME,

221
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:18,707
GIVE UP, LET SOMEONE ELSE
TAKE CARE OF ME?

222
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:20,834
MORE TIMES THAN
I CAN COUNT.

223
00:08:20,918 --> 00:08:21,960
IF YOU WANT PEOPLE
TO TAKE YOU SERIOUSLY,

224
00:08:22,044 --> 00:08:23,545
THEN BE SERIOUS.

225
00:08:24,379 --> 00:08:26,340
(PHONE BEEPS)

226
00:08:26,423 --> 00:08:27,841
OOH! I'VE GOT
A CONFETTI CANNON

WHERE'S SHE OFF TO?

230
00:08:34,723 --> 00:08:36,850
UH, SHE'S PLANNING
A BIRTHDAY PARTY

231
00:08:36,934 --> 00:08:39,269
FOR THIS GIRL CLARE
AT OUR HOUSE TONIGHT.

232
00:08:39,353 --> 00:08:40,562
CLARE EDWARDS?

233
00:08:40,646 --> 00:08:42,523
YEAH, WHY?
YOU KNOW HER?

234
00:08:42,606 --> 00:08:45,234
SURE, WE'RE LIKE, BFFS!

235
00:08:45,317 --> 00:08:47,861
REALLY?
I AM SO OUT OF THE LOOP.

236
00:08:47,945 --> 00:08:49,613
YEAH, I SHOULD STOP BY
THAT PARTY.

237
00:08:49,696 --> 00:08:52,324
WISH CLARE A HAPPY BIRTHDAY.

IT'S SO WEIRD THAT
HE'S NOT HERE YET.

THEY DIDN'T SEE YOU,
DID THEY?

253
00:09:33,156 --> 00:09:34,449
OH, I HATE SPOILERS!

WHAT'S WRONG?

257
00:09:41,123 --> 00:09:44,126
CLARE'S IN LOVE WITH HER
JOURNALISM MENTOR.

258
00:09:44,209 --> 00:09:46,003
NOW I HAVE TO TALK TO HER
AND SEE WHAT'S UP.

259
00:09:46,086 --> 00:09:46,587
FIONA:
OKAY, MAYBE DON'T BRING IT UP
TONIGHT?

260
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:48,172
IT'S HER BIRTHDAY.

I THINK THIS IS THE PLACE.

LIKE A SPA.

SURPRISE!

264
00:09:57,514 --> 00:09:58,640

YOU WHAT?!

274
00:10:34,134 --> 00:10:35,344
I WENT TO "THE INTERPRETER"
TO SEE IF HE CAN GIVE YOU

275
00:10:35,427 --> 00:10:37,137
A SECOND SHOT.

276
00:10:37,221 --> 00:10:38,722
AND WHAT DID HE TELL YOU?

277
00:10:38,805 --> 00:10:40,641
YOU WERE IN LOVE
WITH HIM.

278
00:10:40,724 --> 00:10:43,393
OBSESSED, HE SAID,
AND THAT'S WHY YOU GOT FIRED.

279
00:10:43,477 --> 00:10:44,895
IT'S NOT TRUE.

HE GIVE YOU BEER?

00:11:25,352 --> 00:11:26,979
SHUT UP!

00:11:27,062 --> 00:11:28,230
DALLAS:
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO ABOUT IT?

298
00:11:28,313 --> 00:11:29,648
WRITE ANOTHER ARTICLE
IN THE SCHOOL PAPER?

299
00:11:29,731 --> 00:11:31,817
CAN YOU JUST LEAVE?!

300
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:34,194
OOH WEEE!
THIS IS DRAMATIC!

301
00:11:34,278 --> 00:11:37,364
DID CLARE FINALLY FESS UP
ABOUT HER MENTOR?

302
00:11:37,447 --> 00:11:39,157
ACTUALLY, YOU KNOW WHAT?
NEVER MIND.

303
00:11:39,241 --> 00:11:40,742
I CAN KEEP A SECRET.

304
00:11:42,035 --> 00:11:43,954
THERE IS MORE, I KNEW IT!

305
00:11:44,037 --> 00:11:46,081
WHAT HAPPENED BETWEEN YOU
AND ASHER?

306
00:11:46,164 --> 00:11:47,916
TELL ME!

307
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,501
I CAN'T.

308
00:11:55,966 --> 00:11:57,509
ALLI:
ELI, YOU CAN'T LEAVE,
IT'S NOT WHAT YOU THINK!

309
00:11:57,593 --> 00:11:58,468
HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO KNOW
WHAT TO THINK?

310
00:11:58,552 --> 00:12:00,012
SHE'S BEEN LYING TO ME
FOR WEEKS!

311
00:12:00,095 --> 00:12:01,054
CLARE IS COMPLETELY MESSED UP
RIGHT NOW,

312
00:12:01,138 --> 00:12:02,306
SHE NEEDS YOU!

313
00:12:02,389 --> 00:12:03,891
SHE WON'T EVEN TALK TO ME!

314
00:12:03,974 --> 00:12:05,475
SO MAKE HER!

315
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:07,811
PLEASE!

316
00:12:10,647 --> 00:12:12,149
BIANCA:
OOH! OOH!

317
00:12:13,692 --> 00:12:15,110
BE RIGHT BACK, MAN.

318
00:12:15,194 --> 00:12:16,695
DREW: HEY.
BIANCA: HI!

319
00:12:19,364 --> 00:12:21,825
THANKS FOR COMING.

320
00:12:21,909 --> 00:12:24,369
I TALKED TO MY MOM, AND SHE
GAVE ME A LOT TO THINK ABOUT.

321
00:12:24,453 --> 00:12:26,079
ABOUT MY SITUATION,

322
00:12:26,163 --> 00:12:28,874
ABOUT US.

323
00:12:28,957 --> 00:12:31,835
SHE THINKS YOU NEED ME
TO BE MORE SERIOUS.

324
00:12:31,919 --> 00:12:33,295
I GUESS I DO.

325
00:12:33,378 --> 00:12:35,964
OKAY.

326
00:12:36,048 --> 00:12:38,717
THEN, LET'S HAVE A SERIOUS
CONVERSATION, BIANCA.

327
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,302
SIT DOWN.

328
00:12:41,637 --> 00:12:43,138
BIANCA:
OKAY...

329
00:12:45,474 --> 00:12:47,476
I LOVE YOU.

330
00:12:47,559 --> 00:12:49,561
AND I WANT TO SPEND THE REST
OF MY LIFE WITH YOU.

331
00:12:49,645 --> 00:12:51,146
DREW...

332
00:12:53,857 --> 00:12:56,777
WILL YOU,
BIANCA L. DESOUSA,

333
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:59,279
MAKE ME THE HAPPIEST
MAN ALIVE,

334
00:12:59,363 --> 00:13:01,198
AND...

335
00:13:01,281 --> 00:13:03,200
OPEN A JOINT SAVINGS
BANK ACCOUNT WITH ME?

336
00:13:04,368 --> 00:13:06,995
WHAT?!

337
00:13:07,079 --> 00:13:08,539
I'M GONNA DEPOSIT ALL
MY COMMISSION INTO IT.

338
00:13:08,622 --> 00:13:10,332
IT'S FOR YOUR TUITION,

339
00:13:10,415 --> 00:13:13,252
CAR REPAIRS,
WHATEVER WE NEED.

340
00:13:13,335 --> 00:13:15,254
I'M GONNA TAKE CARE OF US,
I PROMISE.

341
00:13:22,135 --> 00:13:24,263
THERE'S ONLY ABOUT
A HUNDRED DOLLARS IN THERE NOW,

342
00:13:24,346 --> 00:13:27,432
BUT THERE'LL BE MORE ONCE
I SELL THE MOTORCYCLE TOMORROW.

343
00:13:27,516 --> 00:13:28,809
OH, YOU'RE GONNA SELL IT?

344
00:13:28,892 --> 00:13:30,394
CONCUSSIONS, REMEMBER?

345
00:13:32,062 --> 00:13:34,022
WELL, I DON'T HAVE
ANY CONCUSSIONS.

346
00:13:36,859 --> 00:13:38,235
DAVE:
THERE'S MY GIRL! OH!
