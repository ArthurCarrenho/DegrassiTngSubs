00:08:03,567 --> 00:08:03,984
YOUR BREAK-UP IS INTERFERING
WITH MY RELATIONSHIP

178
00:08:04,067 --> 00:08:05,777
WITH JENNA.

179
00:08:05,861 --> 00:08:06,528
ELI, YOU NEED TO GET
BACK TOGETHER WITH CLARE.

180
00:08:06,612 --> 00:08:08,447
WHAT?

181
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:09,364
YOUR BREAK-UP IS INTERFERING
WITH MY-

182
00:08:09,448 --> 00:08:12,117
NO, CONNOR,
I HEARD YOU.

183
00:08:12,201 --> 00:08:13,827
THIS IS REALLY
NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS.

184
00:08:13,911 --> 00:08:16,496
ELI, YOU'RE A MESS.

185
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:18,123
I JUST SPILLED SOME PUDDING
ON MY T-SHIRT.

186
00:08:18,207 --> 00:08:20,334
NO! YOU REMIND ME OF ME
WHEN I WAS UNHAPPY -

187
00:08:20,417 --> 00:08:22,294
ALONE, ON A COMPUTER,
SMELLY.

188
00:08:26,089 --> 00:08:27,758
I'M MISERABLE.

189
00:08:27,841 --> 00:08:29,551
TALK TO CLARE.
TELL HER THAT.

190
00:08:29,635 --> 00:08:33,388
OH, SHE'S NEVER GONNA
TAKE ME BACK.

191
00:08:33,472 --> 00:08:34,681
I MIGHT'VE LOST CLARE
FOR GOOD.

192
00:08:34,765 --> 00:08:36,600
MAYBE NOT.

193
00:08:36,683 --> 00:08:37,476
I CAN TALK TO ALLI
AND JENNA,

194
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:39,228
FIND OUT WHERE SHE STANDS.

195
00:08:41,897 --> 00:08:44,274
WHY DO YOU CARE SO MUCH
ABOUT ME AND CLARE?

196
00:08:48,487 --> 00:08:51,532
BECAUSE I DON'T WANT JENNA
TO ASK ME FOR A BREAK.

197
00:08:55,452 --> 00:08:56,954
(THUNDER RUMBLES,
RAIN PATTERS)

198
00:09:08,090 --> 00:09:09,633
MAYA:
DON'T GO!

199
00:09:09,716 --> 00:09:10,759
ZIG:
MAYA, I DON'T WANNA FIGHT
WITH YOU!

200
00:09:10,843 --> 00:09:12,594
I DON'T WANNA FIGHT
WITH YOU EITHER!

201
00:09:12,678 --> 00:09:13,554
REALLY? BECAUSE THIS
PRETTY MUCH SOUNDS

202
00:09:13,637 --> 00:09:15,556
LIKE WE'RE FIGHTING!

203
00:09:15,639 --> 00:09:17,140
(HUFFS) LOOK, I'M SORRY
I POSTED THE VIDEO, OKAY?

204
00:09:17,224 --> 00:09:19,101
I TOOK IT DOWN.
IT'S OVER.

205
00:09:19,184 --> 00:09:20,727
YOU KNOW,
I CAN'T BELIEVE

206
00:09:20,811 --> 00:09:22,104
YOU ACTUALLY LIKE
THAT TOOL HARRY.

207
00:09:22,187 --> 00:09:23,230
I DON'T EVEN KNOW HIM!

208
00:09:23,313 --> 00:09:24,314
THEN WHY WERE YOU
WITH HIM?

209
00:09:24,398 --> 00:09:26,358
BECAUSE HE DIDN'T SAY NO!

210
00:09:28,527 --> 00:09:30,028
MAYA...
MAYA, THIS ISN'T YOU.

211
00:09:31,613 --> 00:09:33,156
I AM SO SICK OF PEOPLE
TELLING ME

212
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:35,534
WHO I'M SUPPOSED TO BE!

213
00:09:35,617 --> 00:09:37,786
EVEN THE MUSIC DIRECTOR
FOR THE YOUTH ORCHESTRA

214
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:39,162
WANTS ME TO EXPLAIN MYSELF

215
00:09:39,246 --> 00:09:40,664
OR HE WON'T GIVE ME
A SPOT, ZIG!

216
00:09:40,747 --> 00:09:43,166
SO JUST TELL THEM
ABOUT CAM.

217
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:46,545
PLAY THE "GIRLFRIEND OF
THE DEAD GUY" CARD, ZIG?

218
00:09:46,628 --> 00:09:48,797
I POSTED THAT VIDEO
BECAUSE I WANTED TO!

219
00:09:48,881 --> 00:09:50,465
MAYBE THIS IS ME NOW!

220
00:09:50,549 --> 00:09:52,217
IT'S NOT, MAYA!
YOU'RE JUST MAD!

221
00:09:54,428 --> 00:09:56,763
WHAT'RE YOU DOING?

222
00:09:56,847 --> 00:09:59,224
MAYA, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
YOUR PARENTS ARE GONNA FLIP!

223
00:09:59,308 --> 00:10:00,225
MAYA:
LET 'EM FLIP!
I DON'T CARE!

224
00:10:00,309 --> 00:10:01,810
I'M QUITTING!
AND I'M DONE!

225
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:07,065
(THUNDER RUMBLES,
RAIN PATTERS)

226
00:10:09,276 --> 00:10:11,195
DREW:
THAT'S VERY INTERESTING NEWS.

227
00:10:11,278 --> 00:10:13,238
OKAY, THANK YOU.

228
00:10:13,322 --> 00:10:13,780
BIANCA:
YOU DISAPPEARED
AFTER THE DEBATE.

229
00:10:13,864 --> 00:10:15,741
ARE YOU OKAY?

230
00:10:15,824 --> 00:10:16,575
DREW:
I'M GOOD.
I WAS A LITTLE BIT HUMILIATED,

231
00:10:16,658 --> 00:10:17,534
BUT IT DOESN'T MATTER
ANYMORE.

232
00:10:17,618 --> 00:10:19,036
I GOT OFF THE PHONE
WITH MY DOCTOR.

233
00:10:19,119 --> 00:10:20,787
AND?
HE CLEARED ME TO PLAY
NON-CONTACT SPORTS!

234
00:10:20,871 --> 00:10:22,581
(GASPS)
THAT'S AWESOME, BABE!
YEAH!

235
00:10:22,664 --> 00:10:24,249
SO I CAN DROP OUT
OF THE ELECTION,

236
00:10:24,333 --> 00:10:26,168
NOT MAKE A BIGGER FOOL
OF MYSELF.

237
00:10:26,251 --> 00:10:28,879
DROP OUT?
THE VOTE'S TODAY.

238
00:10:28,962 --> 00:10:30,255
YEAH, BUT IF I CAN
PLAY SPORTS,

239
00:10:30,339 --> 00:10:32,216
I DON'T NEED
STUDENT COUNCIL.

240
00:10:32,299 --> 00:10:33,884
DREW, YOU'RE NOT GONNA BE
A PRO ATHLETE,

241
00:10:33,967 --> 00:10:35,761
BUT THIS LEADERSHIP THING,
IT COULD TAKE YOU PLACES.

242
00:10:35,844 --> 00:10:38,138
PEOPLE DON'T TAKE ME SERIOUSLY,
ALL RIGHT?

243
00:10:38,222 --> 00:10:40,891
AND I DON'T...
I DON'T WANNA DISAPPOINT YOU.

244
00:10:40,974 --> 00:10:42,476
IMPOSSIBLE.

245
00:10:43,602 --> 00:10:44,186
AND THIS ISN'T ABOUT
WINNING,

246
00:10:44,269 --> 00:10:45,812
IT'S ABOUT TRYING.

247
00:10:45,896 --> 00:10:47,397
(BELL RINGS)

248
00:10:51,485 --> 00:10:52,986
HI, JENNA.

249
00:10:55,072 --> 00:10:56,949
ARE YOU STILL MAD AT ME?

250
00:10:57,032 --> 00:10:59,618
WELL, THAT DEPENDS.

251
00:10:59,701 --> 00:11:01,620
IS ONE OF THOSE LATTES
VANILLA?

252
00:11:01,703 --> 00:11:03,497
OF COURSE.
IT'S YOUR FAVOURITE.

253
00:11:07,209 --> 00:11:09,253
LOOK, JENNA,

254
00:11:09,336 --> 00:11:10,212
I DON'T WANT US
TO EVER GET INTO FIGHTS,

255
00:11:10,295 --> 00:11:11,797
OR GO ON BREAKS -
EVER.

256
00:11:14,716 --> 00:11:16,593
I LIKE YOU TOO MUCH
FOR THAT.

257
00:11:18,929 --> 00:11:20,430
I LIKE YOU TOO.

258
00:11:25,435 --> 00:11:27,479
SO WHO'S THE THIRD FOR?

259
00:11:27,563 --> 00:11:29,648
ALLI:

260
00:11:29,731 --> 00:11:31,108
GOT YOUR TEXT, CONNOR.
WHAT'S UP?

261
00:11:31,191 --> 00:11:32,526
CONNOR:
I GOT US COFFEES.

262
00:11:32,609 --> 00:11:34,486
WE'RE GONNA HAVE
A GOSSIP SESSION TOGETHER.

263
00:11:34,570 --> 00:11:36,071
OH! I EVEN GOT SOUR KEYS.

264
00:11:37,990 --> 00:11:41,285
BUT THERE'S NOTHING LEFT
FOR US TO GOSSIP ABOUT.

265
00:11:41,368 --> 00:11:41,910
ALLI:
SERIOUSLY, WE'VE EXHAUSTED
THE TOPIC OF CLARE AND ELI.

266
00:11:41,994 --> 00:11:44,079
IT'S OVER.

267
00:11:44,162 --> 00:11:45,622
CONNOR:
NO. I TALKED TO ELI.
THERE ARE FURTHER DEVELOPMENTS.

268
00:11:45,706 --> 00:11:47,332
ALLI:
GO ON.

269
00:11:47,416 --> 00:11:48,667
CONNOR:
WELL, HE SAYS THAT
HE MISSES CLARE

270
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:49,877
AND HE THINKS HE MADE
A HUGE MISTAKE.

271
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:52,254
YEAH, BUT IS HE JUST
SAYING THAT?

272
00:11:52,337 --> 00:11:54,256
CONNOR:
NO. HE WANTS TO KNOW
IF CLARE WOULD TAKE HIM BACK.

273
00:11:54,339 --> 00:11:55,549
ALLI:
WELL, TELL HIM TO TALK
TO HER, NOW!

274
00:11:55,632 --> 00:11:57,134
CONNOR:
BUT WILL SHE SAY YES?

275
00:11:57,217 --> 00:11:59,303

OF COURSE SHE WILL.
ARE YOU KIDDING?!

LAST CHANCE, PEOPLE!
MAKE SURE YOU GET OUT AND VOTE!

278
00:12:04,224 --> 00:12:05,726
TODAY'S THE DAY!

00:12:08,145 --> 00:12:09,646
MAYA:
HEY!

280
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:11,064
SO IT'S POSSIBLE
I'M A CRAZY GIRL.

281
00:12:11,148 --> 00:12:12,941
I DOUBT IT.

282
00:12:13,025 --> 00:12:15,694
WELL, I CHUCKED MY CELLO
IN A DUMPSTER.

283
00:12:15,777 --> 00:12:17,446
(LAUGHING) DUDE,
THAT'S SO PROPER!

284
00:12:19,865 --> 00:12:21,074
I JUST NEED SOMETHING NEW
IN MY LIFE RIGHT NOW,

285
00:12:21,158 --> 00:12:23,535
YOU KNOW?
I GET YOU.

286
00:12:23,619 --> 00:12:25,954
SO MY DAD'S WORKING LATE

SO DO YOU MAYBE WANNA
COME OVER

290
00:12:32,586 --> 00:12:35,130

OR SOMETHING?

291
00:12:35,214 --> 00:12:36,715
OR SOMETHING.

292
00:12:45,516 --> 00:12:47,017
SEE YOU TONIGHT.

293
00:12:53,232 --> 00:12:54,816
CONNOR:
MAYBE WE COULD GO TO THE DOT
AFTER SCHOOL?

294
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:56,026
THEY HAVE REALLY GOOD
CHICKEN NUGGETS.

295
00:12:56,109 --> 00:12:57,653
JENNA:
I LIKE THE DOT,
BUT SPACE IS FUN TOO-

296
00:12:57,736 --> 00:12:58,820
OH! TH-THERE'S ELI.
THERE'S ELI.

297
00:12:58,904 --> 00:13:01,198
ELI!

298
00:13:01,281 --> 00:13:02,574
I'VE GOT INTEL.
I TALKED TO ALLI

299
00:13:02,658 --> 00:13:03,617
AND SHE SAYS THAT
IF YOU TALK TO CLARE,

300
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:07,496
THERE'S A GOOD CHANCE
AT REUNIFICATION.

301
00:13:07,579 --> 00:13:08,622
WHY AREN'T YOU
MORE EXCITED?

302
00:13:08,705 --> 00:13:10,165
I THOUGHT THIS IS
WHAT YOU WANTED.

303
00:13:10,249 --> 00:13:12,501
I'VE JUST BEEN THINKING.

304
00:13:12,584 --> 00:13:14,753
MAYBE THIS BREAK'S
FOR THE BEST.

305
00:13:14,837 --> 00:13:15,963
I'M SO CONFUSED.

306
00:13:16,046 --> 00:13:17,631
WHY?

307
00:13:17,714 --> 00:13:19,383
DO YOU LIKE CLARE?
OF COURSE.

308
00:13:19,466 --> 00:13:20,884
DO YOU LOVE HER?
MORE THAN ANYONE.

309
00:13:20,968 --> 00:13:23,512
THEN WHY DON'T YOU WANNA
BE WITH HER?

310
00:13:28,433 --> 00:13:30,102
HOW'D THAT GO?

311
00:13:30,185 --> 00:13:32,521
I HAVE NO IDEA.

312
00:13:32,604 --> 00:13:35,482
ELI AND CLARE
ARE SO COMPLICATED.

313
00:13:35,566 --> 00:13:37,401
AND WE'RE SIMPLE?

314
00:13:37,484 --> 00:13:39,361
