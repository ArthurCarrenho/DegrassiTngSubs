1
00:00:04,421 --> 00:00:06,465
IMOGEN:
DO YOU THINK ELI
WILL LIKE IT?

2
00:00:06,548 --> 00:00:08,926
LOUIE MORENO:
I'M A LITTLE CONCERNED...

3
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:11,053
IT'S A BIT SMALL.

4
00:00:11,136 --> 00:00:13,055
OR DID ELI CAST
LITTY ITTY BITTY ACTORS?

5
00:00:15,224 --> 00:00:16,725
IMOGEN:
DAAA-AAAD!

6
00:00:19,061 --> 00:00:21,271
LOUIE MORENO:
YOUR ATTENTION TO DETAIL
ASTOUNDS ME, PRINCESS.

7
00:00:21,355 --> 00:00:22,606
YOU PUT YOUR SOUL
INTO THIS.

8
00:00:22,689 --> 00:00:24,149
I'M PROUD.

9
00:00:24,233 --> 00:00:25,192
IMOGEN:
HMM. COMING FROM THE GUY

10
00:00:25,275 --> 00:00:27,402
WHO STORES HIS CAR KEYS
IN THE CRISPER.

11
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:34,368
YOU WANT A TREAT?

12
00:00:34,451 --> 00:00:36,453
IMOGEN,
NO HUMAN FOOD FOR VOLTA.

13
00:00:36,537 --> 00:00:38,247
BUT WHY?
HE LIKES IT!

14
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:39,831
RIGHT, ANIMAL FRIEND?

15
00:00:42,125 --> 00:00:45,170
WHAT'S THIS,
SUSPENDED HERE?

16
00:00:45,254 --> 00:00:46,755
IT'S THE HEART,
UNITING THE HOUSES.

17
00:00:49,258 --> 00:00:52,219
IMAGINE IT ALL LIT UP.

18
00:00:52,302 --> 00:00:54,930
A SYMBOL OF ROMEO AND JULES'
EVERLASTING LOVE.

19
00:00:55,013 --> 00:00:56,890
EVEN WHEN THEIR STORY ENDS,

20
00:00:56,974 --> 00:00:58,851
THEIR HEARTS WILL SHINE
FOREVER.

21
00:00:58,934 --> 00:00:59,977
OVER HERE WILL GO
THE STAIRCASE.

22
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:01,812
STAGE RIGHT,
THE BALCONY.

23
00:01:01,895 --> 00:01:03,856
AND DOWNSTAGE CENTRE,
THE OPEN TOMB.

24
00:01:03,939 --> 00:01:05,858
WHERE THEY, YOU KNOW-

25
00:01:05,941 --> 00:01:07,442
(MAKES A KNIFE CUTTING SOUND)

26
00:01:09,444 --> 00:01:11,113
ELI:
I'M BLOWN AWAY.

27
00:01:11,196 --> 00:01:12,072
BUT HOW ARE WE SUPPOSED
TO BUILD IT IN TIME?

28
00:01:12,155 --> 00:01:13,657
IT'S AN INSANE AMOUNT
OF WORK.

29
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:15,784
AND I'M INSANE ABOUT
WORKING HARD.

30
00:01:15,868 --> 00:01:18,620
I CAN DO IT.
YOU JUST HAVE TO LET ME.

31
00:01:18,704 --> 00:01:20,122
HOW MUCH IS IT
GONNA COST?

32
00:01:20,205 --> 00:01:22,666
USING RECYCLED MATERIALS
AND SCRAPS?

33
00:01:22,749 --> 00:01:24,251
ABOUT FI...
FIVE...

34
00:01:25,794 --> 00:01:27,171
IMOGEN.
FIVE HUNDRED!

35
00:01:27,254 --> 00:01:29,631
WOW, LOOK,
I WANT THIS SET,

36
00:01:29,715 --> 00:01:32,634
BUT WITH RIGHTS,
COSTUMES, LIGHTS -

37
00:01:32,718 --> 00:01:35,179
SCALE IT BACK.

38
00:01:35,262 --> 00:01:37,639
UNLESS YOU KNOW SOME BIG
SHOT WHO CAN SPONSOR US.

39
00:01:41,602 --> 00:01:43,228
THERE IS SOMEONE.

OKAY, YEAH, I KNOW,
I AM TONE DEAF.

65
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:49,920
MAYA'S TOLD ME ONCE
OR TWICE.

00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:51,839
JAKE:
HERE. KATIE,
I WANNA SHOW YOU SOMETHING.

67
00:02:55,634 --> 00:02:57,511
I DID THAT.

68
00:02:57,594 --> 00:02:58,512
I PLANTED A SEED
IN THE GROUND,

69
00:02:58,595 --> 00:03:00,472
AND NOW IT'S ALIVE.

70
00:03:00,556 --> 00:03:02,766
YEAH, PRETTY CUTE LITTLE
DIANTHUS, HUH?

71
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:05,102
YOU KNOW, I NEVER THOUGHT
I'D GET SO MUCH SATISFACTION

72
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:07,855
FROM TAKING CARE OF SOMETHING
AND WATCHING IT GROW.

73
00:03:07,938 --> 00:03:09,189
BEATS WIPING DOWN
COMPUTERS.

74
00:03:09,273 --> 00:03:11,775
UGH, BUT SERIOUSLY.

75
00:03:11,859 --> 00:03:12,818
YOU KNOW, I WAS IN SUCH
A WEIRD PLACE

76
00:03:12,901 --> 00:03:15,112
AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS YEAR.

77
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:17,447
THIS GARDEN HAS REALLY
HELPED ME.

78
00:03:17,531 --> 00:03:19,658
I MEAN, I FEEL RELAXED,
INDEPENDENT,

79
00:03:19,741 --> 00:03:20,784
FREE OF EXPECTATIONS.

80
00:03:20,868 --> 00:03:22,369
THANK YOU.

81
00:03:24,496 --> 00:03:25,622
HEY, YOU'RE THE ONE WHO
INSPIRED THE WHOLE THING,

82
00:03:25,706 --> 00:03:27,207
SO... THANK YOURSELF.

83
00:03:42,598 --> 00:03:45,142
OKAY.
HERE'S THE PLAN:

84
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:46,476
GO IN. GET THE MONEY.
GET OUT.

85
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,061
STOP BLINKING!

86
00:03:48,145 --> 00:03:50,397
IMOGEN:
YOUR FINGER IS IN MY EYE.

87
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,356
FIONA:
WELL, CAN'T YOU JUST
WEAR YOUR GLASSES?

88
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,774
WHY THE TORTURE?

89
00:03:52,858 --> 00:03:54,568
DAD WEARS GLASSES,

90
00:03:54,651 --> 00:03:56,278
AND NATALIE LEFT DAD,
AND IF I WEAR MY GLASSES,

91
00:03:56,361 --> 00:03:57,404
SHE'LL THINK OF HIM
AND NOT GIVE ME THE MONEY

92
00:03:57,487 --> 00:03:59,531
I NEED TO MAKE MY DREAMS
COME TRUE.

93
00:03:59,615 --> 00:04:00,616
OKAY. AND I THOUGHT MY
MOTHER-DAUGHTER RELATIONSHIP

94
00:04:00,699 --> 00:04:01,617
WAS COMPLICATED.

95
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:03,202
NATALIE'S EVIL.

96
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:06,747
SHE LEFT WHEN I WAS EIGHT.

97
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:08,081
AND ALL SHE CARED ABOUT WAS
CUTTING INTO PEOPLE'S BACKS.

98
00:04:08,165 --> 00:04:09,875
SHE'S A BACK STABBER?

99
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:12,127
SPINAL SURGEON.
WITH A PERFECT NEW FAMILY.

100
00:04:12,211 --> 00:04:14,004
I SEE HER ONCE A MONTH,

101
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:15,297
ONLY WHEN I CAN'T FIND
AN EXCUSE TO GET OUT OF IT.

102
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:16,882
I HATE IT THERE.

103
00:04:18,175 --> 00:04:20,093
SO ARE YOU SURE
YOU WANNA DO THIS?

104
00:04:20,177 --> 00:04:21,345
FIONES! YOU KNOW HOW MUCH
I LOVED TO BUILD

105
00:04:21,428 --> 00:04:23,514
THAT MINI HOUSE LAST YEAR.

106
00:04:23,597 --> 00:04:25,265
THIS IS MY CHANCE TO BUILD
SOMETHING FULL SCALE,

107
00:04:25,349 --> 00:04:26,725
FROM THE GROUND UP.

108
00:04:26,808 --> 00:04:28,435
WELL, IN THAT CASE,

109
00:04:28,519 --> 00:04:29,895
GO GET THAT MONEY
FROM YOUR EVIL MOM.

110
00:04:29,978 --> 00:04:31,980
YOU DESERVE IT.

111
00:04:32,064 --> 00:04:33,440
PA:
GREEN FACT OF THE TODAY...

112
00:04:33,524 --> 00:04:35,067
DISPOSAL COFFEE CUPS
ARE RECYCLABLE.

113
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:37,194
NOW YOU KNOW.

114
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:38,779
JUST IN TIME!
THESE ARE PERFECT.

115
00:04:40,447 --> 00:04:41,740
MOST GIRLS GOING
TO A NEW SCHOOL

116
00:04:41,823 --> 00:04:43,575
FOCUS ON GETTING A BOYFRIEND.

117
00:04:43,659 --> 00:04:45,118
YOU'VE RAISED MONEY
FOR HURRICANE RELIEF.

118
00:04:45,202 --> 00:04:46,870
I REALLY ADMIRE YOU,
BECKY.

119
00:04:46,954 --> 00:04:48,288
CONNOR:
EXCUSE ME,
IS THIS WERE I GET TICKETS

120
00:04:48,372 --> 00:04:49,873
FOR ROMEO AND JULES:
A MUSICAL EXPERIENCE?

121
00:04:49,957 --> 00:04:51,375
ADAM:
YEP. RIGHT HERE!

122
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:53,210
BECKY:
UM, EXCUSE ME, BOYS.

123
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:55,254
CAN YOU CONDUCT YOUR
BUSINESS ELSEWHERE?

124
00:04:55,337 --> 00:04:57,506
I BOOKED THE FOYER TABLE
FOR THE WEEK.

125
00:04:57,589 --> 00:04:58,549
SO IF YOU DON'T MIND-

126
00:04:58,632 --> 00:04:59,842
OHHHH, OKAY.

127
00:04:59,925 --> 00:05:01,468
I SEE WHAT'S GOING ON HERE.

128
00:05:01,552 --> 00:05:02,344
YOU THINK BECAUSE
I'M THE NEW GIRL,

129
00:05:02,427 --> 00:05:03,595
YOU GET TO PUSH ME AROUND.

130
00:05:03,679 --> 00:05:05,180
NO WAY.
EARLY BIRD GETS THE WORM.

131
00:05:05,264 --> 00:05:07,140
SO IF YOU DON'T MIND-

132
00:05:07,224 --> 00:05:10,060
JENNA:
ACTUALLY,
ADAM'S NOT LYING.

133
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:10,894
YOU HAVE TO SIGN THE TABLE
OUT WITH THE OFFICE.

134
00:05:10,978 --> 00:05:12,479
I SHOULD HAVE TOLD YOU.

135
00:05:14,731 --> 00:05:16,900
NO, IT'S OKAY.
I DON'T BLAME YOU, JENNA.

136
00:05:16,984 --> 00:05:18,485
IT'S JUST THAT MUSICAL...

137
00:05:20,904 --> 00:05:22,406
RIGHT OVER THERE.
OKAY.

138
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:29,288
THIS IS A NICE SURPRISE.

139
00:05:29,371 --> 00:05:30,080
SORRY I HAVEN'T BEEN
RETURNING YOUR CALLS LATELY.

140
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:32,416
SCHOOL'S BEEN CRAY CRAY.

141
00:05:32,499 --> 00:05:32,958
OH, YOU'RE WEARING
YOUR CONTACTS.

142
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:34,877
YOU LOOK GREAT.

143
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:37,838
OF COURSE THAT'S
WHAT YOU THINK.

144
00:05:37,921 --> 00:05:39,214
I HAVE AN HOUR FOR LUNCH.

145
00:05:39,298 --> 00:05:39,965
HOW DOES A VENDING MACHINE
SANDWICH SOUND?

146
00:05:40,048 --> 00:05:41,049
IMOGEN:
UH, ACTUALLY-

147
00:05:41,133 --> 00:05:42,426
YOU CAME FOR LUNCH,
DIDN'T YOU?

148
00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:43,093
I WANT TO HEAR
HOW YOU'RE DOING.

149
00:05:43,177 --> 00:05:46,388
HOW YOUR FATHER'S DOING.

150
00:05:46,471 --> 00:05:47,639
I CAN STAY FOR A QUICK NIBBLE,
I SUPPOSE.

151
00:05:47,723 --> 00:05:49,600
CHICKEN SALAD OR TUNA?

152
00:05:49,683 --> 00:05:51,518
YOU KNOW WHAT,
I'LL GET ONE OF EACH.

153
00:05:51,602 --> 00:05:53,103
SUPER.

154
00:06:03,906 --> 00:06:05,407
(EXHALES)

155
00:06:10,579 --> 00:06:12,080
WHAT'S UP?

156
00:06:13,457 --> 00:06:16,585
EVERYWHERE I GO "IT'S MUSICAL
THIS, MUSICAL THAT".

157
00:06:16,668 --> 00:06:18,462
THERE IS SOMETHING
WRONG WITH THIS SCHOOL.

158
00:06:18,545 --> 00:06:20,214
HERE WE GO AGAIN.

159
00:06:20,297 --> 00:06:22,591
PEOPLE ARE IN NEED,
LUKE.

160
00:06:22,674 --> 00:06:25,010
AND INSTEAD OF HELPING,
THEY'RE PUTTING ON A MUSICAL.

161
00:06:25,093 --> 00:06:26,595
OH, NO,
NOT A MUSICAL.

162
00:06:29,556 --> 00:06:30,974
THE BLASPHEMOUS MUSICAL
THAT NORMALIZES

163
00:06:31,058 --> 00:06:32,809
ALTERNATIVE LIFESTYLES,
REMEMBER?

164
00:06:32,893 --> 00:06:33,477
LOOK,
JUST IGNORE IT.

165
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,062
I CAN'T!

166
00:06:35,604 --> 00:06:37,523
IT'S WRONG.

167
00:06:37,606 --> 00:06:38,899
BECKS, ARE YOU
FORGETTING ABOUT

168
00:06:38,982 --> 00:06:41,818
YOUR SUPER-ANNOYING
SUPERPOWER?

169
00:06:41,902 --> 00:06:43,403
YOU'RE LOUD.
JUST MAKE 'EM LISTEN.

170
00:06:54,081 --> 00:06:55,916
YOU GET THAT FROM YOUR DAD.

171
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:57,918
IMOGEN:
I GET A LOT
OF THINGS FROM HIM.

172
00:06:58,001 --> 00:06:59,253
YOU SHOULD TRY EATING
THE CRUST.

173
00:06:59,336 --> 00:07:00,045
BELIEVE IT OR NOT,
IT'S MY FAVOURITE PART.

174
00:07:00,128 --> 00:07:01,630
HM, I'M OKAY.

175
00:07:04,091 --> 00:07:05,050
HOW HAS YOUR DAD BEEN?

176
00:07:05,133 --> 00:07:06,635
GREAT.

177
00:07:07,219 --> 00:07:08,720
ANYTHING UNUSUAL?

178
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:12,140
SAME OLD.

179
00:07:13,892 --> 00:07:15,185
IS HE REMEMBERING TO MAKE
YOU BREAKFAST?

180
00:07:15,269 --> 00:07:17,354
I'M SEVENTEEN.
I MAKE MY OWN BREAKFAST.

181
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:18,939
RIGHT.

182
00:07:20,983 --> 00:07:22,276
IF YOU NEED
A HOUSEKEEPER-

183
00:07:22,359 --> 00:07:25,362
DAD'S TAKEN CARE OF ME
ALL MY LIFE.

184
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:27,322
I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU CARE
ALL OF A SUDDEN.

185
00:07:27,406 --> 00:07:27,823
I KNOW IT'S HARD FOR YOU
TO BELIEVE,

186
00:07:27,906 --> 00:07:29,408
BUT I DO CARE.

187
00:07:31,243 --> 00:07:34,246
IF THERE'S EVER ANYTHING,
YOU CAN CALL ME.

188
00:07:34,329 --> 00:07:37,082
I'M BUILDING SETS
FOR THE SCHOOL MUSICAL.

189
00:07:37,165 --> 00:07:39,209
THE THING IS,
THERE'S ZERO BUDGET

190
00:07:39,293 --> 00:07:41,211
SO THEY CAN'T USE
ANY OF MY DESIGNS.

191
00:07:45,757 --> 00:07:46,633
HOW MUCH DO YOU NEED?

192
00:07:46,717 --> 00:07:48,260
FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS.

193
00:07:58,979 --> 00:08:01,398
ONE CONDITION.

194
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:03,442
YOU COME OVER FOR DINNER
TOMORROW NIGHT.

195
00:08:03,525 --> 00:08:04,693
THERE'S SOMETHING IMPORTANT
WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT.

196
00:08:04,776 --> 00:08:06,195
I WOULD LOVE TO STAY

197
00:08:06,278 --> 00:08:07,529
AND CHAT A LITTLE BIT LONGER,
NATALIE,

198
00:08:07,613 --> 00:08:09,573
BUT I NEED TO GET BACK
TO SCHOOL.

199
00:08:09,656 --> 00:08:11,283
RIGHT.

200
00:08:11,366 --> 00:08:12,868
IMOGEN?

201
00:08:14,786 --> 00:08:16,455
THE NEXT TIME YOU
COME TO VISIT,

202
00:08:16,538 --> 00:08:19,166
IT WOULD BE NICE IF IT WASN'T
BECAUSE YOU NEEDED MONEY.

203
00:08:27,508 --> 00:08:28,675
MARISOL:
YOU'RE IN LOVE
WITH JAKE?!

204
00:08:28,759 --> 00:08:30,344
YEAH. LOUDER.
PLEASE.

205
00:08:30,427 --> 00:08:31,637
THIS IS PERFECT!

206
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,305
JAKE IS FRIENDS WITH MO.

207
00:08:33,388 --> 00:08:35,265
DOUBLE-DATESIES!

208
00:08:35,349 --> 00:08:37,643
NO, MARE,
I'M NOT HAPPY ABOUT THIS.

209
00:08:37,726 --> 00:08:40,103
HE HASN'T MADE A MOVE,
HE DOESN'T EVEN LIKE ME.

210
00:08:40,187 --> 00:08:41,605
I'M JUST HIS
LANDSCAPING BUDDY.

211
00:08:41,688 --> 00:08:42,898
YOU DON'T KNOW THAT.

212
00:08:42,981 --> 00:08:44,441
TRUST ME.

213
00:08:44,525 --> 00:08:46,151
EVEN IF HE DID LIKE ME,

214
00:08:46,235 --> 00:08:48,070
BEST CASE SCENARIO:
WE DATE,

215
00:08:48,153 --> 00:08:51,031
WE FALL IN LOVE,
HE CHEATS,

216
00:08:51,114 --> 00:08:53,116
WE BREAK UP, AND THEN HATE EACH
OTHER FOREVER.

217
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,284
A PERFECTLY GOOD FRIENDSHIP
COMPLETELY RUINED.

218
00:08:54,368 --> 00:08:55,619
GLASS HALF EMPTY MUCH?

219
00:08:55,702 --> 00:08:57,204
(BELL RINGS)

220
00:09:02,459 --> 00:09:06,171
I TRUST YOU HAVE ALL
METICULOUSLY READ CHAPTER 7?

221
00:09:06,255 --> 00:09:09,132
PARTNER UP FOR YOUR PROJECTS,
YOUNG PHYSICISTS!

222
00:09:09,216 --> 00:09:11,718
SINCE I'M WORKING WITH MO,
PARTNER UP WITH JAKE.

223
00:09:11,802 --> 00:09:14,096
SEE WHERE IT GOES.

224
00:09:14,179 --> 00:09:17,224
I KNOW WHERE IT'S GONNA GO,
AND I DON'T WANNA GO THERE.

225
00:09:17,307 --> 00:09:19,643
WHICH IS WHY I'M GONNA
PAIR UP WITH SOMEONE

226
00:09:19,726 --> 00:09:21,228
I COULD NEVER FALL FOR.

227
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:27,150
THE GIRL WITH
THE DRAGON TATTOO.

228
00:09:27,234 --> 00:09:29,236
TO WHAT DO I OWE
THIS PLEASURE?

229
00:09:29,319 --> 00:09:30,279
I WAS GOING TO SUGGEST
WE WORK TOGETHER.

230
00:09:30,362 --> 00:09:32,447
ARE YOU GONNA BE AN ASS
ABOUT IT?

231
00:09:32,531 --> 00:09:35,659
ARE YOU GONNA SABOTAGE ME LIKE
YOU DID AT THE PEP RALLY?

232
00:09:35,742 --> 00:09:37,619
NO. I'LL BE GOOD.
PROMISE.

233
00:09:40,122 --> 00:09:43,000
OKAY. ON THREE.
ONE, TWO, THREE.

234
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:44,585
SLOW...

235
00:09:48,964 --> 00:09:51,675
♪ So this is what you meant ♪

236
00:09:51,758 --> 00:09:53,969
♪ When said that
you're a friend ♪

237
00:09:54,052 --> 00:09:55,470
EEE! THANKS. OKAY.

238
00:09:55,554 --> 00:09:57,472
EVERYONE TAKE TEN,

239
00:09:57,556 --> 00:09:59,224
AND WE'LL FINISH
THE CAPULET HOUSE AFTER.

240
00:10:00,934 --> 00:10:02,436
TRES IMPRESSIONNANT.

241
00:10:04,897 --> 00:10:06,565
SO, YOU DEFEATED
THE EVIL QUEEN

242
00:10:06,648 --> 00:10:07,816
AND GOT YOUR MATERIALS,
I SEE?

243
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:09,568
(SIGHS)
AT A COST.

244
00:10:09,651 --> 00:10:10,861
SHE WANTS TO EAT DINNER
WITH ME TONIGHT.

245
00:10:10,944 --> 00:10:12,821
I RATHER DIE
A THOUSAND DEATHS.

246
00:10:12,905 --> 00:10:14,531
OH, QUELLE DRAME.

247
00:10:14,615 --> 00:10:15,824
MO:
THERE'S A CRAZY GUY OUTSIDE.

248
00:10:15,908 --> 00:10:17,117
MARISOL:
WEARING A ROBE.

249
00:10:17,201 --> 00:10:19,244
FLASHER ON THE LOOSE!

250
00:10:19,328 --> 00:10:22,080
AN EX-BOYFRIEND FROM YOUR
HETERO DAYS, PEUT-ETRE?

251
00:10:22,164 --> 00:10:24,208
FUNNY.
I'VE GOTTA SEE THIS.

252
00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:33,592
WHAT'S WRONG?

253
00:10:33,675 --> 00:10:35,177
HAVE YOU MET MY DAD?

254
00:10:47,272 --> 00:10:49,983
IT'S WEIRD.

255
00:10:50,067 --> 00:10:51,777
SEE, THIS IS WHY I DON'T INVITE
YOU OVER TO MY HOUSE.

256
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:54,154
BECAUSE I KNEW
YOU GET ALL JUDGE-Y

257
00:10:54,238 --> 00:10:55,739
I MEAN,
I KNOW IT'S WEIRD.

258
00:10:55,822 --> 00:10:57,491
BUT IT'S NOT WEIRD
FOR MY DAD.

259
00:10:58,659 --> 00:11:03,372
SO HE'S WORN A ROBE IN PUBLIC
TO VISIT YOU AT SCHOOL BEFORE.

260
00:11:03,455 --> 00:11:07,501
NO. BUT SOMETIMES WE GO
FOR BRUNCH IN OUR ROBES.

261
00:11:07,584 --> 00:11:09,920
AND HE ALWAYS WALKS VOLTA
IN HIS PAJAMAS.

262
00:11:10,003 --> 00:11:11,463
LIKE SWEATPANTS AND UGGS?

263
00:11:11,547 --> 00:11:13,841
OR HE FORGETS TO GET DRESSED?

264
00:11:13,924 --> 00:11:16,051
OKAY.

265
00:11:16,134 --> 00:11:18,637
I'LL ADMIT IT HE HAS BEEN
FORGETFUL LATELY.

266
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,055
WALKING INTO ROOMS
AND FORGETS WHY HE'S THERE.

267
00:11:20,138 --> 00:11:22,641
KEYS IN THE FRIDGE
ON A REGULAR.

268
00:11:22,724 --> 00:11:25,352
BUT WHO DOESN'T THAT HAPPEN TO,
RIGHT?

269
00:11:25,435 --> 00:11:27,813
AND HE'S BEEN REALLY, REALLY
BUSY WITH A NEW COURSE.

270
00:11:32,317 --> 00:11:33,318
I THINK IT'S TIME FOR YOU
TO SEE US MORENOS IN ACTION

271
00:11:33,402 --> 00:11:35,237
TO FULLY UNDERSTAND.

272
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:37,281
COME OVER TONIGHT.

273
00:11:37,364 --> 00:11:38,866
I'LL MAKE QUESADILLAS!

274
00:11:40,868 --> 00:11:42,786
AND WHAT ABOUT DINNER
WITH YOUR MOM?

275
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:45,914
IT'S NOT LIKE SHE HASN'T
LET ME DOWN BEFORE.

276
00:11:45,998 --> 00:11:48,667
HOW CAN I RESIST
QUESADILLAS?

277
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:50,252
BOTH:
ARRRRRRRRIBA!

278
00:11:52,796 --> 00:11:55,716
PA:
JUNIOR PHYSICIST YOUR MONEY
FOR PROGRAMMING IN NOW OVERDUE.

279
00:11:55,799 --> 00:11:58,427
NO CASH, NO TOUR.

280
00:11:58,510 --> 00:12:00,470
ADAM:
TICKETS FOR ROMEO AND JULES:
A MUSICAL EXPERIENCE

281
00:12:00,554 --> 00:12:01,889
ARE NOW ON SALE IN THE FOYER.

282
00:12:01,972 --> 00:12:04,808
AGH,
I KNEW I'D REGRET THIS.

283
00:12:04,892 --> 00:12:07,352
AREN'T WE SUPPOSED TO BE
WORKING ON OUR ASSIGNMENT?

284
00:12:07,436 --> 00:12:09,021
DALLAS:
WELCOME TO PHYSICS
WITH DALLAS.

285
00:12:09,104 --> 00:12:10,606
MINI PUTT?

286
00:12:12,107 --> 00:12:14,109
DALLAS:
NEWTON'S SECOND LAW,
GOLF STYLE.

287
00:12:14,193 --> 00:12:15,944
HOMEWORK IS WAY BETTER
WHEN IT'S ABOUT SPORTS.

288
00:12:16,028 --> 00:12:17,029
NOT THAT YOU PLAY
ANYTHING.

289
00:12:17,112 --> 00:12:19,281
EXCUSE ME?

290
00:12:19,364 --> 00:12:22,618
YOU'RE LOOKING AT A NATIONAL
SOCCER TEAM HOPEFUL.

291
00:12:22,701 --> 00:12:25,454
WELL, THAT IS,
BEFORE I TORE MY ACL.

292
00:12:25,537 --> 00:12:26,622
YEAH, MY HOCKEY DOOR'S
CLOSING, TOO.

293
00:12:26,705 --> 00:12:28,957
INJURY?

294
00:12:29,041 --> 00:12:31,001
THAT WOULD BE EASIER
ON THE EGO.

295
00:12:31,084 --> 00:12:32,878
I'M JUST NOT NHL MATERIAL.

296
00:12:32,961 --> 00:12:34,421
WELL, YOU NEVER KNOW,
YOU COULD STILL GET DRAFTED.

297
00:12:34,505 --> 00:12:35,339
YEAH, BUT I KNOW
WHAT I'M UP AGAINST.

298
00:12:35,422 --> 00:12:36,548
AND I'VE DEALT WITH IT.

299
00:12:36,632 --> 00:12:38,217
THAT'S WHY
I'VE TAKEN UP GOLF.

300
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:40,177
LAUGH IT UP,
DRAGON TATTOO.

301
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:41,345
BUT IT ACTUALLY REQUIRES
SKILL AND IT'S HIGH PRESSURE.

302
00:12:41,428 --> 00:12:43,680
THAT'S HOW I THRIVE.

303
00:12:43,764 --> 00:12:45,516
YOU SOUND LIKE
LAST YEAR KATIE.

304
00:12:45,599 --> 00:12:47,601
SO WHAT'S THIS YEAR
KATIE ABOUT?

305
00:12:47,684 --> 00:12:49,394
HOOKING UP
WITH THAT GARDEN BOY?

306
00:12:49,478 --> 00:12:50,729
HIS NAME IS JAKE.

307
00:12:50,812 --> 00:12:53,440
AND NO,
WE'RE NOT HOOKING UP.

308
00:12:53,524 --> 00:12:56,652
I'M ON A RELATIONSHIP
HIATUS SINCE DREW.

309
00:12:56,735 --> 00:12:57,778
YOU KNOW HE MOVED OUT
OF THE HOUSE?

310
00:12:57,861 --> 00:13:00,072
YEAH, INTO FIONA'S LOFT,
I HEARD.

311
00:13:00,155 --> 00:13:01,740
THAT'S A SITCOM
WAITING TO HAPPEN.

312
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:03,325
I THINK IT'S ALREADY IS.

313
00:13:08,330 --> 00:13:10,207
WHY DON'T YOU HIT SOME BALLS
WITH ME AFTER SCHOOL?

314
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:12,209
UH, LET'S JUST FOCUS
ON OUR ASSIGNMENT, OKAY?

315
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:18,048
BECKY:
♪ LOOK INTO A CHILD'S EYES, ♪

316
00:13:18,131 --> 00:13:20,926

317
00:13:21,885 --> 00:13:25,973
♪ LOOK INTO A CHILD'S EYES ♪

318
00:13:28,976 --> 00:13:30,477
(APPLAUSE)

319
00:13:33,146 --> 00:13:34,731
THANK YOU SO MUCH!

320
00:13:34,815 --> 00:13:36,316
EVERY BIT HELPS.

321
00:13:37,234 --> 00:13:39,361
ROMEO AND JULES TICKETS,

322
00:13:41,154 --> 00:13:42,948

TEN DOLLARS

323
00:13:43,031 --> 00:13:44,700
CAN PROVIDE A MEAL
FOR A FAMILY OF FIVE INSTEAD.

324
00:13:44,783 --> 00:13:46,285
THINK ABOUT IT.

325
00:13:56,587 --> 00:13:58,547
THAT WAS VERY GENEROUS
OF YOU.

326
00:13:58,630 --> 00:14:00,549
THAT'S ME,
MR. GENEROSITY.

327
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:04,052
WOULD YOU MIND
TONING IT DOWN?

328
00:14:04,136 --> 00:14:05,679
IN THIS ECONOMIC DOWNTURN,

329
00:14:05,762 --> 00:14:08,265
THERE'S ONLY SO MUCH
MONEY TO GO AROUND.

330
00:14:08,348 --> 00:14:11,518
AND ELI DESERVES
NONE OF IT.

331
00:14:11,602 --> 00:14:14,396
HE'S FINALLY GETTING
WHAT HE DESERVES.

332
00:14:14,479 --> 00:14:15,314
DON'T YOU MEAN YOU'RE HAPPY
TO BE RAISING MONEY

333
00:14:15,397 --> 00:14:16,899
FOR YOUR CAUSE?

334
00:14:19,401 --> 00:14:21,653
YOU'RE USING CHARITY
FOR REVENGE.

335
00:14:23,989 --> 00:14:25,657
WHAT IF I AM?

336
00:14:25,741 --> 00:14:27,868
THAT'S LOW,
BECKY BAKER.

337
00:14:27,951 --> 00:14:30,245
I DIDN'T THINK YOU
WERE A HYPOCRITE.

338
00:14:30,329 --> 00:14:31,830
(SCOFFS)

339
00:14:33,832 --> 00:14:35,334
(BELL RINGS)

340
00:14:38,837 --> 00:14:41,215
FUTURE BOYFRIEND

MARISOL:

343
00:14:44,885 --> 00:14:46,178
JAKE:
I GOT TWO TICKETS
TO THE GARDEN SHOW.

344
00:14:46,261 --> 00:14:49,890
THOUGHT WE COULD PICK UP SOME
SUSTAINABLE FERTILIZER?

345
00:14:49,973 --> 00:14:52,935
I'D LIKE TO,
BUT I HAVE HOMEWORK.

346
00:14:53,018 --> 00:14:55,562
NEXT TIME.

347
00:14:55,646 --> 00:14:56,688
MARISOL'S MAKING FACES
BEHIND ME, ISN'T SHE?

348
00:14:56,772 --> 00:14:58,398
YEAH.
YEAH.

349
00:14:58,482 --> 00:14:59,983
HI.

350
00:15:02,236 --> 00:15:04,029
WHAT'S WRONG?
HE ASKED YOU OUT!

351
00:15:04,112 --> 00:15:06,532
NO, HE ASKED ME
TO GO BUY MANURE.

352
00:15:06,615 --> 00:15:08,033
IT SOUNDED LIKE
A DATE TO ME.

353
00:15:08,116 --> 00:15:09,701
BESIDES, I'M GOLFING
WITH DALLAS.

354
00:15:09,785 --> 00:15:11,161
OKAY, HOLD UP.

355
00:15:11,245 --> 00:15:13,705
YOU'RE GIVING MIKE DALLAS
A SHOT, BUT NOT JAKE?

356
00:15:13,789 --> 00:15:16,458
I'M NOT GIVING ANYONE
ANY SHOTS.

357
00:15:16,542 --> 00:15:18,836
AFTER I LOST SOCCER, DREW,
AND STUDENT COUNCIL -

358
00:15:18,919 --> 00:15:21,421
I WAS FLAILING SO...

359
00:15:21,505 --> 00:15:22,965
BUT THE GARDEN HELPED YOU!

360
00:15:23,048 --> 00:15:24,800
YEAH. FOR A WHILE.

361
00:15:24,883 --> 00:15:26,385
BUT NOW THAT
THAT'S COMPLICATED

362
00:15:26,468 --> 00:15:28,345
BECAUSE JAKE ONLY WANTS
TO BUY FECES WITH ME,

363
00:15:28,428 --> 00:15:30,430
SO I NEED A NEW THING.

364
00:15:30,514 --> 00:15:33,058
BUT GOLF, REALLY?!

365
00:15:33,141 --> 00:15:34,643
WELL,
IT'S BETTER THAN CRAP.

366
00:15:46,321 --> 00:15:48,282
SORRY I'M LATE!

367
00:15:48,365 --> 00:15:52,160
OUR GROCER HAS A VENDETTA
AGAINST FERMENTED BUTTERFAT.

368
00:15:52,244 --> 00:15:54,955
HE MEANS THEY'RE
OUT OF SOUR CREAM.

369
00:15:55,038 --> 00:15:58,667
AND HOW ARE MY GREEN
PEPPERS COMING ALONG?

370
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:00,586
FIONA:
ARE THESE CHOPPED
FINELY ENOUGH?

371
00:16:00,669 --> 00:16:02,171
I'LL DO ANOTHER PASS.

372
00:16:04,047 --> 00:16:06,842
FIONA:
SORRY, COOKING WAS NEVER REALLY
A COYNE FAMILY ACTIVITY.

373
00:16:06,925 --> 00:16:09,178
MY DAD LIKES THEM
IMPOSSIBLY SMALL.

374
00:16:09,261 --> 00:16:11,430
WHY DON'T YOU GRATE
SOME CHEDDAR!

375
00:16:13,765 --> 00:16:15,434
LOUIE AND IMOGEN:
♪ WE'VE GOT ISSUES ♪

376
00:16:15,517 --> 00:16:17,060
♪ BURLINGTON COMICS! ♪

377
00:16:17,144 --> 00:16:18,562
(LAUGHING)

378
00:16:18,645 --> 00:16:19,980
FIONA:
AMAZING.

379
00:16:20,063 --> 00:16:20,981
AS A KIDS,
DECLAN AND I,

380
00:16:21,064 --> 00:16:21,773
WEREN'T ALLOWED TO SING
COMMERCIALS.

381
00:16:21,857 --> 00:16:23,025
WHY NOT?

382
00:16:23,108 --> 00:16:24,985
SOMETHING STUPID.

383
00:16:25,068 --> 00:16:27,321
MY MOM SAW IT
AS LOW BROW AND SILLY.

384
00:16:27,404 --> 00:16:29,781
LOUIE MORENO:
I'M AFRAID YOUR MOTHER
HAS A POINT THERE.

385
00:16:34,244 --> 00:16:36,246
HEY! DO I HAVE SOMETHING
ON MY FACE?

386
00:16:37,581 --> 00:16:40,042
IMOGEN,
NO PLAYING WITH FOOD.

387
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:44,254
DON'T WORRY, VOLTA THE CANINE
VACUUM WILL GET IT.

388
00:16:44,338 --> 00:16:46,298
FIONA:
I SHOULD GET MY SELF
ONE IF THOSE.

389
00:16:46,381 --> 00:16:47,883
THEN AGAIN, I HAVE DREW.

390
00:16:49,968 --> 00:16:51,470
HEY DAD, WHERE'S VOLTA?

391
00:16:53,722 --> 00:16:56,433
I... I PUT HIM OUT
IN THE YARD.

392
00:16:56,517 --> 00:16:57,935
ALL DAY?

393
00:16:58,018 --> 00:16:59,770
UGH, I'LL GET HIM.

394
00:16:59,853 --> 00:17:01,605
LOUIE MORENO:
TAKE HIM FOR A QUICK WALK
WHILE YOU'RE OUT THERE?

395
00:17:01,688 --> 00:17:03,315
LET'S GO, FIONES!

396
00:17:08,445 --> 00:17:09,947
IMOGEN:
VOLTA?

397
00:17:11,532 --> 00:17:11,949
FIONA:
I TAKE BACK WHAT I SAID
ABOUT YOUR DAD.

398
00:17:12,032 --> 00:17:13,867
HE'S AWESOME.

399
00:17:13,951 --> 00:17:14,868
HE KIND OF MAKES
MAKES ME MISS MY MOM.

400
00:17:14,952 --> 00:17:17,371
STUPID HOUSE ARREST.

401
00:17:17,454 --> 00:17:18,747
TOO BAD HE LOSES DOGS
THOUGH.

402
00:17:18,830 --> 00:17:20,290
HEY, IT HAPPENS.

403
00:17:20,374 --> 00:17:23,001
I SET A CAT FREE
ON PURPOSE ONCE.

404
00:17:23,085 --> 00:17:24,586
GO GRAB THE CAR KEYS
FROM MY DAD.

405
00:17:24,670 --> 00:17:27,047
WE'LL TAKE A DRIVE AROUND
THE NEIGHBORHOOD TO FIND HIM.

406
00:17:29,466 --> 00:17:30,968
WHERE ARE YOU,
ANIMAL FRIEND?

407
00:17:42,271 --> 00:17:43,772
(EMOTIONAL BREATHS)

408
00:17:45,649 --> 00:17:47,150
(CRYING)

409
00:17:49,403 --> 00:17:51,572
FIONA:
IMOGEN,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

410
00:17:51,655 --> 00:17:52,614
(SOBBING)

411
00:17:52,698 --> 00:17:54,199
WHAT'S WRONG?

412
00:18:02,499 --> 00:18:04,001
(SOBBING)

413
00:18:11,216 --> 00:18:13,343
OH WHOA!

414
00:18:13,427 --> 00:18:14,344
OKAY. PUTTING GREEN
AND DRIVING NET

415
00:18:14,428 --> 00:18:15,637
AT YOUR DISPOSAL?

416
00:18:15,721 --> 00:18:18,182
YOU ARE REALLY INTO THIS.

417
00:18:18,265 --> 00:18:19,766
OKAY.
MY TURN.

418
00:18:19,850 --> 00:18:21,351
OKAY.

419
00:18:24,771 --> 00:18:26,940
OKAY. TRY AND HOLD IT LIKE
YOU'RE HOLDING A BIRD.

420
00:18:27,024 --> 00:18:28,692
FIRM ENOUGH
SO IT CAN'T FLY AWAY,

421
00:18:28,775 --> 00:18:31,737
BUT GENTLE ENOUGH
THAT YOU DON'T HURT IT.

422
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:34,198
TRY AND FOCUS ON THE BACK
OF THE BALL. HERE.

423
00:18:35,449 --> 00:18:36,950
I GOT IT.

424
00:18:44,082 --> 00:18:45,834
OH WEEE!

425
00:18:45,918 --> 00:18:48,754
HA! MY KNEE DOESN'T EVEN HURT!

426
00:18:48,837 --> 00:18:51,423
THERE'S JUST SOMETHING ABOUT
FOCUSING ALL MY ENERGY

427
00:18:51,507 --> 00:18:53,926
ON HITTING THAT BALL
AS HARD AS I CAN.

428
00:18:54,009 --> 00:18:55,385
YOU KNOW, WE SHOULD
TOTALLY START

429
00:18:55,469 --> 00:18:58,013
THE FIRST EVER DEGRASSI
GOLF TEAM.

430
00:18:58,096 --> 00:19:00,766
I LIKE IT,
I LIKE IT.

431
00:19:00,849 --> 00:19:02,351
YOU KNOW,
SINCE YOU'RE A SPORTO,

432
00:19:04,937 --> 00:19:06,188
WHY DON'T YOU COME
TO MY GAME TOMORROW.

433
00:19:06,271 --> 00:19:07,189
I'VE GOT TWO EXTRA TICKETS,

434
00:19:07,272 --> 00:19:09,149
AND I DON'T WANT THEM
TO GO TO WASTE.

435
00:19:09,233 --> 00:19:11,401
I LIKE WATCHING SPORTS.

436
00:19:11,485 --> 00:19:13,320
YOU REALLY ARE
THE WHOLE PACKAGE.

437
00:19:15,572 --> 00:19:17,074
JUST, UH,

438
00:19:19,243 --> 00:19:22,079
DROPPING OFF SOME STUFF
FROM THE GARDEN SHOW.

439
00:19:22,162 --> 00:19:23,914
I THOUGHT
YOU HAD HOMEWORK.

440
00:19:23,997 --> 00:19:25,499
OH, WELL,
THIS... IS HOMEWORK.

441
00:19:25,582 --> 00:19:27,292
PHYSICS.

442
00:19:27,376 --> 00:19:28,877
OH OKAY.

443
00:19:34,508 --> 00:19:36,218
SURE HE'S NOT
YOUR BOYFRIEND?

444
00:19:36,301 --> 00:19:39,638
POSITIVE. WE JUST BUILT THIS
GARDEN TOGETHER, SO...

445
00:19:39,721 --> 00:19:41,682
LET'S HIT SOME MORE BALLS.

446
00:19:43,851 --> 00:19:45,352
MAN:
OKAY. THANKS.

447
00:19:49,273 --> 00:19:50,774
LOUIE MORENO:
PRINCESS I...

448
00:20:03,287 --> 00:20:04,413
VOLTA LIKED TO LIE
IN THE DRIVEWAY

449
00:20:04,496 --> 00:20:07,624
AND WATCH THE NEIGHBOURS
WALK BY.

450
00:20:07,708 --> 00:20:09,751
BUT DAD WAS RUSHING.

451
00:20:09,835 --> 00:20:11,170
ANYBODY COULD HAVE HIT HIM

452
00:20:11,253 --> 00:20:12,629
IF THEY WEREN'T
PAYING ATTENTION.

453
00:20:12,713 --> 00:20:14,965
IT'S NOT THAT HE HIT HIM,

454
00:20:15,048 --> 00:20:17,593
IT'S THAT
HE DIDN'T REMEMBER.

455
00:20:17,676 --> 00:20:19,094
MAYBE HE DIDN'T REALIZE...

456
00:20:19,178 --> 00:20:20,679
HE WASN'T A SMALL DOG.

457
00:20:24,516 --> 00:20:26,435
I THINK YOUR DAD
SHOULD SEE A DOCTOR.

458
00:20:32,608 --> 00:20:34,109
MAYBE YOU SHOULD TALK
TO YOUR MOM.

459
00:20:34,193 --> 00:20:35,235
SO SHE CAN FORCE ME
TO MOVE IN WITH HER

460
00:20:35,319 --> 00:20:37,070
AND LEAVE HIM ALONE.
NO THANK YOU.

461
00:20:37,154 --> 00:20:38,655
WHAT HAPPENED?!

462
00:20:41,909 --> 00:20:43,493
(EXHALES)
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

463
00:20:43,577 --> 00:20:44,244
I GOT YOUR MESSAGE
ABOUT POSTPONING DINNER

464
00:20:44,328 --> 00:20:45,621
AND GOT WORRIED.

465
00:20:45,704 --> 00:20:46,538
THERE'S NOTHING
TO WORRY ABOUT.

466
00:20:46,622 --> 00:20:48,123
I'M FINE.
EVERYTHING'S FINE.

467
00:20:49,666 --> 00:20:51,752
THEN WHY DID YOU CANCEL?

468
00:20:51,835 --> 00:20:53,837
YOU MADE A COMMITMENT,
YOU NEED TO RESPECT IT.

469
00:20:53,921 --> 00:20:55,881
YOU'RE ONE TO LECTURE ME
ABOUT RESPECTING COMMITMENTS.

470
00:20:58,383 --> 00:20:58,842
IF YOUR FRIEND WOULDN'T
MIND GIVING US A LITTLE SPACE,

471
00:20:58,926 --> 00:21:00,802
WE NEED TO TALK.

472
00:21:00,886 --> 00:21:02,971
FIONA'S NOT MY FRIEND,
SHE'S MY GIRLFRIEND.

473
00:21:03,055 --> 00:21:04,932
AND SHE'S NOT GOING
ANYWHERE.

474
00:21:11,605 --> 00:21:14,566
I DIDN'T KNOW YOU
HAD A GIRLFRIEND.

475
00:21:14,650 --> 00:21:16,568
OR THAT YOU ARE A LESBIAN.

476
00:21:19,238 --> 00:21:21,698
WELL, NATALIE,

477
00:21:21,782 --> 00:21:23,700
THERE'S A LOT YOU DON'T
KNOW ABOUT ME.

478
00:21:23,784 --> 00:21:25,994
AND I'D LIKE TO KEEP IT
THAT WAY.

479
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,585
IT'S NICE TO MEET YOU.

480
00:21:45,097 --> 00:21:46,598
(CAR DOOR OPENS AND SLAMS SHUT)
