00:00:18,685 --> 00:00:20,020
I'VE GOT A GOOD FEELING
ABOUT HOCKEY TOO.

00:00:20,103 --> 00:00:20,729
THAT WAS YOUR FIRST
PRACTICE BACK

9
00:00:20,812 --> 00:00:21,939

00:02:58,679 --> 00:03:00,889
HAVE BEEN SCHEDULED
IN BETWEEN CLASSES.

REASON TO MISS CLASS, PEOPLE.

74
00:03:03,308 --> 00:03:06,228
SORRY, CAN'T SHOW FAVOURITISM
TOWARDS A TEAM LEADER'S CRUSH.

00:03:06,311 --> 00:03:08,981
I DON'T HAVE A CRUSH ON
ALLI BHANDARI.

00:03:09,064 --> 00:03:10,566
OKAY, YEAH,
SHE'S PRETTY HOT.

77
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:13,277
SO WHY DON'T YOU
JUST ASK HER OUT?

78
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,279
AHHH, I DON'T KNOW
IF SHE'LL SAY YES.

BUT...

THINGS WENT A LITTLE SOUTH

81
00:03:17,823 --> 00:03:18,824

SINCE THE BREAK.

82
00:03:18,907 --> 00:03:20,659

LACKING CONFIDENCE?

84

AN ALTERNATIVE TIMELINE?

FIONA,

86

AROUND HERE.

00:03:26,415 --> 00:03:27,916

DESERVEDLY SO.

88
00:03:30,252 --> 00:03:32,254

138
00:05:33,959 --> 00:05:35,627

148
00:05:59,943 --> 00:06:01,445
SORRY,
I MISSED THE LAST PART;

149
00:06:01,528 --> 00:06:03,363
THE LAUGHTER IN MY HEAD
WAS TOO LOUD.

150
00:06:03,447 --> 00:06:05,407
OW! WAY TO HURT A BROTHER.

151
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:07,159
HA! AS IF MIKE DALLAS
FEELS PAIN.

152
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:11,872
THAT WAS A HINT.

153
00:06:12,998 --> 00:06:14,583
WE SHOULD GO
ON A DATE.

154
00:06:17,753 --> 00:06:18,587
HOW MANY CAR WRECKS
DO I HAVE TO PULL YOU OUT OF

155
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:20,839
TO PROVE I'M NOT A JERK?

156
00:06:20,923 --> 00:06:22,299
I DON'T THINK
YOU'RE A JERK.

157
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:24,927
RIGHT.
I DON'T!

158
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:26,470
IT'S JUST THAT NIGHT
WE WENT TO THE JAY-Z CONCERT

159
00:06:26,553 --> 00:06:27,930
WAS A DISASTER,

160
00:06:28,013 --> 00:06:31,099
AND LOOK,

161
00:06:31,183 --> 00:06:33,268
WE'RE NOT EVEN ON
THE SAME SPIRIT TEAM!

162
00:06:33,352 --> 00:06:35,354
FATE JUST SEEMS TO BE SAYING
"NO" TO A DALLAS-ALLI UNION.

163
00:06:35,437 --> 00:06:36,855
WELL, I DON'T BELIEVE
IN FATE.

164
00:06:36,939 --> 00:06:38,315
I BELIEVE IN HARD WORK,

165
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:40,526
AND I'M WILLING TO WORK
VERY HARD FOR YOU.

166
00:06:42,736 --> 00:06:44,321
YOU KNOW,
LET'S MAKE A BET.

167
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:46,323
IF MY TEAM RED WINS
THE SPIRIT WEEK,

168
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:48,325
YOU GO ON A DATE WITH ME.
DEAL?

169
00:06:49,826 --> 00:06:51,328
FINE. DEAL.

170
00:06:53,247 --> 00:06:53,830
BUT MY TEAM PURPLE
MIGHT JUST GIVE YOU

171
00:06:53,914 --> 00:06:54,706
A RUN FOR YOUR MONEY.

172
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:56,583
OH YEAH?

173
00:06:56,667 --> 00:06:58,335
WELL, THERE'S ONE THING
I KNOW HOW TO DO,

174
00:06:58,418 --> 00:06:59,920
IT'S WIN.

175

AND KATIE'S IN CHARGE,

350
00:14:58,732 --> 00:15:01,610

HE HAS PROBLEMS

363
00:15:30,222 --> 00:15:31,974
AND YOU JUST YELLED AT HIM
AND MADE HIM CRY!

364
00:15:32,057 --> 00:15:32,599
SO HE RAN CRYING TO YOU,
DID HE?

365
00:15:32,683 --> 00:15:34,518

ON STRAIGHT.

368
00:15:38,438 --> 00:15:39,648

WHEN I WAS EIGHT-YEARS-OLD,

389
00:16:26,904 --> 00:16:27,738
I WENT TO MY FIRST
OVERNIGHT CAMP

390
00:16:27,821 --> 00:16:28,697
AND WAS TERRIFIED,

391
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:30,908
SO MY PARENTS GOT ME HOOT

392
00:16:30,991 --> 00:16:32,201
AND THEY SAID
AS LONG AS HE WAS THERE

393
00:16:32,284 --> 00:16:34,995
I WOULDN'T BE LONELY.

394
00:16:35,078 --> 00:16:36,163
