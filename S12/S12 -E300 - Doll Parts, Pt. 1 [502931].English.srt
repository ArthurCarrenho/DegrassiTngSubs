72
00:03:03,267 --> 00:03:04,852
I NEED GIRL TALK.

73
00:03:04,935 --> 00:03:06,979
WHAT'S WRONG?

74
00:03:07,062 --> 00:03:07,604
I TRIED TO MAKE OUT
WITH CAM,

75
00:03:07,688 --> 00:03:09,314
BUT HE WOULDN'T.

76
00:03:09,398 --> 00:03:10,983
MAYBE YOU'RE SENDING HIM
MIXED SIGNALS.

77

I TOOK MY SHIRT OFF.

78
00:03:13,318 --> 00:03:14,736
THAT'S KIND OF GUIDING HIM
ONTO THE RUNWAY, ISN'T IT?

79
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:16,488
RIGHT? AND STILL...
CRASH LANDING

80
00:03:16,572 --> 00:03:18,073

81
00:03:19,283 --> 00:03:21,118

136
00:05:14,189 --> 00:05:15,858
AT THIS RATE,
IT'S GONNA TAKE ME 33 WEEKS

137
00:05:15,941 --> 00:05:17,359
TO GET UP

138
00:05:17,442 --> 00:05:19,069

ONE WEEK TO GET OVER ME.

143
00:05:29,204 --> 00:05:30,539
OH, AND I WAS THINKING OF
GOING OUT FOR A SPORTS TEAM.

144

145
00:05:32,124 --> 00:05:33,375
ADAM:
VOLLEYBALL.

146
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:34,877
I'VE BEEN PRACTICING
FOR THE LAST FEW WEEKS

147
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:37,629

I HAVE A CHANCE.

148

AUDRA:
YOU GUYS BETTER HOPE
AND PRAY

149
00:05:39,173 --> 00:05:41,049

152
00:05:43,468 --> 00:05:44,386

154
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:48,849
HOW MANY EGGS AND CHICKEN
CAN TWO KIDS EAT?

155
00:05:48,932 --> 00:05:52,019
WELL, DEPENDS ON
WHAT CAME FIRST.

156
00:05:52,102 --> 00:05:55,105
HEY, ADAM, JUST BE CAREFUL
WITH THE WEIGHTS, OKAY?

157
00:05:55,189 --> 00:05:56,607
ADAM:
IT'S ONLY A THIRD

158
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:58,859

A FEW MORE MUSCLES.

160
00:06:01,862 --> 00:06:03,488
IF YOU'D LET ME
START TAKING T,

161
00:06:03,572 --> 00:06:05,532
I'D HAVE MUSCLES
LIKE DALLAS

162
00:06:05,616 --> 00:06:07,576
AND FACIAL HAIR LIKE DALLAS,
AND A DEEP VOICE-

163
00:06:07,659 --> 00:06:09,161

ADAM, WE'VE BEEN OVER THIS,
OKAY?

166
00:06:13,165 --> 00:06:15,709
THE ANSWER IS STILL NO.

167
00:06:15,792 --> 00:06:16,960
IN THE MEANTIME,
PLEASE JUST BE CAREFUL

168
00:06:17,044 --> 00:06:18,545
WITH ALL THE PHYSICAL STUFF.

169
00:06:18,629 --> 00:06:20,923

253
00:09:38,245 --> 00:09:39,746
ADAM, A WORD PLEASE?

254
00:09:43,584 --> 00:09:45,294
SIR, IF YOU HAVE CONCERNS
ABOUT ME TRYING OUT-

255
00:09:45,377 --> 00:09:46,879
ONLY ONE.

256
00:09:48,088 --> 00:09:50,465
YOU NEED A SIGNED
PERMISSION FORM.

257
00:09:50,549 --> 00:09:53,177
I NEED ONE?
ONLY ME?

258
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:56,263
NO. EVERYBODY ELSE ALREADY
HANDED THEIRS IN.

259
00:09:56,346 --> 00:09:57,347
I KNOW YOUR MOM'S BEEN
CONCERNED ABOUT YOU

260

IN THE PAST
IN GYM CLASS,

261
00:09:59,266 --> 00:10:00,767
BUT THERE'S VERY LITTLE RISK
OF GETTING HURT.

262
00:10:00,851 --> 00:10:02,144
I KNOW.

263
00:10:02,227 --> 00:10:03,604
YOU'RE A DARN FINE SETTER.

264
00:10:03,687 --> 00:10:05,772
MAYBE TELL YOUR MOM THAT.

270
00:10:28,128 --> 00:10:30,589
WHY EXACTLY DO YOU
LOOK LIKE THIS?

271
00:10:32,633 --> 00:10:34,134
I WAS THINKING OF ENTERING
ONE OF TORI'S BEAUTY PAGEANTS

272
00:10:34,218 --> 00:10:34,968
WITH HER.

273
00:10:35,052 --> 00:10:37,471
WHY?

274
00:10:37,554 --> 00:10:39,598
I MEAN, IT'S NOT REALLY
YOUR THING.

275
00:10:39,681 --> 00:10:41,308
BECAUSE I'M NOT
PRETTY ENOUGH?

276
00:10:41,391 --> 00:10:44,311
NO. NO, NO, NO.
IT'S JUST...

277
00:10:44,394 --> 00:10:46,230
I DON'T KNOW...
IT'S NOT YOU.

278
00:10:46,313 --> 00:10:48,565
SO YOU DON'T LIKE THIS?

279
00:10:48,649 --> 00:10:50,067
DO YOU?

280
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:51,902
FORGET IT!

281
00:10:51,985 --> 00:10:54,196

WHAT YOU WANT!

285
00:11:22,599 --> 00:11:24,101
WHOA.

286
00:11:25,185 --> 00:11:25,936
GREAT! YOU THINK I LOOK
RIDICULOUS TOO.

287
00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:28,021
NO. NO, NO, NO.

288
00:11:28,105 --> 00:11:30,190
I'M ACTUALLY KINDA DIGGING
THE RACCOON EYES.

289
00:11:30,274 --> 00:11:31,733
SHUT IT.

290
00:11:31,817 --> 00:11:32,317
ARE YOU ROBBING
A BANK LATER?

291
00:11:32,401 --> 00:11:33,902
STOP!

292
00:11:36,363 --> 00:11:39,867
I SHOWED CAM MY PAGEANT LOOK
AND HE LAUGHED HIS HEAD OFF.

293
00:11:39,950 --> 00:11:41,410
WHAT? YOU'RE ENTERING
THE PAGEANT?

294
00:11:41,493 --> 00:11:43,328
BUT YOU THINK
THEY'RE DUMB.

295
00:11:43,412 --> 00:11:46,206
WELL, TORI'S BOYFRIEND
LIKES THAT SHE DOES THEM.

296
00:11:46,290 --> 00:11:47,791
I JUST THOUGHT
THAT CAM WOULD TOO.

297
00:11:47,875 --> 00:11:49,376
I WAS WRONG.

298
00:11:51,336 --> 00:11:52,337
WHY DO YOU LIKE THAT
TORI'S A BEAUTY QUEEN?

299
00:11:52,421 --> 00:11:53,881
WHEN TORI'S ON STAGE,

300
00:11:53,964 --> 00:11:55,048
SHE ACTS LIKE SHE OWNS
THE ROOM,

301
00:11:55,132 --> 00:11:57,301
AND I WANNA BE
AROUND THAT.

302
00:11:57,384 --> 00:11:58,385
YOU MEAN YOU WANNA
MAKE OUT WITH THAT!

303
00:11:58,468 --> 00:11:59,970
WELL...

304
00:12:01,305 --> 00:12:03,473
SO ARE YOU GONNA
ENTER?

305
00:12:03,557 --> 00:12:06,143
NO WAY.

306
00:12:06,226 --> 00:12:09,354
JUST 'CAUSE WHAT
CAM THINKS?

307
00:12:09,438 --> 00:12:11,190
IF YOU WANT TO DO THE PAGEANT,
THEN GO FOR IT.

308
00:12:11,273 --> 00:12:12,816
BUT I HAVE TO WEAR HEELS
AND A GOWN

309
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:14,735
AND PERFORM A TALENT

310
00:12:14,818 --> 00:12:17,237
IN FRONT OF A BUNCH

311
00:12:17,321 --> 00:12:18,447

THOSE OTHER GIRLS.

315

SO YOU REALLY THINK
I HAVE A SHOT?

316
00:12:26,455 --> 00:12:28,999
I DO.

317
00:12:29,082 --> 00:12:31,668
BUT, UH, YOU MIGHT WANNA
FIX YOUR EYES FIRST.

318
00:12:35,005 --> 00:12:36,423
THERE'S SOMETHING
I HAVE TO TELL YOU -

319
00:12:36,507 --> 00:12:38,008
A SECRET -
ABOUT ME.

320
00:12:39,635 --> 00:12:41,803

324
00:12:55,067 --> 00:12:57,402
I SAID, I CHEATED ON
MY LAST MATH TEST!

325
00:12:57,486 --> 00:12:59,613
DID YOU GET CAUGHT?

326
00:12:59,696 --> 00:13:01,281
NO, I DIDN'T.
UM, YOUR TURN.

327
00:13:04,368 --> 00:13:05,702
TELL ME SOMETHING
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU.

328
00:13:05,786 --> 00:13:07,621
UH...

329
00:13:07,704 --> 00:13:09,248
A SECRET.

330
00:13:09,331 --> 00:13:10,832
IT'S A GAME.

331
00:13:11,792 --> 00:13:13,502
ARE YOU NERVOUS?

332
00:13:13,585 --> 00:13:15,295
NO.

333
00:13:15,379 --> 00:13:16,213
THEN WHY ARE YOU
SWEATING BUCKETS?

334
00:13:16,296 --> 00:13:17,714
I AM?

335
00:13:17,798 --> 00:13:19,758
HUH?

336
00:13:19,842 --> 00:13:21,009
YOU'RE NOT EVEN LISTENING
TO ME.

337
00:13:21,093 --> 00:13:22,177
WHAT'S GOING ON
WITH YOU?

338
00:13:22,261 --> 00:13:23,387
I NEED TO TAKE A LEAK.

339
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:25,013
I'M TRYING
TO TALK TO YOU.

340
00:13:25,097 --> 00:13:26,598
FIRST LEAK,
THEN TALK.

341
00:13:31,395 --> 00:13:33,397
ADAM:
HEY, MOM,

342
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:35,607
CAN I FLOAT AN IDEA
BY YOU?

343
00:13:35,691 --> 00:13:37,317

OH. HEY! YEAH.
YOU STARTLED ME.

00:13:37,401 --> 00:13:38,819
ADAM:
SORRY.

345
00:13:38,902 --> 00:13:41,113
ARE YOU CRYING?

346
00:13:41,196 --> 00:13:43,115
NO, NO. IT'S NOTHING.
I'M FINE.

348
00:13:51,123 --> 00:13:52,624
YOU MISS HIM.

349
00:13:56,587 --> 00:13:58,547
I BASICALLY
DROVE HIM AWAY.

350
00:13:58,630 --> 00:14:00,924
NO, YOU DIDN'T.

351
00:14:01,008 --> 00:14:03,886
AUDRA:
HE'S GOT SERIOUS
MEDICAL ISSUES.

352
00:14:03,969 --> 00:14:05,345
HE DROPPED OUT OF SCHOOL.

353
00:14:05,429 --> 00:14:06,930
HE'S MOVED OUT.

354
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:12,811
NOW HE THINKS HE'S GETTING
MARRIED THIS SUMMER.

355
00:14:12,895 --> 00:14:14,396
GETTING MARRIED?
TO BIANCA?!

356

APPARENTLY.

357
00:14:19,026 --> 00:14:20,485
DON'T WORRY.

358
00:14:20,569 --> 00:14:21,278
HE'LL FIND A WAY
TO MESS IT UP.

359
00:14:21,361 --> 00:14:23,614
HE ALWAYS DOES.

360
00:14:23,697 --> 00:14:26,325
I'M NOT SURE IF THAT MAKES ME
FEEL BETTER OR WORSE.

361
00:14:26,408 --> 00:14:27,993
SOMETIMES I THINK HIS BEHAVIOUR
IS ALL MY FAULT.

362
00:14:28,076 --> 00:14:29,578
IT'S NOT.

363
00:14:31,705 --> 00:14:34,666
I CAN'T EVEN KEEP
MY CHILDREN SAFE.

364
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:36,251
WE DON'T EXACTLY
MAKE IT EASY.

365
00:14:38,587 --> 00:14:40,214
MORE EVIDENCE THAT I'M AWFUL -

366
00:14:40,297 --> 00:14:41,965
HAVING MY OWN CHILD
REASSURE ME.

367
00:14:42,049 --> 00:14:43,550
I'M NOT A CHILD.

368
00:14:45,052 --> 00:14:46,553
NO, YOU'RE NOT...

369
00:14:50,265 --> 00:14:51,767
AND YOU'RE STILL HERE.

370
00:14:53,310 --> 00:14:54,811

WE HAD A FIGHT, SO NO.

376
00:15:17,376 --> 00:15:18,544
I FORGOT ABOUT
THE AUDIENCE PART -

377
00:15:18,627 --> 00:15:20,295
THAT THERE WOULD BE ONE.

378
00:15:20,379 --> 00:15:22,548
AND WHAT ABOUT
THE OTHER CONTESTANTS?

379
00:15:22,631 --> 00:15:24,174

WITH A WRENCH, ARE THEY?

ABOUT JEALOUSY.

OH. BECAUSE I DON'T
HAVE ANY SHOT

UM...

484
00:19:48,647 --> 00:19:50,440

00:19:50,524 --> 00:19:52,192

490
00:20:04,538 --> 00:20:05,664
WHY WOULD MO HAVE
A NEEDLE?

491
00:20:05,747 --> 00:20:08,667
BECAUSE MO DOES DRUGS,
KATIE.

492
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:10,836
IT'S THE ONLY EXPLANATION.

493
00:20:10,919 --> 00:20:13,881
HE WAS ACTING
COMPLETELY STONED

494
00:20:13,964 --> 00:20:16,049
AND HE COULDN'T EVEN FOLLOW
A SIMPLE CONVERSATION!

495
00:20:16,133 --> 00:20:18,010
NO, THERE MUST BE
ANOTHER REASON-

496
00:20:18,093 --> 00:20:20,679
AND THEN HE BOLTS OUT OF THERE
LIKE HE'S JONESING BIG-TIME.

497
00:20:20,762 --> 00:20:22,472
A FEW MINUTES LATER
HE GETS BACK

498
00:20:22,556 --> 00:20:24,725
AND ACTS LIKE
NOTHING HAPPENED.

499
00:20:24,808 --> 00:20:27,102
IN HIS DEFENSE,

500
00:20:27,186 --> 00:20:29,646
MO ISN'T THE TYPE
TO DO DRUGS.

501
00:20:29,730 --> 00:20:32,232
NEITHER WERE YOU.

502
00:20:32,316 --> 00:20:34,026
OKAY...

503
00:20:34,109 --> 00:20:36,320
LOOK, I NEED
TO CONFRONT HIM.

504
00:20:36,403 --> 00:20:38,447
GET HIM TO ADMIT
THE TRUTH,

505
00:20:38,530 --> 00:20:40,240
AND THEN MAKE HIM STOP.

506
00:20:43,452 --> 00:20:45,204
ARE YOU SURE ABOUT THIS?

507
00:20:47,414 --> 00:20:49,333

I WANT A GUY LIKE ZIG.

00:20:52,461 --> 00:20:53,962
EMPHASIS LIKE.

511
00:20:55,881 --> 00:20:57,424
TORI, HE TREATS YOU
LIKE A QUEEN,

512
00:20:57,508 --> 00:20:59,092
AND HE MAKES YOU FEEL GOOD
ABOUT YOURSELF EVERY DAY.

513
00:20:59,176 --> 00:21:01,136
AND YOU SHOULD TOTALLY
HAVE THAT TOO.

514

OUR FIGHT TOO,

519
00:21:19,655 --> 00:21:21,657
BUT...

520
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:25,369
I'VE BEEN THINKING...

521
00:21:25,452 --> 00:21:26,954
WE SHOULD TAKE
A BREAK.

522
00:21:28,247 --> 00:21:31,041
NOT A BREAK, NO.
WE SHOULD JUST BREAK UP.

523
00:21:31,124 --> 00:21:33,961
