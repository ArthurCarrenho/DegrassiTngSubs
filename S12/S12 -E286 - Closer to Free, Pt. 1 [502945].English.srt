00:06:49,034 --> 00:06:51,286
BUT I HAVE TO FINISH THIS
STUPID HEALTH ASSIGNMENT.

179
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:52,913
(SIGHS)

180
00:06:52,996 --> 00:06:53,914
THIS CONCUSSION
IS RUINING MY LIFE.

181
00:06:53,997 --> 00:06:56,166
I CAN'T DO ANYTHING FUN.

182
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:57,751
THAT'S NOT TRUE.

183
00:07:03,841 --> 00:07:06,176
AUDRA:
(CLEARS HER THROAT)

184
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:08,178
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO RELAXING
AFTER SCHOOL, DREW.

185
00:07:08,262 --> 00:07:10,973
UM... THAT WAS RELAXING.

186
00:07:11,056 --> 00:07:13,475
MM-HM.
AND YOU, MISS BIANCA,

187
00:07:13,559 --> 00:07:16,186
SHOULD BE WORKING ON
YOUR UNIVERSITY APPLICATIONS.

188
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:17,896
FOR THE APPLICATION FEE.

189
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:19,481
THANK YOU,
MRS. TORRES.

190
00:07:19,565 --> 00:07:21,483
YOU'RE GONNA GET THIS BACK,
EVERY PENNY.

191
00:07:21,567 --> 00:07:24,903
SCHOOL'S IMPORTANT -
FOR BOTH OF YOU.

192
00:07:24,987 --> 00:07:27,364
THEN WHY IS IT I CAN'T DO
THE ONE CLASS I'M NOT FAILING?

193
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:29,616
BECAUSE THE DOCTOR SAID
THAT ANOTHER INJURY

194
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:31,702
COULD LEAD
TO PERMANENT DAMAGE.

195
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:37,916
AUDRA'S JUST LOOKING OUT
FOR YOU, DREW.

196
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,586
HOW? BY MAKING ME FEEL STUPID
AND SMOTHERED?

197
00:07:40,669 --> 00:07:42,379
OKAY.

198
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:44,256
LET'S FOCUS ON
YOUR ASSIGNMENT.

199
00:07:44,339 --> 00:07:46,258
FOR EVERY MUSCLE
YOU REMEMBER,

200
00:07:46,341 --> 00:07:47,926
YOU CAN HAVE ONE OF THESE.

201
00:07:49,845 --> 00:07:52,181
YOU HAVE ANOTHER HEADACHE?

202
00:07:52,264 --> 00:07:53,849
OKAY, MAYBE YOU SHOULD
JUST RELAX.

203
00:07:53,932 --> 00:07:56,268
FOR REAL THIS TIME.

204
00:07:56,351 --> 00:07:57,603
WHAT ABOUT MY HEALTH
ASSIGNMENT?

205
00:07:57,686 --> 00:07:59,271
DON'T WORRY,

206
00:07:59,354 --> 00:08:01,356
IT'LL BE FINISHED
WHEN YOU WAKE UP.

207
00:08:10,157 --> 00:08:11,575
I PICKED UP SAMOSAS
AT THE STORE.

208
00:08:11,658 --> 00:08:12,409
THOUGHT THEY WOULD INSPIRE
SOME GREAT IDEAS

209
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:13,994
FOR OUR PRESENTATION.

210
00:08:15,537 --> 00:08:16,663
I THINK WE SHOULD JUST OPEN UP
WITH A MAP OF INDIA,

211
00:08:16,747 --> 00:08:17,581
SHOWING HOW EACH
TERRITORY JOINED,

212
00:08:17,664 --> 00:08:19,166
AND WHEN.

213
00:08:19,249 --> 00:08:20,834
ASHER SAYS WE NEED
TO DIG DEEP,

214
00:08:20,918 --> 00:08:22,753
FIND THE NARRATIVE
IN THE WORK.

215
00:08:22,836 --> 00:08:24,338
WHO'S ASHER?

216
00:08:26,632 --> 00:08:30,594
WELL, THE ASSIGNMENT SAYS
WE'RE SUPPOSED TO, QUOTE,

217
00:08:30,677 --> 00:08:32,095
"PICK A COMMONWEALTH COUNTRY,
ILLUSTRATE HOW THEY JOINED,

218
00:08:32,179 --> 00:08:33,263
AND DISCUSS WHETHER
THEIR MEMBERSHIP

219
00:08:33,347 --> 00:08:35,474
WAS POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE."
END QUOTE.

220
00:08:35,557 --> 00:08:37,559
AND WE'LL DO THAT...

221
00:08:37,643 --> 00:08:39,228
THROUGH A MULTI-SENSORY
EXPERIENCE

222
00:08:39,311 --> 00:08:42,731
THAT TRANSPORTS
OUR AUDIENCE TO INDIA.

223
00:08:42,814 --> 00:08:44,942
IT'S A GRADE ELEVEN
GEOGRAPHY ASSIGNMENT.

224
00:08:45,025 --> 00:08:47,277
LET'S JUST GET THE "A"
AND GET OUT.

225
00:08:47,361 --> 00:08:48,070
BUT ASHER SAYS,
EVERY PIECE OF WORK

226
00:08:48,153 --> 00:08:50,697
NEEDS TO BE YOUR BEST WORK.

227
00:08:50,781 --> 00:08:53,659
ADAM:
WOW. THIS ASHER GUY SOUNDS
LIKE A REAL PIECE OF WORK.

228
00:08:55,827 --> 00:08:58,330
YOU KNOW WHAT?

229
00:08:58,413 --> 00:09:00,916
CLEARLY, YOU GUYS
DON'T SHARE MY VISION.

230
00:09:00,999 --> 00:09:03,377
YOU CAN GO.
I'LL DO THE PROJECT MYSELF.

231
00:09:06,964 --> 00:09:08,757
JENNA:
♪ WALK WITH ME ♪

232
00:09:08,841 --> 00:09:12,886
♪ I FEEL MY SPIRIT RISE ♪

233
00:09:15,514 --> 00:09:17,015
(APPLAUSE)

234
00:09:21,645 --> 00:09:22,729
BECKY:
UM, EVERYONE,
SNACKS ARE IN THE KITCHEN.

235
00:09:22,813 --> 00:09:24,314
AND I'LL MEET YOU THERE.

236
00:09:25,858 --> 00:09:27,359
WASN'T THAT FUN?

237
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:30,112
UM, YOU'RE LEAVING.

238
00:09:31,905 --> 00:09:33,282
YOU'RE MAD?
YOU LIED TO ME!

239
00:09:33,365 --> 00:09:35,075
I DIDN'T LIE.
LYING'S A SIN.

240
00:09:35,158 --> 00:09:36,285
I JUST LEFT OUT
A FEW DETAILS.

241
00:09:36,368 --> 00:09:37,536
DID YOU INVITE ME OVER

242
00:09:37,619 --> 00:09:38,537
BECAUSE YOU THINK
I NEED SAVING

243
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:39,955
OR SOMETHING?

244
00:09:40,038 --> 00:09:41,164
NO. I WAS JUST TRYING
TO HELP.

245
00:09:41,248 --> 00:09:42,708
YOU SAID YOU NEEDED
A FRIEND!

246
00:09:42,791 --> 00:09:44,543
OH, SO I'M LIKE
YOUR CHARITY CASE?

247
00:09:44,626 --> 00:09:46,962
NO! JENNA, I'M SORRY.
YOU'RE MISUNDERSTANDING ME!

248
00:09:47,045 --> 00:09:48,755
NO,
YOU'RE MISUNDERSTANDING ME.

249
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:51,175
I'M NOT CHRISTIAN,
BECKY.

250
00:09:51,258 --> 00:09:53,385
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
IF I BELIEVE IN GOD.

251
00:09:54,052 --> 00:09:55,596
I'LL LET MY SELF OUT.

252
00:09:59,683 --> 00:10:01,268
(SIGHS)

253
00:10:01,351 --> 00:10:02,853
(BELL RINGS)

254
00:10:05,898 --> 00:10:07,357
JENNA:
THEN SHE WAS LIKE, OH,
P.S. THIS IS MY CHURCH GROUP.

255
00:10:07,441 --> 00:10:09,693
THE NERVE!

256
00:10:09,776 --> 00:10:11,111
DAVE:
WELL, I GUESS YOU AND BECKY
WON'T BE BESTIES FOREVSIES!

257
00:10:11,195 --> 00:10:12,446
JENNA:
NOT A CHANCE IN HELL.

258
00:10:12,529 --> 00:10:14,948
WELL, CAN'T SAY
I DIDN'T WARN YOU.

259
00:10:15,032 --> 00:10:16,783
WELL, YOU DIDN'T TELL ME
SHE WAS CHRISTIAN!

260
00:10:16,867 --> 00:10:18,410
WAIT. THE PROBLEM IS THAT
SHE LIED, RIGHT?

261
00:10:18,493 --> 00:10:20,245
NOT THAT SHE'S CHRISTIAN.

262
00:10:20,329 --> 00:10:21,663
PERINO:
ATTENTION, CLASS.

263
00:10:21,747 --> 00:10:24,833
THE SUBJECT FOR YOUR MID-TERM
CREATIVE PROJECT IS...

264
00:10:24,917 --> 00:10:27,127
(IMITATES A DRUM ROLL)

265
00:10:27,211 --> 00:10:29,129
THE ELIZABETHAN ERA,
SHAKESPEARE,

266
00:10:29,213 --> 00:10:31,173
SPANISH ARMADAS,
COLONIZATION.

267
00:10:31,256 --> 00:10:33,717
GROUPS OF THREE.
GO GO GO GO!

268
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,636
ALLI,
WANNA PARTNER UP?

269
00:10:35,719 --> 00:10:37,137
DAVE:
NO, NO, NO.
BOYFRIENDS GET FIRST PRIORITY.

270
00:10:37,221 --> 00:10:38,764
PLUS, I ALREADY SAID
YES TO CONNOR.

271
00:10:38,847 --> 00:10:40,224
WELL, THAT'S OKAY.

272
00:10:40,307 --> 00:10:41,975
I'LL JUST PARTNER UP
WITH A RANDOM...

273
00:10:44,937 --> 00:10:46,438
HI.

274
00:10:46,522 --> 00:10:48,023
HELLO.

275
00:10:48,106 --> 00:10:49,608
ALLI:
RELAX. ACT NATURAL.

276
00:10:51,109 --> 00:10:52,778
WOULD YOU LIKE TO JOIN
MY GROUP?

277
00:10:53,487 --> 00:10:54,988
SHESS.
I MEAN, YES!

278
00:10:57,324 --> 00:10:58,825
I STARTED TO SAY SURE,
BUT I WAS THINKING YES.

279
00:10:58,909 --> 00:11:00,827
I'M LUKE.

280
00:11:00,911 --> 00:11:02,162
SO WHO'S OUR THIRD?!

281
00:11:02,246 --> 00:11:04,164
UH, MY SISTER.
I THINK YOU KNOW HER.

282
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:11,672
YOU'VE GOTTA BE
KIDDING ME.

283
00:11:15,467 --> 00:11:16,844
DID YOU FINISH
YOUR QUESTIONS, THOR?

284
00:11:16,927 --> 00:11:17,594
YUP.
DID YOU FINISH YOURS?

285
00:11:17,678 --> 00:11:19,179
YES, I DID.

286
00:11:19,263 --> 00:11:21,098
LET'S SWAP FAST
BEFORE ARMSTRONG SEES.

287
00:11:24,309 --> 00:11:26,144
CRAP. CRAP, CRAP,
CRAP, CRAP, CRAP.

288
00:11:28,188 --> 00:11:29,857
IS THIS A CONCUSSION THING,

289
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:30,482
WHERE YOU REPEAT THE SAME WORD
OVER AND OVER AGAIN?

290
00:11:30,566 --> 00:11:32,192
NO. NO.

291
00:11:32,276 --> 00:11:34,236
I DID MY ASSIGNMENT
LAST NIGHT, OR...

292
00:11:34,319 --> 00:11:36,029
BIANCA DID IT,
BUT...

293
00:11:36,113 --> 00:11:38,115
WELL, VITE!
IT'S DUE BY THE END OF CLASS.

294
00:11:38,198 --> 00:11:42,244
I COULD HAVE SWORE
I PUT IT IN MY BAG.

295
00:11:42,327 --> 00:11:44,705
OR MAYBE I LEFT IT
ON THE KITCHEN COUNTER.

296
00:11:44,788 --> 00:11:45,831
OH, DREW,
THINK, THINK.

297
00:11:45,914 --> 00:11:47,291
AGAIN WITH THE REPETITION.

298
00:11:47,374 --> 00:11:49,585
JUST BACK OFF, OKAY?

299
00:11:49,668 --> 00:11:52,337
IT'S NOT MY FAULT.
IT'S MY STUPID BRAIN!

300
00:11:52,421 --> 00:11:53,797
YOU KNOW, AT SOME POINT,
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO STOP

301
00:11:53,881 --> 00:11:55,716
BLAMING YOUR CONCUSSION
AND GET YOUR LIFE IN ORDER,

302
00:11:55,799 --> 00:11:59,178
ESPECIALLY WHEN PEOPLE
ARE COUNTING ON YOU.

303
00:11:59,261 --> 00:11:59,928
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?!

304
00:12:00,012 --> 00:12:01,513
NOWHERE.

305
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:04,141
MARKING RUBRICS
ARE ON MY DESK!

306
00:12:05,601 --> 00:12:07,102
I GOT IT.

307
00:12:09,813 --> 00:12:10,314
SO HOW ARE YOU
AND YOUR BROTHER

308
00:12:10,397 --> 00:12:12,149
IN THE SAME GRADE?

309
00:12:12,232 --> 00:12:13,442
LUKE'S ONLY ELEVEN MONTHS
OLDER,

310
00:12:13,525 --> 00:12:16,153
AND HE'S GREAT,

311
00:12:16,236 --> 00:12:19,323
BUT IT'S NOT THE SAME
AS HAVING A REAL GIRL FRIEND.

312
00:12:19,406 --> 00:12:20,699
SERIOUSLY, BECKY,

313
00:12:20,782 --> 00:12:21,825
WHY DO YOU WANNA BE
FRIENDS WITH ME?

314
00:12:21,909 --> 00:12:23,243
YOU HARDLY KNOW ME.

315
00:12:23,327 --> 00:12:25,579
WELL,
I CAN GET TO KNOW YOU.

316
00:12:25,662 --> 00:12:27,164
FINE.

317
00:12:27,873 --> 00:12:31,043
I HAD A BABY LAST YEAR

318
00:12:31,126 --> 00:12:34,588
AND I GAVE HIM UP
FOR ADOPTION.

319
00:12:34,671 --> 00:12:37,716
SO DOES THE CHRISTIAN GIRL
STILL WANNA BE FRIENDS NOW?

320
00:12:37,799 --> 00:12:39,301
DIDN'T THINK SO.

321
00:12:44,389 --> 00:12:46,099
THAT MUST HAVE BEEN
SO HARD.

322
00:12:47,559 --> 00:12:49,061
IT WAS.

323
00:12:56,443 --> 00:12:58,070
WAIT, WHY AREN'T YOU
BEING MORE JUDGEY?

324
00:12:58,153 --> 00:12:59,655
GOD DOESN'T CARE
ABOUT YOUR PAST

325
00:12:59,738 --> 00:13:02,241
AND NEITHER DO I.

326
00:13:02,324 --> 00:13:03,825
SO YOU'LL BE
IN OUR GROUP?

327
00:13:05,994 --> 00:13:09,122
PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE,
WITH A CHERRY ON TOP?

328
00:13:09,206 --> 00:13:10,499
WELL, WHEN YOU PUT IT
THAT WAY.

329
00:13:10,582 --> 00:13:12,084
(LAUGHING)

330
00:13:24,596 --> 00:13:26,390
ASHER:
NEWSIE,

331
00:13:26,473 --> 00:13:28,475
WASN'T YOUR CO-OP OVER
FOR THE DAY AN HOUR AGO?

332
00:13:28,559 --> 00:13:29,726
YEAH,
I JUST THOUGHT I'D STAY

333
00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:30,978
AND GET SOME WORK DONE
ON MY GROUP PROJECT

334
00:13:31,061 --> 00:13:33,063
BEFORE HEADING
BACK TO SCHOOL.

335
00:13:33,146 --> 00:13:35,232
WHERE'S YOUR GROUP?

336
00:13:35,315 --> 00:13:36,275
THEY DIDN'T SHARE
OUR ENTHUSIASM

337
00:13:36,358 --> 00:13:39,528
FOR INSIGHTFUL STORYTELLING.

338
00:13:39,611 --> 00:13:41,154
ASHER:
(LAUGHS) TOO BAD.
INDIA'S A FASCINATING ADVENTURE.

339
00:13:41,238 --> 00:13:43,365
HAVE YOU BEEN?

340
00:13:43,448 --> 00:13:44,408
WHILE I'VE GOT YOU,
MAYBE I CAN ASK YOU

341
00:13:44,491 --> 00:13:46,201
ABOUT ANOTHER
THRILLING ADVENTURE

342
00:13:46,285 --> 00:13:47,578
INTO THE ONLINE WORLD?

343
00:13:47,661 --> 00:13:48,620
OH, A STORY ON EMAIL SCAMS?

344
00:13:48,704 --> 00:13:51,123
NO.

345
00:13:51,206 --> 00:13:53,125
HOW DOES ONE GET SOMETHING
TRENDING ON TWITTER?

346
00:13:54,918 --> 00:13:56,420
REALLY?

347
00:13:57,588 --> 00:13:58,714
WELL, I CAN SHOW YOU.

348
00:13:58,797 --> 00:14:00,299
I PREFER TO BE
A LUDDITE,

349
00:14:00,382 --> 00:14:01,675
REMAINING AS "OFFLINE"
AS POSSIBLE.

350
00:14:01,758 --> 00:14:03,260
BUT MY EDITOR
PREFERS OTHERWISE.

351
00:14:05,596 --> 00:14:07,097
CLARE:
OKAY. WELL, THIS IS ME.

352
00:14:07,181 --> 00:14:08,974
THERE ARE A FEW WAYS
TO GET STUFF TRENDING.

353
00:14:09,057 --> 00:14:10,309
FIRST, YOU NEED TO ADD
A HASHTAG TO YOUR TWEETS.

354
00:14:10,392 --> 00:14:12,019
IT'S HELPFUL
IF IT'S CATCHY.

355
00:14:12,102 --> 00:14:13,228
ASHER:
LIKE THIS?
#STUFFCLARESAYS.

356
00:14:13,312 --> 00:14:14,980
CLARE:
WHAT?!

357
00:14:15,063 --> 00:14:16,940
IS THAT ABOUT YOU?

358
00:14:17,024 --> 00:14:18,567
UH... NO. UH, NO.
IT COULDN'T BE.

359
00:14:20,861 --> 00:14:21,904
ASHER:
AREN'T THEY ADDRESSED TO YOU?

360
00:14:21,987 --> 00:14:23,947
"WHY SETTLE FOR THAT

361
00:14:24,031 --> 00:14:25,866
WHEN WE CAN DO
SO MUCH BETTER?"

362
00:14:25,949 --> 00:14:27,451
#ASHERSAYS.

363
00:14:30,495 --> 00:14:31,622
ARE YOU SURE YOU WOULDN'T PREFER
TO REMAIN A LUDDITE?

364
00:14:31,705 --> 00:14:33,207
IT'S VERY PRINCIPLED.

365
00:14:34,208 --> 00:14:35,709
(PHONE BEEPS)

366
00:14:37,211 --> 00:14:39,087
I WILL FOR NOW.

367
00:14:39,171 --> 00:14:40,881
I GOTTA BE UPTOWN
IN TWENTY.

368
00:14:52,309 --> 00:14:53,769
MAX:
HEY, MALL WALKER!

369
00:14:53,852 --> 00:14:54,686
THIS IS LIKE
YOUR FIFTH LAP.

370
00:14:54,770 --> 00:14:55,521
SHOULDN'T YOU BE AT SCHOOL?

371
00:14:55,604 --> 00:14:57,356
UH, NO, I SKIPPED.

372
00:14:57,439 --> 00:14:59,274
DON'T EXACTLY FEEL LIKE
I BELONG THERE THESE DAYS.

373
00:14:59,358 --> 00:15:01,443
LIZ:
I SPENT SEVEN HUNDRED DOLLARS
ON THIS PHONE

374
00:15:01,527 --> 00:15:03,654
BECAUSE YOU SAID THAT I COULD
VIDEO CHAT WITH MY NIECE,

375
00:15:03,737 --> 00:15:05,614
AND IT DOESN'T WORK.

376
00:15:05,697 --> 00:15:08,408
AHEM!
DO YOU HAVE THE RIGHT APP?

377
00:15:08,492 --> 00:15:11,453
WHERE DO I GET
THE RIGHT APP?

378
00:15:11,537 --> 00:15:12,829
MAYBE THE PHONE'S
NOT THE PROBLEM.

379
00:15:12,913 --> 00:15:14,665
EITHER YOU GET ME
A MANAGER,

380
00:15:14,748 --> 00:15:15,624
OR YOU TAKE THIS
PIECE OF JUNK

381
00:15:15,707 --> 00:15:17,209
AND GIVE ME
MY MONEY BACK.

382
00:15:20,295 --> 00:15:22,506
WELL, THERE'S A WHOLE LOTTA
COMMISSION DOWN THE DRAIN.

383
00:15:22,589 --> 00:15:24,466
DREW:
MA'AM, IF YOU RETURN THIS,

384
00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:26,301
YOU'LL NEVER BE ABLE
TO VIDEO CHAT WITH YOUR NIECE.

385
00:15:26,385 --> 00:15:27,928
AND IF SHE LOOKS ANYTHING
LIKE YOU,

386
00:15:28,011 --> 00:15:29,596
I'M SURE SHE'S A CUTIE.

387
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,181
UH, MAY I SEE YOUR PHONE?

388
00:15:33,141 --> 00:15:34,393
(PHONE BEEPS)

389
00:15:34,476 --> 00:15:35,978
AH, THERE.

390
00:15:37,104 --> 00:15:38,772
TO TALK TO YOUR NIECE,

391
00:15:38,856 --> 00:15:40,399
YOU JUST PRESS THE PICTURE
OF THE VIDEO CAMERA

392
00:15:40,482 --> 00:15:41,984
RIGHT HERE.

393
00:15:42,067 --> 00:15:43,151
AND THEN TYPE HER
NUMBER IN.

394
00:15:43,235 --> 00:15:44,736
YEAH.

395
00:15:45,779 --> 00:15:48,073
THAT IS EASY!
THANK YOU.

396
00:15:48,156 --> 00:15:49,658
NO PROBLEM.

397
00:15:50,784 --> 00:15:52,286
(LAUGHS)

398
00:15:53,996 --> 00:15:55,289
DUDE,
THAT WAS AMAZING!

399
00:15:55,372 --> 00:15:57,165
I MOVED AN APP.

400
00:15:57,249 --> 00:16:00,127
YOU WERE HER HERO!
PLUS YOU SAVED MY COMMISSION.

401
00:16:00,210 --> 00:16:01,295
IS THERE ANY CHANCE
YOU'RE LOOKING FOR A JOB?

402
00:16:01,378 --> 00:16:02,504
I WASN'T THINKING
ABOUT IT.

403
00:16:02,588 --> 00:16:03,505
MAX:
START THINKING.

404
00:16:03,589 --> 00:16:05,007
YOU'VE GOT PEOPLE SMARTS,

405
00:16:05,090 --> 00:16:06,717
AND A SMILE THAT MAKES
THE LADIES MELT.

406
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,969
SERIOUSLY?

407
00:16:09,052 --> 00:16:11,680
YOU SHOULD FILL OUT
AN APPLICATION ONLINE.

408
00:16:16,602 --> 00:16:17,936
WHY DID YOU POST THOSE THINGS
TO TWITTER?

409
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:19,438
#STUFFCLARESAYS?
IT WAS A JOKE.

410
00:16:19,521 --> 00:16:20,522
IT WASN'T FUNNY.

411
00:16:20,606 --> 00:16:21,773
ADAM THOUGHT IT WAS.

412
00:16:21,857 --> 00:16:23,483
HE WAS JUST EGGING
YOU ON.

413
00:16:23,567 --> 00:16:24,860
YOU REALIZE WHAT YOU POSTED
WAS PUBLIC.

414
00:16:24,943 --> 00:16:26,445
ANYONE CAN READ IT.

415
00:16:26,528 --> 00:16:28,405
THAT WAS THE POINT.

416
00:16:28,488 --> 00:16:29,156
YOU WERE ACTING
SO FULL OF YOURSELF.

417
00:16:29,239 --> 00:16:30,991
BUT MY MENTOR SAW IT.

418
00:16:31,074 --> 00:16:32,784
DO YOU UNDERSTAND
HOW EMBARRASSING THAT WAS?

419
00:16:32,868 --> 00:16:33,911
I LOVE WORKING
WITH ASHER,

420
00:16:33,994 --> 00:16:35,120
AND I DON'T WANNA LOSE
THIS CO-OP

421
00:16:35,204 --> 00:16:36,622
JUST BECAUSE
YOU HAVE ASPERGERS.

422
00:16:36,705 --> 00:16:39,374
BECAUSE I HAVE ASPERGERS?

423
00:16:39,458 --> 00:16:40,459
DO YOU HEAR YOURSELF?

424
00:16:40,542 --> 00:16:42,878
DON'T OVERREACT.

425
00:16:42,961 --> 00:16:44,838
JUST PLEASE...
DELETE THE TWEETS.

426
00:16:49,009 --> 00:16:51,678
"DELETE THE TWEETS."
TWEET.

427
00:16:51,762 --> 00:16:53,305
STOP IT,
I'M BEGGING YOU.

428
00:16:53,388 --> 00:16:57,017
"STOP IT.
I'M BEGGING YOU." TWEET.

429
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:58,894
ANYTHING ELSE
YOU'D LIKE TO SAY?

430
00:17:07,110 --> 00:17:08,487
LUKE:
GOT IT.

431
00:17:08,570 --> 00:17:10,864
ELIZABETHAN ERA SPORTS,
LIKE SHUTTLECOCK.

432
00:17:10,948 --> 00:17:12,449
WATCH YOUR MOUTH!

433
00:17:13,867 --> 00:17:15,369
WHAT, THAT'S LIKE BADMINTON,
YOU SICKO.

434
00:17:17,287 --> 00:17:18,288
JENNA:
HOW ABOUT THE GLOBE THEATRE

435
00:17:18,372 --> 00:17:20,332
AND HOW IT REFLECTED
THE TIMES?

436
00:17:20,415 --> 00:17:22,084
STUDYING CLASS AND CULTURE
THROUGH THE THEATRE?

437
00:17:22,167 --> 00:17:24,086
MR. BAKER:
SOUNDS LIKE AN INSPIRED IDEA.

438
00:17:24,169 --> 00:17:25,546

OH, HEY, DAD.
THIS IS JENNA.

439
00:17:25,629 --> 00:17:26,672

OH, NICE TO MEET YOU.

440
00:17:26,755 --> 00:17:28,298
I'M OFF TO EVENING SERVICE.

441
00:17:28,382 --> 00:17:30,884
PLEASE DON'T BURN THE HOUSE DOWN
WHILE I'M OUT.

442
00:17:30,968 --> 00:17:32,094
LUKE:
WHOA! CHECK IT,

443
00:17:32,177 --> 00:17:33,387
LOWER CLASS PEOPLE
ONLY PAID A PENNY

444
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:34,972
AND THEY PUT IT
IN A BOX.

445
00:17:35,055 --> 00:17:36,807
THAT'S WHERE THE TERM
BOX OFFICE COMES FROM.

446
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:38,392
JENNA:
THANKS, FACTOID.

447

OH MY GOODNESS,

00:17:48,068 --> 00:17:50,529
JENNA, I'M SO SORRY.
THIS IS MY BFF FROM FLORIDA

452
00:17:50,612 --> 00:17:51,780
AND WE HAVEN'T TALKED
IN WEEKS!

453
00:17:51,864 --> 00:17:52,990
THIS COULD BE A LONG ONE.

454
00:17:53,073 --> 00:17:54,408
I DON'T MIND.

455
00:17:54,491 --> 00:17:57,077
I'LL SEE HER OUT.

456
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:58,829

GRAND CHAMPIONSHIPS?

KELLY: YEAH!

YEAH.

460
00:18:02,666 --> 00:18:04,042
SHE REMINDS ME OF ME.

461
00:18:04,126 --> 00:18:06,461
WELL, OLD ME.

462
00:18:06,545 --> 00:18:08,297
WHAT HAPPENED TO
SPARKPLUG JENNA?

463
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:10,966
LIFE.

464
00:18:11,049 --> 00:18:14,011
LET'S JUST SAY...
I KINDA LOST MY WAY.

465
00:18:14,094 --> 00:18:15,888
HOW IS BECKY SO POSITIVE
ALL THE TIME?

466
00:18:15,971 --> 00:18:17,472
BOTH OF YOU?

467
00:18:18,098 --> 00:18:20,309
FAITH.

468
00:18:20,392 --> 00:18:22,811
WE BELIEVE GOD
HAS A PATH FOR US,

469
00:18:22,895 --> 00:18:24,897
AND IF WE FOLLOW IT,

470
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:27,566
EVERYTHING WILL BE OKAY.

471
00:18:27,649 --> 00:18:29,026
YOU REALLY THINK THAT?

472
00:18:29,109 --> 00:18:30,611
OH, I KNOW IT.

473
00:18:32,404 --> 00:18:35,199
IT'S LIKE...
I FEEL MORE CONFIDENT

474
00:18:35,282 --> 00:18:37,117
KNOWING HE'S WATCHING OUT
FOR ME.

475
00:18:37,201 --> 00:18:38,243
I KNOW HE'S ALWAYS
GOT MY BACK,

476
00:18:38,327 --> 00:18:39,828
SO I'M NEVER ALONE.

477
00:18:41,371 --> 00:18:43,874
MUST BE NICE
TO HAVE A PATH,

478
00:18:43,957 --> 00:18:46,460
SOMEONE ALWAYS WATCHING
YOUR BACK.

479
00:18:46,543 --> 00:18:48,045
IT'S JUST... (SIGHS)

480
00:18:50,005 --> 00:18:54,134
HOW DO YOU BELIEVE IN SOMETHING
YOU CAN'T SEE?

481
00:18:54,218 --> 00:18:56,178
IT'S EASY.
YOU JUST... FEEL IT.

482
00:19:15,697 --> 00:19:18,367
DREW:
I HAVE NO PREVIOUS EXPERIENCE.

483
00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:19,826
LIE. EVERYONE'S HAD
A FAST FOOD JOB.

00:19:19,910 --> 00:19:21,328
JUST SAY YOU "EXCEL

THAT BETTER BE HOMEWORK.

UH, NO,
I'M APPLYING FOR A JOB.

489
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:33,632
YOU HAVE A JOB:
RECOVERING FROM A CONCUSSION.

490
00:19:33,715 --> 00:19:34,341
IT'S ONLY A COUPLE OF HOURS
AFTER SCHOOL.

491
00:19:34,424 --> 00:19:35,509
PLUS IT'S FUN.

492
00:19:35,592 --> 00:19:37,719
YOU'RE SICK RIGHT NOW.

493
00:19:37,803 --> 00:19:39,513
YOU NEED TUTORING
AND BRAIN EXERCISE,

494
00:19:39,596 --> 00:19:41,431
NOT A JOB.

495
00:19:41,515 --> 00:19:43,267
YOU GOTTA GET
YOUR GRADES UP!

496
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:44,893
NOT IF I DIDN'T HAVE SCHOOL.

497
00:19:46,770 --> 00:19:48,856
SO YOU'RE GONNA DROP OUT?

498
00:19:48,939 --> 00:19:50,440
FUNNY.

499
00:19:51,650 --> 00:19:52,693
MOM, I NEED THIS.

500
00:19:52,776 --> 00:19:54,820
YOU NEED TO GET BETTER.

501
00:19:54,903 --> 00:19:56,989
(SCOFFS)

502
00:19:57,072 --> 00:19:59,408
I'M SICK OF HER TREATING ME
LIKE SUCH A BABY.

(BELL RINGS)

504
00:20:04,413 --> 00:20:05,664
JENNA:
THEN HE SAID...

505
00:20:05,747 --> 00:20:09,543
GOD HAS A PATH FOR ALL OF US,
AND WE KISSED.

506
00:20:09,626 --> 00:20:11,128
ALLI:
J.M. IS BACK IN THE GAME!

507
00:20:11,211 --> 00:20:13,338
CAN I GET A WHAT WHAT?

508
00:20:13,422 --> 00:20:14,423
'KAY, YOU'VE BEEN HANGING
AROUND DAVE TOO MUCH.

509
00:20:14,506 --> 00:20:16,341
SORRY.

510
00:20:16,425 --> 00:20:17,885
SO DO YOU THINK
IT'S TRUE;

511
00:20:17,968 --> 00:20:20,596
THAT WE ALL HAVE A PATH
BECAUSE OF GOD?

512
00:20:20,679 --> 00:20:23,682
I BELIEVE WE'RE THE MASTERS
OF OUR OWN DESTINY.

513
00:20:23,765 --> 00:20:25,309
I HAVE THIS GOOD FEELING
IN MY TUMMY,

514
00:20:25,392 --> 00:20:26,894
LIKE I CAN TURN
MY LIFE AROUND

515
00:20:26,977 --> 00:20:29,605
AND FIND MY PLACE AGAIN.

516
00:20:29,688 --> 00:20:33,358
IS THIS GOOD FEELING
FOR GOD OR FOR LUKE?

517
00:20:33,442 --> 00:20:35,194
BOTH? MAYBE A LITTLE BIT
MORE LUKE;

00:20:35,277 --> 00:20:37,654

00:20:50,584 --> 00:20:52,044
JENNA,
LAST NIGHT WAS...

525
00:20:52,127 --> 00:20:53,629
WAS REALLY SOMETHING,
I KNOW.

526
00:20:55,297 --> 00:20:57,758
BUT WILL BECKY BE UPSET?

527
00:20:57,841 --> 00:20:59,384
NO. I THINK IT
WAS A MISTAKE.

528
00:21:00,219 --> 00:21:01,637
WHAT?

529
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:04,014
LOOK, YOU'RE SWEET,
AND CRAZY CUTE, BUT...

530
00:21:05,682 --> 00:21:07,184
YOU TEMPT ME.

531
00:21:08,769 --> 00:21:10,229
TEMPT YOU?

532
00:21:10,312 --> 00:21:11,813
YEAH.

533
00:21:12,523 --> 00:21:14,024
LIKE SEXUALLY?

534
00:21:14,483 --> 00:21:17,861
YEAH. IT'S NOT PART
OF GOD'S PATH.

535
00:21:17,945 --> 00:21:21,240
LUKE, NO ONE'S
HAVING SEX HERE.

536
00:21:21,323 --> 00:21:24,910
YOU ALREADY HAVE,
WHICH MEANS THAT WE COULD.

537
00:21:24,993 --> 00:21:27,955
MAYBE IT'D BE DIFFERENT
IF YOU WERE CHRISTIAN...

538
00:21:35,796 --> 00:21:37,297
(EXHALES)

539
00:21:41,802 --> 00:21:43,303
