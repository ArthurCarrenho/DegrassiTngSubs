SPLITS THE DEFENSE.

180
00:06:55,374 --> 00:06:57,084
HE'S IN ON A BREAKAWAY
ALL ALONE AGAINST KOSTAL.

181
00:06:57,167 --> 00:06:57,876
FAKES THE SHOT,
BRINGS IT TO HIS BACK HAND,

182
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:59,837
TOP SHELF!
GOAL!

183
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,839
AND THE CROWD GOES WILD!

184
00:07:01,922 --> 00:07:03,423
SAUN-DERS! SAUN-DERS!

185
00:07:04,508 --> 00:07:06,176

SAUN-DERS! SAUN-DERS!

187
00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:13,475
SO, UH, IS THE NET
NAMED JAMIE?

188
00:07:13,559 --> 00:07:15,060
(SNORTS SOFTLY)

189
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:17,020
YOU DON'T REALLY HAVE
A GIRLFRIEND BACK HOME,

190
00:07:17,104 --> 00:07:19,815
DO YOU?

191
00:07:19,898 --> 00:07:21,859
SO YOU JUST...
DIDN'T WANNA HANG WITH US.

192
00:07:21,942 --> 00:07:22,818
YOU KNOW
WE DON'T BITE.

193
00:07:22,901 --> 00:07:24,570
NO, UM...

194
00:07:24,653 --> 00:07:26,280
YOU GUYS JUST KINDA
MAKE FUN OF ME.

195
00:07:26,363 --> 00:07:28,156
'CAUSE WE LIKE YOU.

196
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:28,824
WHY DON'T YOU COME
HANG WITH US

197
00:07:28,907 --> 00:07:29,867
AT THE MALL TOMORROW,

198
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:32,411
PICK UP SOME CHICKS.

199
00:07:32,494 --> 00:07:34,288
WELL, THAT'S THE NIGHT
BEFORE A GAME.

200
00:07:34,371 --> 00:07:36,915
SO?
YOU NEED TO RELAX!

201
00:07:36,999 --> 00:07:38,250
LOOK, I KNOW I WEAR
THE BIG C,

202
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:40,127
BUT YOU'RE SUPPOSED
TO BE THE STAR.

203
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:42,713
THE BOYS NEED TO SEE
THE REAL YOU.

204
00:07:42,796 --> 00:07:44,840
NO EXCUSES, ROOK,
YOU'RE COMING.

205
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:50,971
YEAH, OKAY.

206
00:07:55,058 --> 00:07:56,935
JAKE:
WHAT ABOUT A SOLAR-BASED
WATER-HEATING SYSTEM?

207
00:07:57,019 --> 00:07:58,770
FOR A WOMEN'S SHOE STORE?
THEY HAVE LIKE ONE SINK.

208
00:07:58,854 --> 00:08:00,397
EVERY LITTLE BIT HELPS!

209
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,566
THESE ARE PRETTY LOFTY IDEAS,
PAL,

210
00:08:02,649 --> 00:08:04,234
ESPECIALLY SINCE WE HAVE ZERO
EXPERIENCE WITH GREEN DESIGN.

211
00:08:04,318 --> 00:08:05,819
YEAH, BUT, DAD...

212
00:08:07,196 --> 00:08:10,032
I'VE BEEN RESEARCHING.

213
00:08:10,115 --> 00:08:11,450
I'LL BE HERE ALL DAY
IF I HAVE TO.

214
00:08:11,533 --> 00:08:13,410
MARTIN AND MARTIN CONSTRUCTION
NEEDS TO GO GREEN!

215
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:15,162
WHOA! IT'S STILL JUST
MARTIN'S CONSTRUCTION, OKAY?

216
00:08:15,245 --> 00:08:16,413
THIS MARTIN.
YOU CAN'T BE HERE ALL DAY,

217
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:18,081
YOU HAVE CLASSES,
REMEMBER?

218
00:08:18,165 --> 00:08:19,291
YEAH, BUT YOU SAID SO
YOURSELF -

219
00:08:19,374 --> 00:08:20,918
THE MOST IMPORTANT LEARNING
HAPPENS ON THE JOB.

220
00:08:21,001 --> 00:08:23,170
YEAH, AFTER YOU'VE
FINISHED SCHOOL.

221
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:26,381

HEY, DAD!

222
00:08:26,465 --> 00:08:28,342

JAKE, IT'S SETTLED.

223
00:08:28,425 --> 00:08:29,801
I'M DOIN' THIS ONE ON MY OWN.
ARE WE CLEAR?

224
00:08:29,885 --> 00:08:31,512
YEAH, LOUD AND CLEAR,
BUT...

225
00:08:31,595 --> 00:08:33,096
THIS... GOES IN HERE.

226
00:08:34,765 --> 00:08:36,141

227
00:08:36,225 --> 00:08:38,602
(CHUCKLES)
GEEZ, PAL,

228
00:08:38,685 --> 00:08:40,812
WHEN DID YOU BECOME SUCH
A LITTLE TREE-HUGGER, HUH?

229
00:08:44,650 --> 00:08:47,236
ALLI:
AND THEN I EXPOSE
THE SENSOR COMPOUND

230
00:08:47,319 --> 00:08:49,780
TO THE CANCER COMPOUND
FOUND IN BREATH,

231
00:08:49,863 --> 00:08:51,365
AND MEASURE THE REACTION.

232
00:08:53,158 --> 00:08:56,036
SEE, I BELIEVE I'M ON A PATH
TO DISCOVERING A COMPOUND

233
00:08:56,119 --> 00:08:57,871
THAT CAN MEASURE
FOR TRACES OF BREAST CANCER

234
00:08:57,955 --> 00:08:59,414
FOUND IN A PERSON'S BREATH

235
00:08:59,498 --> 00:09:02,042

MAY I ASK A COUPLE QUESTIONS?

238
00:09:06,922 --> 00:09:08,131
UM, SURE.

239
00:09:08,215 --> 00:09:09,383
HOW DO YOU HAVE ACCESS

240
00:09:09,466 --> 00:09:10,509
TO THE CANCEROUS
BREATH COMPOUND

241
00:09:10,592 --> 00:09:12,094
NECESSARY TO RUN
YOUR TESTS?

242
00:09:12,177 --> 00:09:13,470
WELL,
THROUGH A LOT OF RESEARCH,

243
00:09:13,554 --> 00:09:14,972
I LEARNED HOW TO MAKE IT

244
00:09:15,055 --> 00:09:17,683
AND I MANUFACTURE IT
RIGHT HERE IN THE LAB.

245
00:09:19,810 --> 00:09:21,937
LEA:
AND THE SENSOR COMPOUNDS?

246
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:22,813
I'M WORKING THROUGH
A SERIES OF COMPOUNDS

247
00:09:22,896 --> 00:09:24,314
USING TRANSITION METALS.

248
00:09:24,398 --> 00:09:25,691
YOU CAN'T POSSIBLY BE
MAKING THOSE HERE.

249
00:09:25,774 --> 00:09:26,942
(CHUCKLES)
NO.

250
00:09:27,025 --> 00:09:27,693
MY SCIENCE TEACHER,
MRS. COHEN,

251
00:09:27,776 --> 00:09:29,862
ORDERS THEM FOR ME.

252
00:09:29,945 --> 00:09:31,405
SO I SAVE UP
AND BUY SMALL AMOUNTS

253
00:09:31,488 --> 00:09:32,698
OF TWO AT A TIME.

254
00:09:32,781 --> 00:09:34,783
IT'S IMPRESSIVE.

255

(SIGHS)
WELL...

256
00:09:37,286 --> 00:09:39,454
I HAVEN'T EXACTLY ACHIEVED
THE ACCURACY I'M HOPING FOR,

257
00:09:39,538 --> 00:09:42,499
BUT I THINK I'M CLOSE.

258
00:09:42,583 --> 00:09:44,960
I JUST NEED TO SAVE UP
FOR THE NEXT BATCH.

259
00:09:48,213 --> 00:09:50,465
SHE'S MORE AMBITIOUS
THAN YOU SAID.

260
00:09:50,549 --> 00:09:52,926
SHE REMINDS ME OF YOU
WHEN YOU WENT HERE, ACTUALLY.

261
00:09:55,262 --> 00:09:57,681
(LEA CLEARS HER THROAT,

262
00:09:57,764 --> 00:10:00,350
ONE MORE QUESTION.

263
00:10:00,434 --> 00:10:04,396
ALLI:
AND THEN SHE OFFERED ME
A FULL SCHOLARSHIP TO M.I.T. -

264
00:10:04,479 --> 00:10:06,064
AS ONE OF ONLY TWO UNDERGRADS
IN HER LAB -

265
00:10:06,148 --> 00:10:08,275
TO BEAT BREAST CANCER!

266
00:10:08,358 --> 00:10:10,819
MRS. BHANDARI:
M.I.T.? THE M.I.T.?

267
00:10:10,903 --> 00:10:12,154
MR. BHANDARI:
AS A RESEARCH STUDENT,
NOT A RESEARCH SUBJECT, RIGHT?

268
00:10:12,237 --> 00:10:12,738
SHE WAS CLEAR ON THIS?

269
00:10:12,821 --> 00:10:14,698
YES!

270
00:10:14,781 --> 00:10:17,034

(LAUGHS)

271
00:10:17,117 --> 00:10:20,037
ALLI:
UH, EASY.
I HAVEN'T EXACTLY ACCEPTED YET.

272
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,622
WHY NOT?!

273
00:10:22,206 --> 00:10:23,749
I DON'T KNOW.

274
00:10:23,832 --> 00:10:24,917
I THOUGHT MAYBE
WE SHOULD TALK ABOUT IT.

275
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,835
I'LL BE SO FAR AWAY
SO SOON.

276
00:10:26,919 --> 00:10:29,505
THAT'S WHY STEVE JOBS
GAVE US FACETIME!

277
00:10:29,588 --> 00:10:30,589

"MY SON IS A DOCTOR."

279
00:10:32,341 --> 00:10:34,009
WELL, MY DAUGHTER
IS CURING CANCER!

280
00:10:36,053 --> 00:10:37,387

BOY-CRAZY YEARS

281
00:10:37,471 --> 00:10:39,598
AND RUNNING AWAY,

282
00:10:39,681 --> 00:10:43,018
YOU HAVE BECOME
SUCH A BEAUTIFUL YOUNG WOMAN.

00:10:43,101 --> 00:10:45,020

290
00:11:07,251 --> 00:11:09,878
THEN WHY AM I ONLY TAKING
MONDAY'S BIRTH CONTROL PILL NOW?

291
00:11:10,462 --> 00:11:11,964
OH, UH...

292
00:11:13,549 --> 00:11:15,300
OKAY, JUST TAKE THREE
AND BE CAREFUL FROM NOW ON.

293
00:11:15,384 --> 00:11:16,593
BUT IT'S NO BIGGIE.

294
00:11:16,677 --> 00:11:17,928
UH, YES, BIGGIE.

295
00:11:18,011 --> 00:11:19,096

00:13:34,481 --> 00:13:36,441
MOM?! OH!

353
00:13:36,525 --> 00:13:38,151
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HOME?

354
00:13:38,235 --> 00:13:39,903
I COULD ASK YOU
THE SAME THING.

355
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:45,784
THAT'S NOT MINE.

356
00:13:45,868 --> 00:13:47,452
I FORGOT SOMETHING
FOR CLASS

357
00:13:47,536 --> 00:13:50,247
AND THEN I CAME HOME
AND FOUND IT.

358
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:51,832
IT MUST BE JENNA'S.

359
00:13:51,915 --> 00:13:53,417
(GASPS)
OH, JENNA.

360
00:13:55,043 --> 00:13:56,253
SHE'LL BE ON
THE BUSINESS END

361
00:13:56,336 --> 00:13:57,629
OF A STERN TALKING-TO

362
00:13:57,713 --> 00:13:59,131
IS THAT REALLY NECESSARY?

363
00:13:59,214 --> 00:14:01,300
I MEAN,
SHE'S PRACTICALLY AN ADULT.

364
00:14:01,383 --> 00:14:02,718
NOT ACCORDING TO
THE PARENTAL CONSENT FORMS

365
00:14:02,801 --> 00:14:04,887
I SIGN ON HER BEHALF.

366
00:14:04,970 --> 00:14:06,972
BUT IS IT REALLY
THAT BIG A DEAL?

367
00:14:07,055 --> 00:14:09,808
IT'S A PREGNANCY TEST!
IT'S AN ENORMOUS DEAL!

369
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:13,437
AND JENNA HAS ALREADY
GIVEN UP ONE BABY!

370
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:15,355
IS SHE TRYING
TO RUIN HER LIFE?!

371
00:14:17,065 --> 00:14:18,567

OVER THAT TABLE,
INTO THAT LADY'S PURSE,

379
00:14:40,005 --> 00:14:41,423
OFF HER BACK.

380
00:14:41,507 --> 00:14:43,008
NO WAY.

381
00:14:45,636 --> 00:14:46,678

BETWEEN IT AND HOCKEY.

I GUESS I'VE JUST ALWAYS BEEN
TOO BUSY WITH HOCKEY.

OF BEING SO GOOD

WE KNEW YOU HAD A BABY
WHEN YOU CAME HERE,

405

00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,627
YOU CAN TELL.
(STRESSED EXHALE)

528
00:20:55,631 --> 00:20:57,508
IF YOU'RE WORRIED ABOUT THIS
WHOLE FAST-TRACKING THING...

529
00:20:57,591 --> 00:20:59,092
I'M WORRIED THAT...

530
00:21:01,470 --> 00:21:02,763
I'M PREGNANT.

531
00:21:02,846 --> 00:21:04,515
WHAT?!

532
00:21:04,598 --> 00:21:05,224
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO,
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

533
00:21:05,307 --> 00:21:07,017
ALL SIGNS POINT TO YES.

534
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:08,143
I MEAN, YOU SAID I DIDN'T
NEED TO USE A CONDOM!

535
00:21:08,227 --> 00:21:10,020
I KNOW.
THIS IS ALL MY FAULT!

536
00:21:12,898 --> 00:21:14,525
BUT WE CAN HANDLE IT,
RIGHT?

537
00:21:14,608 --> 00:21:15,651
WE CAN GET THROUGH
ANYTHING TOGETHER.

538
00:21:15,734 --> 00:21:16,652
REMEMBER?
YOU SAID-!

539
00:21:16,735 --> 00:21:18,237
HOW?!
I DON'T KNOW!

540
00:21:21,532 --> 00:21:23,033
I DON'T KNOW.

541
00:21:26,036 --> 00:21:28,413
WELL, I GUESS THIS MEANS
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO M.I.T.

542
00:21:35,587 --> 00:21:37,089
(THROWS UP,
COUGHS)

543
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:45,180
(EXHALES SHAKILY)
