00:00:17,351 --> 00:00:19,853
MR. BHANDARI:
IT WAS MY IDEA.

00:00:19,937 --> 00:00:22,481
MRS. BHANDARI:
YES, BUT I WAS THE ONE
WHO MADE IT HAPPEN.

6
00:00:22,564 --> 00:00:24,358
MOM, DAD,
I DON'T MEAN TO BE RUDE,

00:00:38,747 --> 00:00:41,083
WE WANTED TO MAKE HER LIFE

00:14:02,634 --> 00:14:03,844
(GASPS) EW! WAS THAT
WHAT YOU GUYS WERE DOING?!

350
00:14:03,927 --> 00:14:05,679
DREW:
UH... NO.

351
00:14:05,762 --> 00:14:07,848
THE OTHER THING
WE DISCUSSED...

352
00:14:07,931 --> 00:14:09,474
IX-NAY ON THE MOM TALK-AY?

353
00:14:09,558 --> 00:14:11,435
THAT'S NOT PIG LATIN.

354
00:14:11,518 --> 00:14:13,520
THAT WASN'T ANYTHING
LATIN.

355
00:14:13,604 --> 00:14:16,064
(SIGHS,
SHUTS OFF THE TV)

356
00:14:16,148 --> 00:14:17,900
SO IT'S COOL THAT I DON'T
HAVE A RELATIONSHIP

357
00:14:17,983 --> 00:14:19,484
WITH MY GIRLFRIEND'S MOM,
RIGHT?

358
00:14:19,568 --> 00:14:20,986
WELL, B DOESN'T HAVE ONE
WITH MINE ANYMORE;

359
00:14:21,069 --> 00:14:23,071
THAT'S WORKING GREAT.

360
00:14:23,155 --> 00:14:24,990
ACTUALLY,
IT KINDA SUCKS.

361
00:14:25,073 --> 00:14:26,867
NEWS TO ME.

362
00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:28,368
ADMIT IT,
IT WAS EASIER

363
00:14:28,452 --> 00:14:30,037
WHEN YOUR MOM AND I
WERE FRIENDLY.

364
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:30,871
UH, YEAH, MAYBE.

365
00:14:30,954 --> 00:14:32,915
DEFINITELY.

366
00:14:32,998 --> 00:14:34,875
WHENEVER I NEEDED HELP,
YOUR MOM WAS THERE.

367
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:36,627
PLUS THERE WERE
ALL THE FAMILY EVENTS:

368
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:37,961
SUNDAY NIGHT DINNER,
GAMES NIGHTS...

369
00:14:38,045 --> 00:14:40,339
I LOVE BOARD GAMES.

370
00:14:40,422 --> 00:14:42,216
AUDRA WAS LIKE
A SUBSTITUTE MOM.

371
00:14:42,299 --> 00:14:44,343
DREW:
SERIOUSLY?

372
00:14:44,426 --> 00:14:46,094
I BET SHE GAVE
GREAT ADVICE, TOO.

373
00:14:47,095 --> 00:14:48,597
SHE REALLY DID.

374
00:14:51,266 --> 00:14:53,310
ALL RIGHT,
IT'S SETTLED.

375
00:14:53,393 --> 00:14:55,979
I NEED TO HAVE A RELATIONSHIP
WITH IMOGEN'S MOM.

376
00:14:56,063 --> 00:14:58,023
I HAVE TO FIX THINGS
WITH NATALIE!

377
00:14:59,608 --> 00:15:01,151
(LAUGHING)

378
00:15:01,235 --> 00:15:01,985
(SARCASTICALLY)
THANK YOU!

379
00:15:02,069 --> 00:15:03,570
THANK YOU.

380
00:15:05,614 --> 00:15:07,658
(SIGHS)
WELL, THIS WAS FUN.

381
00:15:07,741 --> 00:15:09,076
THAT SOUNDS LIKE
LEAVING TALK.

382
00:15:09,159 --> 00:15:10,536
YEAH, WELL, I SHOULD'VE
BEEN HOME HOURS AGO.

383
00:15:10,619 --> 00:15:12,621
YOU GOT SOME
CRAZY CURFEW?

384
00:15:12,704 --> 00:15:16,124
NO, I HAVE A CRAZY AMOUNT
OF HOMEWORK TO DO.

385
00:15:16,208 --> 00:15:18,335
I'M FAST-TRACKING

386
00:15:18,418 --> 00:15:21,004
CUZ I GOT INTO THIS
SPECIAL PROGRAM AT M.I.T.

387
00:15:21,088 --> 00:15:22,881
I'M SLOW-TRACKING.

388
00:15:22,965 --> 00:15:23,882
I'M GONNA TAKE A VICTORY LAP,
MAYBE TWO.

389
00:15:23,966 --> 00:15:25,217
MUST BE NICE.

390
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:26,844
DALLAS:
IT IS!

391
00:15:26,927 --> 00:15:28,053
HIGH SCHOOL'S AS GOOD
AS IT GETS.

392
00:15:28,136 --> 00:15:29,847
WHY RUSH IT,
BHANDARI!

393
00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:32,015
I DID IT YOUR WAY ONCE.

394
00:15:32,099 --> 00:15:33,183
WENT AND GOT MYSELF
HOOKED ON THESE PILLS

395
00:15:33,267 --> 00:15:35,811
TO KEEP MYSELF AWAKE
'CAUSE I WAS SO BUSY.

396
00:15:35,894 --> 00:15:38,021
WELL,
CAN YOU HOOK ME UP?

397
00:15:38,105 --> 00:15:39,648
DALLAS:
YOU DON'T NEED PILLS,
BHANDARI.

398
00:15:39,731 --> 00:15:42,109
WHAT YOU NEED
IS A BALANCE.

399
00:15:42,192 --> 00:15:44,611
YOU KNOW,
SO YOU DON'T GO INSANE.

400
00:15:44,695 --> 00:15:46,947

TUTORING WORKSHEETS

426
00:16:44,963 --> 00:16:46,840
GOD, MY HISTORY PROJECT!

427
00:16:46,924 --> 00:16:48,550
I SHOULD'VE NEVER TAKEN
A NIGHT OFF.

428
00:16:48,634 --> 00:16:50,385
I GUESS YOUR DATE WENT WELL
WITH DAVE?

429

ACTUALLY,
QUITE THE OPPOSITE.

YOU'RE INTO HIM NOW?

435
00:17:01,605 --> 00:17:03,232
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

436
00:17:03,315 --> 00:17:04,483
I DON'T HAVE TIME
TO BE INTO ANYBODY,

437
00:17:04,566 --> 00:17:06,485
ESPECIALLY
IF I FALL ASLEEP

438
00:17:06,568 --> 00:17:08,695
INSTEAD OF DOING
A HISTORY PROJECT!

439
00:17:08,779 --> 00:17:09,905
MAYBE PERINO WILL GIVE YOU
AN EXTENSION?

440
00:17:09,988 --> 00:17:11,490
HAVE YOU MET PERINO?

FIONA:
HI, I'M LOOKING
FOR DOCTOR GRANGER.

443
00:17:23,627 --> 00:17:25,754
NATALIE:
FIONA?

444
00:17:25,838 --> 00:17:26,839
LOOK, I KNOW THAT
YOU DON'T LIKE

445
00:17:26,922 --> 00:17:28,882
MY LIFE SITUATION,

446
00:17:28,966 --> 00:17:31,343
BUT I WANT YOU TO KNOW
THAT I'M NOT A BAD PERSON.

447
00:17:31,426 --> 00:17:33,303
I WASN'T TRYING
TO JUDGE, FIONA.

448
00:17:33,387 --> 00:17:35,889
I WAS ONLY TRYING
TO BE A GOOD MOM.

449
00:17:35,973 --> 00:17:37,641
(SIGHS) I KNOW,
I GET THAT.

450
00:17:37,724 --> 00:17:40,269
I'M SURE MY MOM WOULD'VE
FELT THE SAME WAY.

451
00:17:40,352 --> 00:17:43,397
BUT IMOGEN AND I ARE
A GOOD FIT,

452
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:45,691
AND I'D REALLY LIKE
ANOTHER CHANCE TO SHOW YOU.

453
00:17:45,774 --> 00:17:47,359

454
00:17:47,442 --> 00:17:47,985

00:17:57,786 --> 00:17:58,954
OKAY, GIVE ME
YOUR CELL PHONE NUMBER.

459

WHEN THINGS CLEAR UP,

460
00:18:00,747 --> 00:18:03,208
YOU AND IMOGEN AND I
CAN ALL GO SHOPPING.

461
00:18:03,292 --> 00:18:05,878
IT'D BE A GREAT WAY
FOR US ALL TO BOND.

462
00:18:05,961 --> 00:18:09,381
UH, IMOGEN LIKES SHOPPING,
RIGHT?

463
00:18:09,464 --> 00:18:11,425
ARE YOU KIDDING?
(LAUGHS)

464
00:18:11,508 --> 00:18:14,261
SHE'D SLEEP AT THE MALL

HEY, TRIS!

466
00:18:18,015 --> 00:18:20,642
HOW ARE YOU
FEELING TODAY?

467
00:18:20,726 --> 00:18:22,603
I SPENT ALL NIGHT OBSESSING
ABOUT YOUR DIET ADVICE.

468
00:18:22,686 --> 00:18:24,354
I'M SO SORRY.

469
00:18:24,438 --> 00:18:26,023
DON'T BE.

THE MAGICAL CLEANSE!

472
00:18:29,985 --> 00:18:30,402
MAYA:
A CLEANSE?
THAT'S A TERRIBLE IDEA!

473
00:18:30,485 --> 00:18:32,571
I'M TOTALLY IN.

474
00:18:32,654 --> 00:18:33,530
MAYA:
GUYS, THESE CRASH DIETS
ARE SO NOT HEALTHY.

475
00:18:33,614 --> 00:18:35,782
FIRST OF ALL,

476
00:18:35,866 --> 00:18:37,284
IT'S NOT A DIET,
IT'S A CLEANSE.

477
00:18:37,367 --> 00:18:38,911
SECOND OF ALL,

478
00:18:38,994 --> 00:18:40,329
CELEBS DO IT
ALL THE TIME.

479
00:18:40,412 --> 00:18:42,497
OH, CELEBRITIES DO IT.
THEN IT MUST BE HEALTHY.

MAYA, YOU'RE A STICK.

I DON'T EXPECT YOU
TO UNDERSTAND.

482
00:18:46,335 --> 00:18:47,878
THERE ARE SAFER WAYS
TO GET IN SHAPE -

483
00:18:47,961 --> 00:18:49,880
EXERCISE,
EATING RIGHT...

484
00:18:49,963 --> 00:18:51,256
TRISTAN:
THAT SOUNDS SLOW AND HARD.

485
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:54,051
THIS CLEANSE IS FAST
AND EASY.

486
00:18:54,134 --> 00:18:55,219
I'LL LOSE WEIGHT.
FAB WILL LIKE ME.

487
00:18:55,302 --> 00:18:57,012
ELI WILL CAST ME.

488
00:18:57,095 --> 00:18:59,306
EVERYTHING WILL BE SUNSHINE
AND UNICORNS.

EAGER TO HAND IN YOUR
ASSIGNMENT, MS. BHANDARI?

494
00:19:13,028 --> 00:19:16,156
UM, ACTUALLY, I WAS HOPING
FOR AN EXTENSION.

495
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:17,574
I'M NOT IN THE HABIT
OF GRANTING EXTENSIONS

496
00:19:17,658 --> 00:19:19,243
TO PEOPLE WHO ALMOST
RUN ME OVER.

497
00:19:19,326 --> 00:19:20,702
I HAVE SO MUCH
ON MY PLATE.

498
00:19:20,786 --> 00:19:22,120
I JUST NEED
A FEW EXTRA DAYS.

499
00:19:22,204 --> 00:19:23,705
DAYS? PLURAL?

500
00:19:24,831 --> 00:19:26,333
I'LL GIVE YOU ONE DAY
AT MOST.

501
00:19:26,416 --> 00:19:28,418
I HAVE NEVER ASKED YOU
FOR AN EXTENSION EVER.

502
00:19:28,502 --> 00:19:30,879
WHICH IS THE ONLY REASON
I'M GIVING YOU THE DAY.

I'LL NEVER GET THAT
ASSIGNMENT DONE IN TIME.

507
00:19:41,598 --> 00:19:43,809
I NEED MORE HOURS
IN THE DAY.

508
00:19:43,892 --> 00:19:45,853

NOW, ALL WE'RE GONNA CONSUME

00:20:33,358 --> 00:20:35,819
MAYBE THIS ISN'T
SUCH A GOOD IDEA, TRIS.

521
00:20:35,903 --> 00:20:39,114
LIKE WHO CARES ABOUT ELI'S
STUPID ZOMBIE MOVIE?

522
00:20:39,198 --> 00:20:40,699
THIS ISN'T JUST ABOUT
THE MOVIE.

523
00:20:43,535 --> 00:20:44,620
I WANT LOVE!

524
00:20:44,703 --> 00:20:48,290
AND YOU THINK YOU NEED
TO LOSE WEIGHT TO FIND IT?

525
00:20:48,373 --> 00:20:51,043
IF I DON'T LIKE MYSELF,
HOW CAN ANYBODY LIKE ME?

526
00:20:53,003 --> 00:20:54,505
LOOK, I'M DOING
THIS CLEANSE,

527
00:20:54,963 --> 00:20:56,465
WITH OR WITHOUT YOU.

528
00:20:58,550 --> 00:21:00,302
OKAY.
LET'S DO IT.
(HAPPY SIGH)

529
00:21:04,348 --> 00:21:06,391
DEGRASSI'S FAVOURITE
FAST-TRACKER.

530
00:21:07,559 --> 00:21:09,061
WHAT'S UP?

531
00:21:10,395 --> 00:21:12,314
THIS A...
THIS A BOOTY CALL?

532
00:21:12,397 --> 00:21:14,691
ALLI:
NO!

533
00:21:14,775 --> 00:21:17,611
BUT I WAS THINKING
ABOUT LAST NIGHT...

534
00:21:17,694 --> 00:21:19,696
AND ABOUT THE PILLS
YOU MENTIONED.

535
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:21,823
(SIGHS) YOU DO NOT
WANNA GO THERE.

536
00:21:21,907 --> 00:21:24,117
YES, I DO.

537
00:21:24,201 --> 00:21:24,993
LAST NIGHT CREATED
THIS HUGE BACKLOG

538
00:21:25,077 --> 00:21:26,245
OF WORK I DIDN'T DO

539
00:21:26,328 --> 00:21:27,788
AND THE ONLY WAY
TO CATCH UP

540
00:21:27,871 --> 00:21:28,413
IS TO FIND MORE HOURS
IN THE DAY.

541
00:21:28,497 --> 00:21:30,165
NO, BHANDARI.

542
00:21:30,249 --> 00:21:31,834
I TOLD YOU HOW MUCH
THOSE PILLS MESSED ME UP.

543
00:21:31,917 --> 00:21:34,044
I ONLY NEED THE PILLS
FOR A FEW DAYS.

544
00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:36,672
I'LL OWE YOU.

545
00:21:38,674 --> 00:21:40,175
OKAY.

546
00:21:41,093 --> 00:21:43,053
I KNOW A GUY.

547
00:21:43,136 --> 00:21:44,638
(RELIEVED EXHALE)
