00:17:38,183 --> 00:17:39,685
THIS IS SO STUPID.

356
00:17:44,648 --> 00:17:46,733
THIS IS SO... STUPID!

357
00:17:49,862 --> 00:17:52,197
CAM DOESN'T DESERVE
A CANDLELIGHT VIGIL.

358
00:17:52,281 --> 00:17:54,575
HE MADE A CHOICE!

359
00:17:54,658 --> 00:17:56,743
IT WAS THE WRONG ONE,

360
00:17:56,827 --> 00:17:58,620
BUT US STANDING HERE,

361
00:18:01,331 --> 00:18:03,876
FEELING SAD LIKE THIS,

362
00:18:03,959 --> 00:18:06,295
EVERYONE BLAMING THEMSELVES,
FEELING GUILTY,

IT'S NO ONE'S FAULT!

364
00:18:09,256 --> 00:18:10,257
I MEAN, IT'S HIS FAULT!

365
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:11,842
MAYA, HE WAS SICK.

366
00:18:13,677 --> 00:18:14,386
WELL, HE SHOULD'VE FOUGHT.

367
00:18:14,469 --> 00:18:16,346
HE WAS REALLY SICK.

368
00:18:16,430 --> 00:18:18,807
HE SHOULD'VE FOUGHT HARDER,
OR FOUND SOMEONE TO HELP!

369
00:18:18,891 --> 00:18:20,767
I WOULD'VE HELPED HIM,

370
00:18:20,851 --> 00:18:22,477
BUT HE DIDN'T GIVE ME
THE CHANCE!

371
00:18:22,561 --> 00:18:24,271
CAM HAD SO MANY REASONS
TO STAY,

372
00:18:24,354 --> 00:18:25,397
BUT INSTEAD,
HE JUST CHECKED OUT.

373
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:26,982
WELL, FINE!

374
00:18:30,485 --> 00:18:32,988
BUT I'M NOT LIGHTING
ANY CANDLES,

375
00:18:33,071 --> 00:18:34,573
