00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:56,530
EVERYBODY DESERVES
A SECOND CHANCE.

512
00:19:58,448 --> 00:19:59,950
SHE'S RIGHT.

513
00:20:01,285 --> 00:20:02,786
YOU'RE A GOOD KID,
KC.

514
00:20:06,707 --> 00:20:07,583
KC:
YOU FREAKED ME OUT!
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME?

515
00:20:07,666 --> 00:20:10,043
AND RUIN THE SURPRISE?

516
00:20:10,127 --> 00:20:11,628
KEVIN:
TIME FOR A TOAST.

517
00:20:13,130 --> 00:20:16,508
THAT'S ALCOHOLIC?

518
00:20:16,592 --> 00:20:19,428
KEVIN:
I KNOW YOU'RE UNDERAGE.
DON'T WORRY, I WON'T SNITCH.

519
00:20:19,511 --> 00:20:20,846
YOU'RE DRINKING AGAIN?

520
00:20:20,929 --> 00:20:22,264
KEVIN:
LOOSEN UP, BUD!

521
00:20:22,347 --> 00:20:22,764
A FEW GLASSES
AREN'T GONNA HURT ANYONE!

522
00:20:22,848 --> 00:20:24,808
A FEW?

523
00:20:24,892 --> 00:20:25,726
KEVIN:
WELL, WE HAD A HEAD START.

524
00:20:25,809 --> 00:20:26,435
LISA:
IT'S OKAY, KC.

525
00:20:26,518 --> 00:20:28,353
NO, IT'S NOT!

526
00:20:28,437 --> 00:20:30,564
YOU PROMISED NO DRUGS,
NO ALCOHOL.

527
00:20:30,647 --> 00:20:32,441
I KNOW, I KNOW,
BUT-

528
00:20:32,524 --> 00:20:34,109
KC:
THIS IS ALL BECAUSE OF HIM.

529
00:20:34,193 --> 00:20:36,153
(LAUGHS)
MY RESPONSIBLE SON!

530
00:20:36,236 --> 00:20:37,696
LIFE'S TOO SHORT
TO SWEAT THE SMALL STUFF.

531
00:20:37,779 --> 00:20:39,740
IT'S TIME TO CELEBRATE.

532
00:20:39,823 --> 00:20:41,325
ALL RIGHT? SIT.

533
00:20:46,830 --> 00:20:48,373
(PADS THUNK
AS CAM SLAPS THEM DOWN)

534
00:20:52,669 --> 00:20:54,171
NOT VERY FUN,
WAS IT?

535
00:20:55,797 --> 00:20:56,882
JUST REMEMBER THIS
NEXT TIME

536
00:20:56,965 --> 00:20:59,092
YOU THINK ABOUT BAILING
ON THE TEAM.

537
00:20:59,176 --> 00:21:01,428
LIKE IT OR NOT,
WE'RE ALL YOU HAVE.

538
00:21:03,013 --> 00:21:04,515
HERE. HYDRATE.

539
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:16,443
(PAD THUNKS HARD
AGAINST THE WALL)

540
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:40,300
(SLIGHTLY PANICKED BREATHS)

541
00:21:46,223 --> 00:21:47,975
(CRYING)
