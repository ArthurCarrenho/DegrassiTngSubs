THEY WERE ONLY GOING

21
00:00:40,541 --> 00:00:42,084

"HOW ABOUT LUCKY SEVEN?"

22

42
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:17,160
BECAUSE OF
THE TRANSGENDER THING?

43
00:01:17,244 --> 00:01:18,954
ADAM'S A BOY.

44
00:01:19,037 --> 00:01:20,080
I WOULDN'T HAVE FEELINGS
FOR HIM IF HE WEREN'T.

45
00:01:20,163 --> 00:01:21,498
THEN WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?

46
00:01:21,582 --> 00:01:23,792
HE ALREADY ASKED ME OUT
AND I BLEW IT.

47
00:01:23,876 --> 00:01:25,586
HOW DO I GET HIM
TO ASK AGAIN?

48
00:01:25,669 --> 00:01:27,171

THE ASKING.

A RELATIONSHIP WITH HIS MOM,

BUT I DO.

111
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:45,517
AND IF WE GET MARRIED
WITHOUT TELLING HER,

112
00:03:45,601 --> 00:03:47,644
IT COULD WRECK THAT.

00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:05,407
AND FINALLY, WHAT'S YOUR STANCE
ON FILM VERSUS DIGITAL?

179
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:07,034
DIGITAL'S CHEAPER,

180
00:06:07,117 --> 00:06:08,327
BUT FILM HAS
AN ATMOSPHERIC QUALITY-

181
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:10,412
YEAH, NO, LOOK...

182
00:06:10,495 --> 00:06:14,291
NONE OF THIS TECH STUFF MATTERS
UNLESS YOU GOT A GOOD STORY.

183
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:15,209
WELL, HOW DO YOU KNOW
IF YOU HAVE A GOOD STORY?

184
00:06:15,292 --> 00:06:17,419
OKAY, WELL...

185
00:06:17,503 --> 00:06:19,213
UH, GREAT ARTISTS,

186
00:06:19,296 --> 00:06:23,467
THEY USE THEIR MEDIUM
TO SAY SOMETHING.

187
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:25,427
SO I DON'T KNOW...
YOU WANNA IMPRESS ME?

188
00:06:25,511 --> 00:06:27,012
DO THAT.

189
00:06:30,182 --> 00:06:32,017
FIONA:
AND FINALLY,
WE'LL GET THE UPDATES

190
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:33,602

FOR THE BIG STUDENT COUNCIL
FUNDRAISER.

192
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:37,064
SO DECORATIONS?

193
00:06:37,147 --> 00:06:38,690
TOTALLY UNDER CONTROL.

194
00:06:38,774 --> 00:06:40,943
FIONA:
OKAY. AND REFRESHMENTS?

195
00:06:41,026 --> 00:06:42,152
I FOUND A CATERER
WHO'LL DO IT FOR FREE.

196
00:06:42,236 --> 00:06:43,278
AWESOME.

197
00:06:43,362 --> 00:06:45,280
AND DONATIONS?

198
00:06:45,364 --> 00:06:46,198
HELLO? DONATIONS?

199
00:06:46,281 --> 00:06:47,574
UH, BECKY BAKER,

200
00:06:47,658 --> 00:06:50,035
HEAD OF SILENT AUCTION
DONATIONS.

201
00:06:50,118 --> 00:06:52,496
I HAVE REALLY BIG NEWS:
ADAM HAS JOINED MY TEAM.

202
00:06:54,581 --> 00:06:56,583
THAT'S IT?

203
00:06:56,667 --> 00:06:58,460
JENNA:

204
00:06:58,544 --> 00:06:59,670

205
00:06:59,753 --> 00:07:01,171
FIONA:

206
00:07:01,255 --> 00:07:03,340
EVEN MORE AMAZING,

00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:04,675
IS GOING TO BE PLAYING
DURING THE EVENT!

208
00:07:04,758 --> 00:07:06,260
(APPLAUDS)

209
00:07:08,929 --> 00:07:12,933
OKAY, LET'S BREAK UP INTO GROUPS
AND GET TO WORK!

210
00:07:13,016 --> 00:07:14,309
ADAM:
I'M ON THE DONATIONS COMMITTEE?

211
00:07:14,393 --> 00:07:15,686
WHAT DO WE DO,
EXACTLY?

212
00:07:15,769 --> 00:07:17,020
WELL, WE'RE GOING TO GO
DOOR-TO-DOOR

213
00:07:17,104 --> 00:07:18,647
TO LOCAL BUSINESSES

214
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:20,691
TO SEE IF THEY'LL DONATE ITEMS
FOR THE AUCTION,

215
00:07:20,774 --> 00:07:21,567
AND WE'LL HIT THE MALL
AFTER SCHOOL!

216
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:22,568
LUKE:
WEARING THESE.

217
00:07:22,651 --> 00:07:24,152
(GIGGLES)

218
00:07:26,363 --> 00:07:27,489
JENNA:
SO WHAT'S YOUR STRATEGY HERE?

219
00:07:27,573 --> 00:07:28,824
DID YOU ASK HIM OUT?

220
00:07:28,907 --> 00:07:30,242
I CHICKENED OUT

221
00:07:30,325 --> 00:07:31,285
AND ASKED HIM TO DO
THIS INSTEAD.

222
00:07:31,368 --> 00:07:33,161
REJECTION'S TOUGH,

223
00:07:33,245 --> 00:07:36,665
BUT IT'S BETTER TO KNOW
IF THE GUY DOESN'T LIKE YOU.

224
00:07:36,748 --> 00:07:38,667
BECKY:
YOU'RE RIGHT;
I HAVE TO FIND OUT.

225
00:07:46,216 --> 00:07:47,968
BIG MALL ADVENTURE TONIGHT!

226
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:53,557
I WORRY MAYBE
I FORCED YOU TO WORK

227
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,309
ON THE SILENT AUCTION.

228
00:07:55,392 --> 00:07:56,560
YA THINK?

229
00:07:56,643 --> 00:07:59,062
WELL, YOU DON'T HAVE TO,

230
00:07:59,146 --> 00:08:00,522
AND YOUR BAND CAN STILL PLAY
NO MATTER WHAT.

231
00:08:00,606 --> 00:08:01,982
BUT I HOPE YOU WANT TO,

232
00:08:02,065 --> 00:08:03,317
'CAUSE WORKING ON THE EVENT

233
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,902
MEANS YOU'D HELP
THE SCHOOL,

234
00:08:04,985 --> 00:08:07,321
AND YOU'D GET TO WORK CLOSELY
WITH PEOPLE LIKE...

235
00:08:07,404 --> 00:08:08,906

236
00:08:11,241 --> 00:08:13,911

00:08:16,914 --> 00:08:18,415

BUT ONLY IF YOU WANT TO...

240
00:08:20,751 --> 00:08:22,252
WHICH I HOPE YOU DO,

241
00:08:22,336 --> 00:08:26,798
BECAUSE I'D LIKE TO WORK
CLOSELY WITH YOU.

242
00:08:26,882 --> 00:08:28,550
WE ARE HELPING THE SCHOOL
RAISE MONEY.

243
00:08:30,052 --> 00:08:31,553
IS THAT A YES?

244
00:08:32,804 --> 00:08:34,473
I'LL SEE YOU AT THE MALL
TONIGHT.

245
00:08:40,395 --> 00:08:43,440
BIANCA:
IS IT GOOD ENOUGH TO WIN ME
FIVE GRAND IN SCHOLARSHIP MONEY?

246
00:08:43,524 --> 00:08:46,610
BIANCA,
THIS IS BEAUTIFUL.

247
00:08:46,693 --> 00:08:49,530
WOW, I WISH DREW HAD
YOUR DETERMINATION.

248
00:08:49,613 --> 00:08:51,114
DREW DOES.

249
00:08:51,198 --> 00:08:51,698
HE'S DOING REALLY GREAT
AT HIS JOB.

250
00:08:51,782 --> 00:08:54,493
YOU SHOULD SEE HIM.

251
00:08:54,576 --> 00:08:56,787
HAS HE MADE ANY LIFE-ALTERING
DECISIONS THIS WEEK?

252
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:58,372
NO. WHY?

253
00:09:00,582 --> 00:09:02,835
WELL, YOU KNOW,
HE DROPPED OUT OF SCHOOL,

254
00:09:02,918 --> 00:09:04,545
BOUGHT A MOTORCYCLE...

255
00:09:04,628 --> 00:09:07,214
WHAT'S NEXT?

256
00:09:07,297 --> 00:09:08,507
FOR ALL I KNOW,
HE'S GONNA MOVE TO JAPAN.

257
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:10,092
NO. NOTHING NEW.

258
00:09:11,552 --> 00:09:13,053
(SIGHS HEAVILY)
I JUST FEEL SO...

259
00:09:14,847 --> 00:09:16,348
OUT OF TOUCH
WITH HIS LIFE.

260
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:20,269
BUT AT LEAST I KNOW
HE HAS YOU.

261
00:09:20,352 --> 00:09:22,312
YEAH. HE DOES.

262
00:09:22,396 --> 00:09:24,356

IS MOST IMPORTANT?

314
00:11:18,595 --> 00:11:20,472
I WANT TO SHOW BRET
THAT I HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY.

315

BOTH OF THESE ARE REALLY
"THINKY."

316
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:24,768
WHY NOT AIM FOR SOMETHING
MORE ACHIEVABLE?

317

NO. I NEED TO IMPRESS HIM

318

327
00:11:43,912 --> 00:11:45,664

YEAH.
IT'S PROBABLY STILL THERE.

331
00:11:52,504 --> 00:11:54,339
HOW'D YOU COME UP
WITH THAT IDEA?

332
00:11:54,423 --> 00:11:55,632

00:11:58,635 --> 00:12:02,764
OKAY, BUT IT'S GOTTA STAY
OUR LITTLE SECRET.
YEAH.

335
00:12:11,648 --> 00:12:13,942
WHY SO GLUM?

336
00:12:14,026 --> 00:12:16,612
DID THINGS NOT GO WELL
WITH ADAM LAST NIGHT?

337
00:12:16,695 --> 00:12:18,655
I'M PRETTY SURE
HE LIKES ME.

338
00:12:18,739 --> 00:12:20,240
OH, BECKY,
THAT'S EXCITING.

339
00:12:21,742 --> 00:12:24,119

DOING TWIRLS?

00:12:24,203 --> 00:12:25,662
I WAS,
UNTIL LUKE POINTED OUT

341
00:12:25,746 --> 00:12:27,706
THAT MY PARENTS
WILL NEVER APPROVE.

342
00:12:27,789 --> 00:12:29,249
ARE YOU SURE?
THEY SEEM REALLY NICE.

343
00:12:29,333 --> 00:12:30,918
THEY ARE,

344
00:12:31,001 --> 00:12:32,794
BUT THEY'RE EXTREMELY
CONSERVATIVE.

345
00:12:32,878 --> 00:12:34,546
THEN KEEP HIM A SECRET.

346
00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:36,798
LIE TO MY PARENTS?

347
00:12:36,882 --> 00:12:38,509

00:12:53,774 --> 00:12:55,484
BECKY BAKER,

353
00:12:55,567 --> 00:12:57,402
WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS
ON THE ELUSIVE DULCINEA?

354
00:12:57,486 --> 00:12:59,363
ACTUALLY, SIR,

355
00:12:59,446 --> 00:13:01,031
I WAS HOPING
FOR A HALL PASS?

356
00:13:01,114 --> 00:13:02,616
RIGHT, WELL,
MAKE IT QUICK!

357
00:13:04,535 --> 00:13:06,036
ANYONE ELSE?

358
00:13:16,088 --> 00:13:18,257
ADAM, I REALLY,
REALLY LIKE YOU.

359
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:25,806
I'M SENSING A
"BUT YOU'RE TRANSGENDER."

360
00:13:28,392 --> 00:13:30,269
I SHOULD'VE KNOWN BETTER
THAN TO FALL FOR YOU.

361
00:13:30,352 --> 00:13:32,563
YOU FELL FOR ME?

362
00:13:32,646 --> 00:13:34,147
THE FIRST TIME
I MET YOU.

363
00:13:35,983 --> 00:13:37,484
ADAM,
I LIKE YOU A LOT.

364
00:13:39,444 --> 00:13:41,655
BUT MY PARENTS,
THEY'RE TRADITIONAL.

365
00:13:41,738 --> 00:13:44,533
THEY'LL NEVER APPROVE.

366
00:13:44,616 --> 00:13:46,118
BUT YOU'RE OKAY WITH ME?

367
00:13:49,371 --> 00:13:51,498
WILL YOU BE
MY SECRET BOYFRIEND?

368
00:13:51,582 --> 00:13:53,625
I'M NOT ASHAMED,

369
00:13:53,709 --> 00:13:54,126
I JUST DON'T WANT THEM
TO FORBID ME FROM SEEING YOU.

370
00:13:54,209 --> 00:13:55,711
STOP.

371
00:13:55,794 --> 00:13:57,337
GO BACK TO THE PART

372
00:13:57,421 --> 00:13:59,339
WHERE YOU ASKED ME
TO BE YOUR BOYFRIEND.

373
00:13:59,965 --> 00:14:01,425
WILL YOU?

374
00:14:01,508 --> 00:14:03,010
SURE. WHY NOT?

375
00:14:22,905 --> 00:14:24,698
JAKE:
OKAY. YOU CAN'T TELL CLARE.

376
00:14:24,781 --> 00:14:26,950
ELI:
BUT WE SHARE EVERYTHING.

377
00:14:27,034 --> 00:14:29,536
JAKE:
PLEASE TELL ME YOU'RE KIDDING.
EVERYTHING?

378
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:32,539
WELL, NOT EVERYTHING,
BUT... MOST THINGS.

379
00:14:32,623 --> 00:14:33,832
JAKE:
BUT YOU CAN'T TELL HER THIS.

380
00:14:33,916 --> 00:14:34,625
YOU GOTTA-
YOU GOTTA PROMISE.

381
00:14:34,708 --> 00:14:35,501
YEAH, YEAH,
I PROMISE.

382
00:14:35,584 --> 00:14:37,628
CROSS YOUR HEART?

383
00:14:37,711 --> 00:14:39,505
OKAY, WHY ARE YOU
ACTING SO WEIRD?

384
00:14:41,465 --> 00:14:43,967
THAT'S YOUR SECRET -
POT?

385
00:14:44,051 --> 00:14:45,552
WELL, I PREFER TO CALL IT
BY ITS PROPER NAME.

386
00:14:45,636 --> 00:14:48,055
MARIJUANA.

387
00:14:48,138 --> 00:14:50,224
YOU WERE ON DRUGS
WHEN YOU SHOT YOUR FILM?

388
00:14:50,307 --> 00:14:52,976
YEAH, YEAH.
MOST DEFINITELY, YEAH.

389
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:54,311
BUT IF YOU'RE NOT INTERESTED...

390
00:14:54,394 --> 00:14:55,896
I'M NO PUSHER.

391
00:14:57,564 --> 00:14:59,066
WAIT. HOL-

392
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:05,072
DO I HAVE
TO INHALE?

393
00:15:07,282 --> 00:15:09,284
I DON'T KNOW, B.

394
00:15:09,368 --> 00:15:09,952
YOU REALLY THINK THE DOT'S
A BIG ENOUGH PLACE

395
00:15:10,035 --> 00:15:11,537
FOR A WEDDING?

396
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:15,374
OH MY GOD, WE GOTTA GO.
MY MOM'S HERE.

397
00:15:15,457 --> 00:15:17,501
HEY, I LIED ABOUT
THE WEDDING STUFF.

398
00:15:17,584 --> 00:15:18,710
I ASKED AUDRA
TO MEET US HERE.

399
00:15:18,794 --> 00:15:20,128
YOU TRICKED ME?

400
00:15:20,212 --> 00:15:21,922
IT SUCKS TO BE LIED TO,
RIGHT?

401
00:15:22,005 --> 00:15:23,590
I CAN'T LIE TO AUDRA
ANYMORE, DREW.

402
00:15:23,674 --> 00:15:24,216
IF WE TELL HER,
SHE'LL FIND A WAY

403
00:15:24,299 --> 00:15:26,051
TO RUIN EVERYTHING!

404
00:15:26,134 --> 00:15:27,845
LOOK, AUDRA IS THE CLOSEST THING
I'VE EVER HAD TO A MOM,

405
00:15:27,928 --> 00:15:28,804
AND IT'S REALLY
IMPORTANT TO ME

406
00:15:28,887 --> 00:15:30,472
THAT SHE'S A PART
OF THIS.

407
00:15:30,556 --> 00:15:32,057
(SIGHS)

408
00:15:33,225 --> 00:15:34,852
SHE MEANS THAT MUCH
TO YOU?

409
00:15:37,354 --> 00:15:40,315
ALL RIGHT. FINE.
IF IT'LL MAKE YOU HAPPY.

410
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:41,900
REALLY?
YEAH.

411
00:15:55,747 --> 00:15:57,749
MR. BAKER:
WHO'S A?

412
00:15:57,833 --> 00:15:59,334
BECKY:
ADAM.

413
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:01,545
MR. BAKER:
IS THIS ADAM A BOYFRIEND?

414
00:16:03,589 --> 00:16:06,592
UM, HE'S A BOY
WHO'S A FRIEND.

415
00:16:06,675 --> 00:16:09,928
YOU KNOW, YOU'RE NOT
JUST LYING TO ME, BECKY.

416
00:16:10,012 --> 00:16:12,681
OKAY, ADAM'S A LITTLE MORE
THAN A FRIEND.

417
00:16:15,559 --> 00:16:17,686
SO WHEN DO I MEET HIM?

418
00:16:17,769 --> 00:16:19,188
WHAT?!

419
00:16:19,271 --> 00:16:21,106
YOU KNOW MY RULES,
KIDDO.

420
00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:22,524
BE POLITE,
SAY MY PRAYERS,

421
00:16:22,608 --> 00:16:23,650
AND BRUSH AFTER
EVERY MEAL?

422
00:16:23,734 --> 00:16:25,777
ABOUT BOYS.

423
00:16:25,861 --> 00:16:26,737
YOU'RE ONLY ALLOWED
TO DATE IF...

424
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:29,239
YOU MEET THE GUY FIRST.

425
00:16:29,323 --> 00:16:31,450
WHY DON'T YOU ASK HIM OVER
FOR DINNER, TONIGHT?!

426
00:16:31,533 --> 00:16:33,160
UH, I THINK HE'S BUSY.

427
00:16:35,621 --> 00:16:36,914
IS THERE SOME REASON

428
00:16:36,997 --> 00:16:38,457
WHY YOU DON'T WANT US
TO MEET HIM?

429
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:39,583
DOES HE HAVE A TATTOO?

430
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:41,877
NO. NO TATTOO.

431
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:43,712
HE DRIVES
A MOTORCYCLE?
DAD...

432
00:16:43,795 --> 00:16:44,713
WELL, THERE IS GOTTA BE
SOMETHING WRONG WITH HIM

433
00:16:44,796 --> 00:16:45,797
IF YOU HAVEN'T
BROUGHT HIM HOME.

434
00:16:45,881 --> 00:16:49,259
THERE'S NOTHING WRONG
WITH HIM.

435
00:16:49,343 --> 00:16:51,887
HE'S THE NICEST GUY
I'VE EVER MET.

436
00:16:51,970 --> 00:16:53,472
THEN IT'S SETTLED.
INVITE HIM OVER.

437
00:16:55,641 --> 00:16:57,142
OKAY.

438
00:16:59,978 --> 00:17:00,312
I PROMISE
I WON'T EMBARRASS YOU,

439
00:17:00,395 --> 00:17:02,397
BUTTERCUP.

440
00:17:02,481 --> 00:17:04,149
ALTHOUGH I CAN'T SPEAK
FOR YOUR MOTHER.

441
00:17:06,318 --> 00:17:09,404
AUDRA:
MY SON, IN THE FLESH.

442
00:17:09,488 --> 00:17:10,739
YOU KNOW, WHEN BIANCA TOLD ME
YOU WANTED TO TALK,

443
00:17:10,822 --> 00:17:12,783
I'LL BE HONEST,
I DIDN'T BELIEVE IT.

444
00:17:15,244 --> 00:17:18,038
DREW CAME BECAUSE
WE HAVE SOMETHING TO TELL YOU.

445
00:17:18,121 --> 00:17:19,498
OH GOD,
YOU'RE PREGNANT!

446
00:17:19,581 --> 00:17:22,209
NO! NO. GOD, NO.

447
00:17:22,292 --> 00:17:24,503
(RELIEVED SIGH)
THANK GOODNESS.

448
00:17:24,586 --> 00:17:27,089
OH, I'M TOO YOUNG
TO BE A GRANDMOTHER.

449
00:17:33,428 --> 00:17:35,013
WE'RE GETTING MARRIED
THIS SUMMER.

450
00:17:37,558 --> 00:17:39,142
SERIOUSLY?
YOU CAN'T STOP US.

451
00:17:39,226 --> 00:17:40,727
DREW,
LET YOUR MOM SPEAK.

452
00:17:42,938 --> 00:17:44,565
YOU DON'T HAVE
LIFE EXPERIENCE

453
00:17:44,648 --> 00:17:47,025
TO MAKE THIS DECISION.

454
00:17:47,109 --> 00:17:48,777
YOU DIDN'T EVEN GRADUATE
FROM HIGH SCHOOL.

455
00:17:48,861 --> 00:17:50,821
THANKS FOR BEING
SO PREDICTABLE, MOM.

456
00:17:50,904 --> 00:17:52,030
BIANCA:

WE GET MARRIED,

457
00:17:52,114 --> 00:17:53,699
AND DREW PROMISED ME
HE'D GET HIS GED.

458
00:17:53,782 --> 00:17:55,617
WHATEVER.
I'M OUTTA HERE.

459
00:17:55,701 --> 00:17:57,202
AUDRA:
DREW!

460
00:17:58,912 --> 00:18:00,414
BIANCA.
BIANCA...

461
00:18:01,665 --> 00:18:04,001
YOU HAVE COME SO FAR.

462
00:18:04,084 --> 00:18:05,002
WHY NOT JUST WAIT
UNTIL YOU'VE GRADUATED

463
00:18:05,085 --> 00:18:06,128
FROM UNIVERSITY?

464
00:18:06,211 --> 00:18:07,713
WHY RUSH THIS?

465
00:18:09,756 --> 00:18:12,593
(DREW KNOCKS ON GLASS)
YOU COMING OR WHAT?

466
00:18:12,676 --> 00:18:14,511
BIANCA, PLEASE,
THINK ABOUT IT.

467
00:18:17,931 --> 00:18:19,433
I'M SORRY.

468
00:18:33,447 --> 00:18:34,948
(PHONE RINGS)

469
00:18:36,909 --> 00:18:38,035
ADAM:
HELLO?

470
00:18:38,118 --> 00:18:39,995
ARE YOU FREE TONIGHT?

471
00:18:40,078 --> 00:18:41,580
ADAM:
UH... I COULD BE.
MOVIE?

472
00:18:43,290 --> 00:18:45,250
NO. MY PARENTS KINDA WANNA
HAVE YOU OVER.

473
00:18:47,503 --> 00:18:48,921
BUT IF YOU'RE BUSY
IT'S TOTALLY OKAY.

474
00:18:49,004 --> 00:18:50,506
I CAN RESCHEDULE.

475
00:18:50,589 --> 00:18:52,966
HOW DO YOUR PARENTS KNOW
I EXIST?

476
00:18:53,050 --> 00:18:55,344
BECKY:
UM, MY DAD'S JUST SUCH
A GOOD GUESSER.

477
00:18:55,427 --> 00:18:57,262
I MEAN, YOU HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT A GOOD GUESSER MY DAD IS.

478
00:18:57,346 --> 00:18:58,722
YOU'RE A TERRIBLE LIAR.

479
00:18:58,805 --> 00:19:01,099
OKAY.

480
00:19:01,183 --> 00:19:03,018
I ACCIDENTALLY TOLD HIM
I HAVE A BOYFRIEND,

481
00:19:03,101 --> 00:19:04,645
AND NOW HE WANTS
TO MEET YOU.

482
00:19:04,728 --> 00:19:06,563
SOMEONE CAN'T KEEP A SECRET.

483
00:19:06,647 --> 00:19:08,357
WHAT'RE WE GONNA DO?

484
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:10,192
UH, EAT DINNER?
MAYBE DESSERT.

485
00:19:10,275 --> 00:19:11,985
ADAM, THIS IS SERIOUS.

486
00:19:12,069 --> 00:19:13,904
OKAY. I'M SORRY.
UM...

487
00:19:13,987 --> 00:19:15,280
EVERYTHING'S GONNA BE OKAY.

488
00:19:15,364 --> 00:19:17,783
NO! IT'S NOT GONNA BE OKAY.

489
00:19:17,866 --> 00:19:19,493
IF MY PARENTS MEET YOU,
THEY'LL FREAK OUT.

490
00:19:19,576 --> 00:19:21,078
THEY'LL NEVER LET US
SEE EACH OTHER.

491
00:19:21,161 --> 00:19:22,663
WE NEED A PLAN.

492
00:19:22,746 --> 00:19:24,373
BECKY, I'M A BOY.

493
00:19:26,375 --> 00:19:29,419
I KNOW THAT,
BUT MY DAD-

494
00:19:29,503 --> 00:19:31,463
I PASSED WHEN I MET YOU,
RIGHT?

495
00:19:31,547 --> 00:19:33,590
THAT'S TRUE.

496
00:19:33,674 --> 00:19:35,175
UNLESS THEY ASK TO SEE
MY DRIVERS' LICENSE,

497
00:19:35,259 --> 00:19:36,593
YOUR PARENTS
WILL HAVE NO CLUE.

498
00:19:36,677 --> 00:19:38,178
I PROMISE.

499
00:19:39,721 --> 00:19:41,348
ARE YOU SURE
WE CAN DO THIS?

500
00:19:41,431 --> 00:19:42,933
ADAM:
TRUST ME.

501
00:19:46,854 --> 00:19:48,897
ELI:
I-I CAN'T BELIEVE
HOW OBVIOUS THIS WAS!

502
00:19:51,859 --> 00:19:53,443
HEY, YOU JUST NEEDED
A LITTLE NUDGE.

503
00:19:53,527 --> 00:19:55,529
IT'S ABOUT LOVE, LIFE,
WAR, LOVE...

504
00:19:57,281 --> 00:19:58,323
I SAID LOVE TWICE.

505
00:19:58,407 --> 00:19:59,783
BUT THAT'S OKAY

506
00:19:59,867 --> 00:20:01,743
BECAUSE LOVE IS
A BIG PART OF LIFE.

507
00:20:01,827 --> 00:20:03,537
OH, THAT IS GOOD.

508
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:05,289
I NEED REMEMBER THAT
SO I CAN SAY THAT TO BRET.

509
00:20:05,372 --> 00:20:06,415
UH, PEN ME.

510
00:20:06,498 --> 00:20:08,000
JAKE:
YEAH!

511
00:20:08,625 --> 00:20:10,377
(PEN CLATTERS ON FLOOR)

512
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:11,837
YOU KNOW WHAT? FORGET IT.
I'LL REMEMBER IT.

513
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:13,547
WAIT. WHAT'D I SAY?

514
00:20:13,630 --> 00:20:15,424
SOMETHING ABOUT LIFE.

515
00:20:15,507 --> 00:20:16,675
OKAY! UM...

516
00:20:16,758 --> 00:20:19,845
NEW TITLE: "LIFE."

517
00:20:19,928 --> 00:20:24,016
NO! NO! NO!
"LIFE: THE SHORT FILM."

518
00:20:24,099 --> 00:20:26,518
(TALKING TO HIMSELF)
AND WE CROSS-FADE...
UH, WIPE TO COLOUR,

519
00:20:26,602 --> 00:20:27,811
THEN BACK TO BLACK AND WHITE.

520
00:20:27,895 --> 00:20:29,313
THEN WE FADE IN,

521
00:20:29,396 --> 00:20:33,358
AND UM... STAR WIPE,

522
00:20:33,442 --> 00:20:35,194
FADE BACK OUT.

523
00:20:35,277 --> 00:20:36,778
AND...THE END.

524
00:20:39,281 --> 00:20:41,408
THIS IS THE BEST THING

HE HAS AN OLDER BROTHER.

531
00:20:52,503 --> 00:20:55,297

00:21:15,901 --> 00:21:16,527
BUT I'M ACTUALLY THINKING
OF GOING OUT
