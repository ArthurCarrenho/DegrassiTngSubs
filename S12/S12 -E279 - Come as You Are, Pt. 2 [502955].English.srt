THIS MORNING-THIS MORNING
MY CONDOM WAS MISSING.

193
00:09:38,745 --> 00:09:40,414
I HAD SEX WITH KATIE.

194
00:09:44,001 --> 00:09:47,296
YOU HAVE A PROBLEM

TWO GIRLS LIKE YOU.
TWO GREAT GIRLS.

196
00:09:49,047 --> 00:09:50,257
HOW COULD YOU DO THIS?

00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:54,553
AND I CAN'T BREAK UP
WITH KATIE

200
00:09:54,636 --> 00:09:56,180
THE DAY AFTER WE LOST
OUR VIRGINITY TO EACH OTHER.

EITHER KATIE'S TAKING
THE BREAK UP SUPER WELL,

IT HAPPENED, ALL RIGHT,
BUT IT KINDA REVERSED.

223

SHE THINKS
WE'RE BACK TOGETHER.

224

HAVE YOU DONE THIS?

DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

307
00:14:10,309 --> 00:14:11,810
WHAT IF SHE TRIES
TO HUG YOU?

308
00:14:11,894 --> 00:14:13,353
YOU NEVER HUG OR TOUCH
AFTER A BREAK UP.

309
00:14:13,437 --> 00:14:14,730
IT COULD LEAD TO MORE.

310
00:14:14,813 --> 00:14:15,981
OKAY, BUT WHAT IF SHE'S CRYING?

311
00:14:16,064 --> 00:14:17,858
AND SAYS SHE LOVES YOU?

312
00:14:17,941 --> 00:14:19,526
THEN... MAYBE A LITTLE HUG?

YOU CAN THROW IT OUT.

323
00:14:46,386 --> 00:14:47,804

00:15:52,661 --> 00:15:53,871
DON'T EVEN BOTHER.

351
00:15:53,954 --> 00:15:55,455
YOU'RE MY NEW HERO.

352
00:16:00,794 --> 00:16:02,588
ASHER:
TELL YOU WHAT, I'LL GIVE YOU
THAT PIECE ON LRT TRANSIT

353
00:16:02,671 --> 00:16:04,173
THAT YOU WANTED.

354
00:16:04,256 --> 00:16:06,133
FIFTEEN MINUTES?
COME ON.

355
00:16:06,216 --> 00:16:09,428
HALF AN HOUR, MY TERMS,
OR NO LRT.

356
00:16:09,511 --> 00:16:11,013
NOW WE'RE TALKING.
OKAY, SEE YOU TOMORROW.

357
00:16:11,096 --> 00:16:12,347
CLARE:
MR. SHOSTAK?

358
00:16:12,431 --> 00:16:14,016
SORRY TO INTERRUPT.

359
00:16:14,099 --> 00:16:15,934
I'M CLARE EDWARDS,
FROM DEGRASSI.

360
00:16:16,018 --> 00:16:16,518
HOW ARE YOU
WITH FACT CHECKING?

361
00:16:16,602 --> 00:16:17,519
GREAT.

362
00:16:17,603 --> 00:16:19,021
GOOD.

363
00:16:19,104 --> 00:16:22,357
YOU CAN GET STARTED
ON THESE.

364
00:16:22,441 --> 00:16:23,984
JUST SO YOU KNOW,
I GET FIVE REQUESTS A DAY

365
00:16:24,067 --> 00:16:25,152
FROM STUDENTS WANTING
A CO-OP.

366
00:16:25,235 --> 00:16:26,570
THIS IS A COVETED SPOT.

367
00:16:26,653 --> 00:16:27,821
I KNOW,
AND I AM VERY GRATEFUL.

368
00:16:27,905 --> 00:16:28,947
I DON'T WANT YOU
TO BE GRATEFUL.

369
00:16:29,031 --> 00:16:31,533
I WANT YOU TO BE SERIOUS
ABOUT JOURNALISM.

370
00:16:31,617 --> 00:16:32,492
I AM MORE SERIOUS
ABOUT THIS THAN ANYTHING.

371
00:16:32,576 --> 00:16:34,494
I REALLY WANT TO LEARN.

372
00:16:34,578 --> 00:16:37,915
WHEN IT COMES TO WRITING,
WHAT'S MOST IMPORTANT TO YOU?

373
00:16:37,998 --> 00:16:39,374
THERE IS NO RIGHT
OR WRONG ANSWER,

374
00:16:39,458 --> 00:16:40,542
JUST GETTING A SENSE
OF WHAT YOU DO.

375
00:16:40,626 --> 00:16:42,127
UH...

376
00:16:42,628 --> 00:16:44,338
I'D SAY... CLARITY.

377
00:16:45,631 --> 00:16:48,300
JUST LIKE YOUR
NAME SUGGESTS.

378
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:49,927

384
00:17:05,275 --> 00:17:07,694
OKAY, WEIRDO.

385
00:17:07,778 --> 00:17:09,738
GUESS I'LL EAT A WHOLE
PLATE MYSELF.

386
00:17:09,821 --> 00:17:12,032
YOU READY TO ORDER?

387
00:17:12,115 --> 00:17:14,409
WE NEED TO TALK.

388
00:17:14,493 --> 00:17:16,745
OKAY. WELL, CAN IT WAIT
'TIL AFTER WE ORDER?

389
00:17:16,828 --> 00:17:19,373
I'VE BEEN WAITING WEEKS.

390
00:17:19,456 --> 00:17:20,958
I CAN'T WAIT ANYMORE.

(SIGHS)

392
00:17:23,585 --> 00:17:25,963
WE NEED TO BREAK UP.

393
00:17:26,046 --> 00:17:27,548
FOR GOOD THIS TIME.

394
00:17:29,591 --> 00:17:33,136
THAT'S WHY I ASKED YOU
TO COME HERE.

395
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:36,014
I DON'T WANT TO BE
WITH YOU ANYMORE.

396
00:17:36,098 --> 00:17:37,599
BUT YESTERDAY,
WE-WE TALKED.

397
00:17:39,476 --> 00:17:42,020
YOU SAID WE WERE
GONNA BE OKAY.

398
00:17:42,104 --> 00:17:43,605
WE HAD SEX.

399
00:17:44,648 --> 00:17:46,149
I WAS DRUNK.

400
00:17:47,609 --> 00:17:49,736
I DON'T EVEN REMEMBER.

401
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:51,405
YOU SAID YOU WEREN'T.

402
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:56,243
THIS IS MY WORST NIGHTMARE.

403
00:17:56,326 --> 00:17:57,828
WHY IS THIS HAPPENING TO ME?

404
00:17:59,621 --> 00:18:01,248
DREW:
WHEN YOU WERE ON DRUGS,

405
00:18:03,292 --> 00:18:05,878
I REALIZED I WANTED
TO BE WITH BIANCA.

406
00:18:05,961 --> 00:18:08,422
WE WAITED UNTIL
YOU WERE BETTER.

407
00:18:08,505 --> 00:18:10,174
SO I CAN BREAK UP
WITH YOU.

408
00:18:12,384 --> 00:18:13,886
I LOVED YOU.

409
00:18:16,096 --> 00:18:17,598
YOU'LL FIND SOMEONE NEW.

410
00:18:22,477 --> 00:18:24,188
BIANCA DOESN'T KNOW
THAT WE HAD SEX...

411
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:29,568
YOU CAN'T TELL ANYONE.

428
00:19:36,426 --> 00:19:38,512
ELI:
AWESOME!
SHOULD I COME GET YOU?

429
00:19:38,595 --> 00:19:40,097
ACTUALLY...

430
00:19:42,766 --> 00:19:45,811
ASHER ASKED ME TO GO WITH
HIS TEAM TO COVER A PROTEST.

431
00:19:45,894 --> 00:19:48,272
ARE YOU MAD?

432
00:19:48,355 --> 00:19:51,149
NAH, I'M JUST GONNA GO DRIVE
MY HEARSE INTO A WALL.

433
00:19:51,233 --> 00:19:52,734
I'LL SEE YOU LATER.

434
00:19:54,653 --> 00:19:56,154
I'M KIDDING!

435
00:19:56,238 --> 00:19:57,614
ELI!

436
00:19:57,698 --> 00:19:59,199
ELI:
(CHUCKLE) SORRY!

437
00:20:00,701 --> 00:20:02,494
SERIOUSLY THOUGH, WE CAN GO
ON OUR RE-FIRST DATE ANYTIME.

438
00:20:02,578 --> 00:20:04,121
CLARE:
I KNOW, BUT IT WAS IMPORTANT
TO ME.

439
00:20:04,204 --> 00:20:05,789
ELI:
YEAH. ME TOO.

440
00:20:05,873 --> 00:20:08,333
BUT BEING "ALL IN" DOESN'T
MEAN DROPPING EVERYTHING.

441
00:20:08,417 --> 00:20:09,585
AND JUST BECAUSE YOU CANCEL
A DATE ON ME,

442
00:20:09,668 --> 00:20:11,170
DOESN'T MEAN I'M GONNA LOSE IT.

443
00:20:12,671 --> 00:20:14,173
I KNEW THAT, YOU KNOW?

444
00:20:15,549 --> 00:20:17,092

THE CEILING WHEN I TELL HIM.

446
00:20:19,386 --> 00:20:21,305
AND SINCE YOU FOUND YOUR THING,

447
00:20:21,388 --> 00:20:23,640
MAYBE THE SHOW WILL
INSPIRE ME TO FIND MINE.

448
00:20:23,724 --> 00:20:25,726
YOU KNOW, BULK UP MY NYU
PORTFOLIO.

449
00:20:25,809 --> 00:20:28,020

SEEN HER FACE.

ANYONE SO SAD.

458
00:20:54,379 --> 00:20:58,133
WELL, AT LEAST THE HARDEST
PART'S OVER.

459
00:20:58,217 --> 00:21:00,385
AND THE BEST PART'S
JUST STARTING.

467
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:19,988
NOW THAT EVERYTHING'S OUT
IN THE OPEN.

468
00:21:21,698 --> 00:21:23,200
IS IT?

469
00:21:28,247 --> 00:21:30,082
WHAT WAS THAT ABOUT?

470
00:21:30,165 --> 00:21:32,334
NO IDEA.

471
00:21:32,417 --> 00:21:33,794
ARE MY CLOTHES THAT SLUTTY?

472
00:21:33,877 --> 00:21:35,420
(CHUCKLES)

473
00:21:35,504 --> 00:21:37,422
DO ME A FAVOUR?

474
00:21:37,506 --> 00:21:39,925
AND DON'T EVER LISTEN TO
ANYTHING THOSE GIRLS SAY.

475
00:21:40,008 --> 00:21:41,510
OKAY.
