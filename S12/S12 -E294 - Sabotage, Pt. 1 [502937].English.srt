00:20:22,055 --> 00:20:23,891
YOU SCREWED US OVER!

522
00:20:23,974 --> 00:20:25,392
KATIE:
YEAH WELL, NOW YOU KNOW
WHAT IT'S LIKE

523
00:20:25,475 --> 00:20:27,811
TO HAVE SOMETHING YOU CARE
ABOUT TAKEN AWAY FROM YOU.

524
00:20:27,895 --> 00:20:29,563
AREN'T YOU TWO
JUST THE CUTEST?!

525
00:20:29,646 --> 00:20:32,357
I DID NOTHING TO YOU!

526
00:20:32,441 --> 00:20:34,568
YOU MESS WITH MY FRIENDS,
YOU MESS WITH ME.

527
00:20:34,651 --> 00:20:36,195
JUST BACK OFF, DALLAS.

528
00:20:36,278 --> 00:20:38,864
IT'S OVER.

529
00:20:38,947 --> 00:20:41,366
YOU LIKE TO AIR OTHER PEOPLE'S
DIRTY LAUNDRY IN PUBLIC?

530
00:20:41,450 --> 00:20:44,077
HOW WOULD YOUR BOYFRIEND HERE
LIKE TO KNOW YOURS?

531
00:20:47,497 --> 00:20:50,709
WHAT'S HE TALKING ABOUT?

532
00:20:50,792 --> 00:20:52,336
UH, DALLAS FOUND OUT
THAT UM...

533
00:20:55,964 --> 00:20:56,673
I GOT FIRED FROM
"THE INTERPRETER"

534
00:20:56,757 --> 00:20:58,634
A FEW WEEKS AGO.

535
00:20:58,717 --> 00:20:59,218
SEE, I KNEW THERE WAS
SOMETHING GOING ON WITH YOU.

536
00:20:59,301 --> 00:21:01,553
WHAT HAPPENED?

537
00:21:01,637 --> 00:21:03,138
ASHER UH...

538
00:21:06,475 --> 00:21:07,976
HE...

539
00:21:11,647 --> 00:21:12,981
DIDN'T THINK
I WAS GOOD ENOUGH.

540
00:21:13,065 --> 00:21:14,983
HE SAID I WAS A BAD WRITER.

541
00:21:15,067 --> 00:21:16,568
BUT THAT DOESN'T MAKE
ANY SENSE.

542
00:21:16,652 --> 00:21:19,446
I THOUGHT WRITING
THIS ARTICLE

543
00:21:19,530 --> 00:21:22,741
AND EXPOSING THE HOCKEY TEAM
WOULD HELP ME GET OVER IT,

544
00:21:22,824 --> 00:21:24,910
BUT IT DIDN'T,
I FEEL WORSE.

545
00:21:24,993 --> 00:21:26,995
WHAT CAN I DO?

546
00:21:27,079 --> 00:21:28,580
YOU CAN'T DO ANYTHING.

547
00:21:30,123 --> 00:21:32,209
NO ONE CAN.

548
00:21:32,292 --> 00:21:33,794
(BELL RINGS)

549
00:21:34,419 --> 00:21:35,921
I HAVE MATH.
