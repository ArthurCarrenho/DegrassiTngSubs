00:00:17,017 --> 00:00:18,519
I'M SICK ABOUT IT.

7
00:00:23,357 --> 00:00:24,858
CAN YOU EVER
FORGIVE ME?

8
00:00:27,402 --> 00:00:29,279
I'M GONNA TAKE
THE DAY OFF SCHOOL,

IMOGEN, I DON'T WANT YOU
TO WORRY ABOUT ME.

11
00:00:32,533 --> 00:00:34,243
IN FACT, I REFUSE.

12
00:00:34,326 --> 00:00:36,537
I DO WORRY ABOUT YOU,
DAD.

13
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:38,121

00:03:29,001 --> 00:03:30,294
YOU'VE TAKEN HIM
TO OUR PLACE, THAT'S ALL.

90
00:03:30,377 --> 00:03:31,670
UH, WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
"OUR PLACE"?

ABOUT SOMETHING?

93
00:03:34,464 --> 00:03:36,967
WHY WOULD I BE UPSET?

UM, A FEW THINGS: ONE,

101
00:03:48,729 --> 00:03:50,606
DALLAS IS ACTUALLY A NICE GUY
AND WE HAVE STUFF IN COMMON.

102
00:03:50,689 --> 00:03:52,316
OH, ISN'T THAT NICE.

103
00:03:52,399 --> 00:03:53,609
AND TWO, YOU HAVE NO RIGHT
TO BE MAD.

104
00:03:53,692 --> 00:03:55,694
YOU AND I AREN'T DATING.

105
00:03:55,777 --> 00:03:58,030
YEAH, I KNOW THAT,
I'M JUST SURPRISED.

106
00:03:58,113 --> 00:04:01,617
I MEAN...
A JOCK BROKE YOUR HEART.

107
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:03,076
NOW YOU'RE FINDING ANOTHER ONE
TO HANG OUT WITH.

108
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:04,661
ARE YOU REALLY GOING
TO AN ICE HOUNDS GAME?

109
00:04:04,745 --> 00:04:07,581
YOU KNOW WHAT?
YEAH. NOW I AM!

110
00:04:07,664 --> 00:04:09,333
P.S.: YOU'RE ACTING LIKE
A JEALOUS JERK.

WHAT WERE YOU THINKING?!

113
00:04:16,048 --> 00:04:20,427
IMOGEN:
I WAS JUST TRYING TO KNOCK
SOME MATH INTO HER?

114
00:04:20,511 --> 00:04:21,929
HITTING A STUDENT WITH
A TEXTBOOK ISN'T YOU.

115
00:04:22,012 --> 00:04:23,388
WHAT'S GOING ON?

116
00:04:23,472 --> 00:04:25,516
STRESS, SIR.

117
00:04:25,599 --> 00:04:28,268
IT'S A HUGE ISSUE
WITH TEENS NOWADAYS.

118
00:04:28,352 --> 00:04:29,061
WELL, THERE ARE OTHER WAYS
TO COPE WITH STRESS

119
00:04:29,144 --> 00:04:30,646
THAN VIOLENCE.

120
00:04:32,481 --> 00:04:33,440
I'M GONNA HAVE TO SCHEDULE
AN APPOINTMENT

121
00:04:33,524 --> 00:04:35,609
WITH A COUNSELOR
TO DISCUSS THIS.

122
00:04:35,692 --> 00:04:37,528
CAN IT WAIT UNTIL AFTER
I'M DONE BUILDING THE SETS?

123
00:04:37,611 --> 00:04:38,904
FINE.
BUT I'M GOTTA CALL YOUR DAD.

124
00:04:38,987 --> 00:04:41,990
WAIT! I MEAN, I'D PREFER
IF YOU CALLED MY MOM.

125

126
00:04:43,492 --> 00:04:44,993
WELL, UH...

127
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:48,372
SHE IS NOT LISTED
AS ONE OF YOUR GUARDIANS.

128
00:04:48,455 --> 00:04:50,123
IT MUST BE AN OVERSIGHT.

HERE YOU GO.

134
00:05:02,719 --> 00:05:04,471
LOOK AT YOU,
UPSTAGING THE BIG MUSICAL!

135
00:05:04,555 --> 00:05:06,765
HOW MUCH DID YOU RAISE?

136
00:05:06,849 --> 00:05:08,350
DOESN'T MATTER.
IT'S DIRTY MONEY.

137
00:05:11,103 --> 00:05:13,188
YESTERDAY, ADAM SAID
I WAS USING MY CAUSE

138
00:05:13,272 --> 00:05:16,567
TO SPITE THE PLAY.

139
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:17,985
HE'S JUST JEALOUS YOU'RE RAISING
MORE MONEY THAN HE IS.

140
00:05:18,068 --> 00:05:20,195
NO, HE'S RIGHT.

141
00:05:20,279 --> 00:05:21,822
MY INTENTIONS STARTED
AS PURE,

142
00:05:21,905 --> 00:05:22,823
BUT WHEN I SAW
THE MUSICAL POSTERS,

143
00:05:22,906 --> 00:05:25,409
I WAS MOTIVATED BY HATE.

144
00:05:25,492 --> 00:05:27,244
AND IT WASN'T ABOUT
THE FAMILIES ANYMORE.

145
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:29,413
IT WAS ABOUT MAKING ELI
AND HIS MUSICAL SUFFER.

146
00:05:29,496 --> 00:05:31,039
WHAT'RE YOU GONNA DO?

147
00:05:33,625 --> 00:05:35,377
START BY TAKING DOWN
THIS DISPLAY.

148
00:05:41,258 --> 00:05:44,219
THANKS FOR COMING,
NATALIE.

149
00:05:44,303 --> 00:05:46,305
SO HOW MANY DAYS
DID I GET?

150
00:05:46,388 --> 00:05:47,222
NATALIE GRANGER:
YOU'RE NOT GETTING SUSPENDED.

151
00:05:47,306 --> 00:05:48,599
I TALKED TO MR. SIMPSON

152
00:05:48,682 --> 00:05:50,017
ABOUT WHAT YOU'RE GOING
THROUGH...

153
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:51,602
WITH VOLTA.

154
00:05:54,229 --> 00:05:56,315
HMM. SO YOU'RE SPYING
ON US NOW?

155
00:05:56,398 --> 00:05:57,900
YOUR FATHER AND I TALKED.

156
00:05:59,484 --> 00:06:01,528
IMOGEN, I'M SO SORRY
FOR YOUR LOSS.

157
00:06:01,612 --> 00:06:04,114
SINCE WHEN DO YOU
AND DAD TALK?

158
00:06:04,198 --> 00:06:06,700
NATALIE GRANGER:
WE'VE ALWAYS KEPT
IN CONTACT.

159
00:06:06,783 --> 00:06:08,702
MORE SO NOW -
TO MEET WITH DOCTORS,

160
00:06:10,287 --> 00:06:11,788
CHECK ON HIS PROGRESS.

161
00:06:11,872 --> 00:06:13,916
PROGRESS?

162
00:06:13,999 --> 00:06:15,501
NATALIE GRANGER:
A FEW MONTHS AGO,

163
00:06:15,584 --> 00:06:17,711
YOUR FATHER WAS DIAGNOSED
WITH EARLY ONSET DEMENTIA.

164
00:06:17,794 --> 00:06:19,713
IT STARTS WITH SMALL
INCIDENTS:

165
00:06:19,796 --> 00:06:22,549
LOST ITEMS, FORGETFULNESS.

166
00:06:22,633 --> 00:06:24,593
A MONTH AGO,
HE WAS AT A MODERATE STAGE,

167
00:06:24,676 --> 00:06:25,302
BUT THINGS HAVE PROGRESSED
MORE QUICKLY

168
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:26,678
THAN WE EXPECTED.

169
00:06:26,762 --> 00:06:28,639
I'M WITH HIM EVERY DAY.
IT'S NOT THAT BAD.

170
00:06:28,722 --> 00:06:29,264
HE GETS DRESSED,
HE GOES TO WORK.

171
00:06:29,348 --> 00:06:31,475
HE REMEMBERS A LOT.

172
00:06:31,558 --> 00:06:34,311
MOST INSTANCES,
HE'LL BE FINE.

173
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:36,980
BUT AT ANY MOMENT
HE COULD DISCONNECT,

174
00:06:37,064 --> 00:06:39,399
BECOME IRRITABLE,
BLANK.

175

HE WAS MY TYPE,
