NO, YOU WEREN'T FLAT.

IT'D SOUND BETTER
IF I HAD SOMEONE

13
00:00:29,112 --> 00:00:30,072
BACKING ME UP
ON LEAD GUITAR,

14
00:00:30,155 --> 00:00:31,240
AND MAYBE A DRUM TRACK-

15
00:00:31,323 --> 00:00:32,908
MAYA,
THE SONG WAS FINE.

16
00:00:32,991 --> 00:00:34,910
THEN WHY THE SOUR FACE?

17
00:00:34,993 --> 00:00:36,954
THERE'S NO SOUR FACE.
IT'S JUST...

18
00:00:37,037 --> 00:00:38,080
I THOUGHT YOU WERE GONNA
PLAY THE CELLO

19
00:00:38,163 --> 00:00:39,206
FOR THE PAGEANT TALENT.

20
00:00:39,289 --> 00:00:42,167
WELL, I WAS...

21
00:00:42,251 --> 00:00:43,418
BUT THEN I THOUGHT SINGING
A SONG I WROTE

22
00:00:43,502 --> 00:00:45,796
MIGHT IMPRESS THE JUDGES;

23
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:47,130
INCREASE THE CHANCES
OF WINNING.

24
00:00:47,214 --> 00:00:48,799
YOU WANNA WIN
THE PAGEANT?

25
00:00:48,882 --> 00:00:49,466
IT'D BE KIND OF COOL,
DON'T YOU THINK?

26
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:50,926
OF COURSE, I THINK.

27
00:00:51,009 --> 00:00:52,719
BUT I LIVE
AND BREATHE PAGEANTS,

28
00:00:52,803 --> 00:00:53,804
AND YOU THINK
THEY'RE STUPID.

29
00:00:53,887 --> 00:00:55,973
I KNOW I DID AT FIRST,

30
00:00:56,056 --> 00:00:57,599
BUT WHEN I MADE IT
THE FINALS,

31
00:00:57,683 --> 00:01:00,269
I FELT... I DON'T KNOW...
SPECIAL.

32
00:01:00,352 --> 00:01:03,897

THAT YOU'RE COMPETING
IN THIS PAGEANT,

34
00:01:06,817 --> 00:01:08,151
BUT I DON'T THINK
YOU SHOULD GET YOUR HOPES UP.

35
00:01:08,235 --> 00:01:09,528
I KNOW;
WINNING IS A LONG SHOT.

36
00:01:09,611 --> 00:01:11,405
IT'S A NO SHOT.

37
00:01:11,488 --> 00:01:12,281
I'VE BEEN COMPETING
IN PAGEANTS

38
00:01:12,364 --> 00:01:13,740
SINCE I WAS 5-YEARS-OLD,

39
00:01:13,824 --> 00:01:16,535
AND I'VE ONLY BEEN
RUNNER-UP TWICE.

40
00:01:16,618 --> 00:01:18,120
YOU'RE NOT GONNA WIN
THIS PAGEANT.

41
00:01:18,203 --> 00:01:20,247
I HAVE AS MUCH CHANCE
AS ANYONE, DON'T I?

42
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:21,623
I MADE IT
TO THE FINALS.

43
00:01:21,707 --> 00:01:23,041
BECAUSE YOU FELL ON STAGE

44
00:01:23,125 --> 00:01:24,418

FELT BAD FOR YOU.

45
00:01:24,501 --> 00:01:25,752
MAYA:
I HAVE TALENT,

46
00:01:25,836 --> 00:01:27,087
AND I CAN ACE
THOSE INTERVIEW QUESTIONS.

00:01:27,171 --> 00:01:28,672
THEY'RE SO EASY,
AND THEY'RE SO...

48
00:01:32,968 --> 00:01:34,928
YOU DON'T THINK
I'M PRETTY ENOUGH.

49
00:01:35,012 --> 00:01:37,097
YOU'RE JUST NOT
THE RIGHT PRETTY.

50
00:01:37,181 --> 00:01:38,390
NOT THAT YOU
AREN'T ADORABLE,

51
00:01:38,473 --> 00:01:40,142
