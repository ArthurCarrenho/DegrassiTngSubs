00:07:13,475 --> 00:07:14,393
YEAH.

179
00:07:15,018 --> 00:07:17,354
OKAY.
THAT'D BE COOL.

180
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:19,940

00:07:24,862 --> 00:07:27,948
IF THERE IS ANY WAY
I CAN DO A MAKE-UP...

184
00:07:28,031 --> 00:07:31,285
C-MINUS.
SHOULD HAVE PREPPED BETTER.

185

QUESTION SIX:

186
00:07:32,202 --> 00:07:34,955
THE "MOLE" IS NOT A RODENT.
IT'S A UNIT OF MEASUREMENT.

187
00:07:35,038 --> 00:07:37,124
I KNOW, I BLANKED.

188
00:07:37,207 --> 00:07:40,377
DO THE WORK, EMMA.

TAKES THE FOCUS OFF CHEM,
I GUESS.

192
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:49,553
CHEM IS TAKING
A BACKSEAT

193
00:07:49,636 --> 00:07:52,097
TO "RULES AND PROCEDURES 101"
THESE DAYS.

194
00:07:52,181 --> 00:07:53,265
DAMIAN:
CHECK THIS OUT.

195
00:07:56,602 --> 00:07:59,438
HEARTBREAKING WORK
OF STAGGERING GENIUS.

196
00:07:59,521 --> 00:08:01,023
QUITE THE ENDORSEMENT.

197
00:08:01,106 --> 00:08:02,357

WOW.

200
00:08:06,987 --> 00:08:07,988
YOU'RE THE FIRST GUY
I'VE MET

201
00:08:08,071 --> 00:08:10,157
WHO EVEN HAS
A FAVOURITE AUTHOR.

202
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:13,327
HIS LIFE GOES HAYWIRE
AND HE JUST... DEALS.

203
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:14,953
I COULD LEARN A THING
OR TWO FROM THAT.

204
00:08:15,037 --> 00:08:16,455
THE WHOLE "DEALING" THING

205
00:08:16,538 --> 00:08:18,749
IS KIND OF ESCAPING ME
AT THE MOMENT.

206
00:08:19,791 --> 00:08:21,043
CALL ME LATER.

207
00:08:21,126 --> 00:08:23,086
I'D LOVE TO HEAR
WHAT YOU THINK OF THE BOOK.

208
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:23,587

215
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:48,403
WHAT? WHY?

216
00:08:48,487 --> 00:08:51,323
SHE STABBED ME,
IN THE HEART.

217
00:08:51,406 --> 00:08:52,616
MAN, SHE DIDN'T STAB
ANYTHING.

218
00:08:52,699 --> 00:08:53,909

219
00:08:53,992 --> 00:08:56,537
YOU'RE NOT THE ONE

I KNOW, BUT... STILL,

222
00:08:59,623 --> 00:09:02,251
YOU SHOULD PREPARE...
MENTALLY,

223
00:09:02,334 --> 00:09:03,585
IN CASE.

224
00:09:03,669 --> 00:09:05,295

I'M THE ONE, MAN.
I'M THE ONE SHE LIKES.

233
00:09:31,488 --> 00:09:32,406

YOU KNOW WHAT?

237
00:09:35,784 --> 00:09:37,786
THE ONLY THING YOU'RE GOOD AT
IS STEALING

238
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:39,413
AND YOU STOLE HER
FROM ME.

239
00:09:39,496 --> 00:09:41,456
'KAY, SHE WAS MINE!

CAN'T WORK WITH THESE
SICKITATING LOVEBIRDS.

248
00:10:02,603 --> 00:10:04,354
WELL, SOUNDS LIKE
YOU'VE GOT A YOKO.

00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:00,719
DEREK:
HEY-OH!

529
00:21:00,802 --> 00:21:03,222
(EXHALES)
COME ON, DUDE.

530
00:21:03,305 --> 00:21:04,890
LOOKS LIKE I GOT
HER BACK FOR YOU.

531
00:21:04,973 --> 00:21:06,266
THAT'S NOT THE POINT,
MAN.

532
00:21:06,350 --> 00:21:07,726
YOU CAN'T JUST SELL ME OUT
TO SOME RACIST

533
00:21:07,809 --> 00:21:09,770
THE SECOND YOU GET MAD,
OR JEALOUS.

534
00:21:09,853 --> 00:21:12,189
I DIDN'T EVEN REALIZE
IT CAN HAPPEN, OKAY.

535
00:21:12,272 --> 00:21:13,065
I SWEAR.

536
00:21:13,148 --> 00:21:16,235
SO YOU WERE JUST BEING
A JACKASS?

537
00:21:16,318 --> 00:21:18,362
GUESS I GOTTA WAKE UP
AND SMELL THE BIGOTRY.

538
00:21:18,445 --> 00:21:19,446
YEAH, NO KIDDING.

539
00:21:21,114 --> 00:21:22,866
C'MON, MAN,
WHAT MORE DO WANT?

540
00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:25,619
HERE.
FREE SHOT. C'MON.

541
00:21:25,702 --> 00:21:28,747
THAT'S NOT GOOD ENOUGH,
MAN.

542
00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:30,832
(HEAVY PUNCH,
DEREK GROANS)

543
00:21:31,959 --> 00:21:33,335
BUT IT'S A START.

544
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:36,713
(RELIEVED EXHALE)
