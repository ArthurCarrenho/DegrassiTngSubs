MUST BE THE GAY THING.

405
00:17:44,022 --> 00:17:45,566
OH, REALLY.

406
00:17:45,649 --> 00:17:49,319
IS THE "GAY THING"
GONNA BE A PROBLEM?

407
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:51,405
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

408

(SNORTED LAUGH)
WHAT'S THIS ALL ABOUT?

413
00:18:02,082 --> 00:18:04,585
IT'S ABOUT BUILDING
A RELATIONSHIP.

(CHUCKLES)

415
00:18:06,670 --> 00:18:09,089
IT'S NOT A RELATIONSHIP,
MARCO.

416
00:18:09,173 --> 00:18:11,675
YOU'RE JUST MY ROOMMATE.

417
