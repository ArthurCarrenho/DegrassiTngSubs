"THE STONE ANGEL."

411
00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:39,648
MAYBE YOU COULD START

412
00:15:39,731 --> 00:15:41,733

UM...

415
00:15:46,113 --> 00:15:48,240
THE MOST PREVAILING THEME
IN THIS BOOK

416
00:15:48,323 --> 00:15:49,741
IS THAT OF PRIDE,

417
00:15:50,367 --> 00:15:54,121
AND THAT'S SEEN THROUGH
THE PROTAGONIST, HAGAR.

443
00:16:48,509 --> 00:16:50,677

I KNOW,

506
00:19:25,582 --> 00:19:28,252
IT WAS SO TOTALLY
UNPROFESSIONAL.

507
00:19:28,335 --> 00:19:29,545
BUT I'VE LEARNED THAT

508
00:19:29,628 --> 00:19:33,048
NO MATTER WHAT I HAVE TO DO
AT THIS JOB,

509
00:19:33,131 --> 00:19:34,508
IT'S COMPLETELY WORTH IT.

535
00:20:41,867 --> 00:20:43,243
YOU WERE JUST TRYING
TO MAKE ME HAPPY,

536
00:20:43,327 --> 00:20:44,494
I DUMPED ALL OVER YOU
FOR IT.

537
00:20:44,578 --> 00:20:47,122
I'M REALLY, REALLY SORRY.

538
00:20:49,374 --> 00:20:50,292
I SCREWED UP TOO.

539
00:20:50,375 --> 00:20:51,919
I WAS TRYING TO BE
YOUR CHEERLEADER

540
00:20:52,002 --> 00:20:55,380
AND I SHOULD'VE
JUST LET YOU CHILL.

541
00:20:56,673 --> 00:20:58,300
I REALIZED SOMETHING OUT THERE
IN THE RAVINE.

542
00:20:58,383 --> 00:21:01,220
UM, LOOKING
INSIDE YOURSELF...

543
00:21:02,888 --> 00:21:04,473
REALLY SUCKS.

544
00:21:07,643 --> 00:21:10,395
I REALIZED
SOMETHING ELSE TOO.

545
00:21:13,148 --> 00:21:14,483
THAT I LIKE YOU.

546
00:21:17,569 --> 00:21:19,071
I REALLY LIKE YOU.

547
00:21:22,241 --> 00:21:23,492
I LIKE YOU TOO.

548
00:21:25,994 --> 00:21:26,411
COOL.

549
00:21:28,288 --> 00:21:29,873
ONE MORE THING.

550
00:21:29,957 --> 00:21:37,297
