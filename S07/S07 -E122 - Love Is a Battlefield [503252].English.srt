525
00:20:52,628 --> 00:20:53,962
I'M SORRY.

526
00:20:55,339 --> 00:20:58,550
I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE
GOOD FOR YOU HERE.

527
00:20:58,634 --> 00:20:59,551
YEAH,

528
00:21:00,302 --> 00:21:02,638
BUT I WAS STILL ALONE.

529
00:21:03,305 --> 00:21:06,308
I LOST YOU
TO A FANTASY WORLD.

530
00:21:07,518 --> 00:21:10,521
THIS IS THE RIGHT
THING TO DO.

531
00:21:11,063 --> 00:21:13,148
BUT IT STILL HURTS.

532
00:21:17,402 --> 00:21:19,947
YOU MAKE IT SOUND
LIKE COUGH SYRUP.

533
00:21:20,030 --> 00:21:21,323

534
00:21:26,954 --> 00:21:27,996
