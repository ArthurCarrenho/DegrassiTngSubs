00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:52,893
CAN'T... BREATHE, SIR.

355
00:14:52,976 --> 00:14:53,644
(CHOKING)

356
00:15:00,275 --> 00:15:01,276
(SIGHS)

357
00:15:03,946 --> 00:15:05,322
YOU OKAY?

358
00:15:05,405 --> 00:15:07,824
I'M FINE.
ALL THANKS TO TOBY.

359
00:15:09,743 --> 00:15:10,911
SIMPSON:
GOOD.

360
00:15:12,287 --> 00:15:14,790
AND NOW FOR SPEECH NUMBER TWO.

361
00:15:16,542 --> 00:15:18,627
HI, I'M LIBERTY VAN ZANDT.

362
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:20,838
THIS SHOULD BE A CONTEST
BETWEEN EQUALS,

363
00:15:20,921 --> 00:15:23,340
BUT THE TRUTH ABOUT
DAMIAN HAYNES IS...

364
00:15:23,423 --> 00:15:25,509
(POWER WHIRS AND SHUTS DOWN)

365
00:15:25,592 --> 00:15:26,969
SIMPSON:
OH...

366
00:15:27,052 --> 00:15:29,304
GREAT. IT'S ANOTHER BLACKOUT.

367
00:15:29,388 --> 00:15:30,597
WELL, GUESS WE'LL FINISH THIS,

368
00:15:30,681 --> 00:15:33,934
OH, WHENEVER WE CONSERVE
ENOUGH ENERGY.

369
00:15:34,017 --> 00:15:36,395
ERIC:
MARCO, YOU READY TO GO?

370
00:15:38,814 --> 00:15:41,650
TALK TO HIM,
FOR ME, PLEASE?

371
00:15:45,112 --> 00:15:46,113
HI.

372
00:15:47,614 --> 00:15:49,366
I KNOW I'M PROBABLY
THE LAST PERSON

373
00:15:49,449 --> 00:15:50,534
YOU WANNA TALK TO
RIGHT NOW.

374
00:15:50,617 --> 00:15:52,286
WHY WOULD YOU SAY THAT,
BOSS?

375
00:15:53,328 --> 00:15:55,789
OKAY, I KNOW THIS DIDN'T GO
HOW WE EXPECTED.

376
00:15:55,873 --> 00:15:58,625
BUT WITHOUT YOU,
THE CORE WOULD BE LOST.

377
00:15:58,709 --> 00:16:00,502
SAY YOU'LL BE MY NUMBER 2?

378
00:16:01,503 --> 00:16:04,798
I THINK THIS WENT EXACTLY
HOW YOU EXPECTED IT TO GO.

379
00:16:04,882 --> 00:16:06,800
I KNOW HOW YOU OPERATE,
ELLIE.

380
00:16:06,884 --> 00:16:08,719
ERIC.
I BEG YOUR PARDON?

381
00:16:08,802 --> 00:16:10,220
LOOK, HER PLAN

382
00:16:10,304 --> 00:16:12,264
WAS CLEARLY BETTER
THAN MINE.

383
00:16:12,347 --> 00:16:14,308
OKAY, ALL I GAVE JESSE
WAS WHAT,

384
00:16:14,391 --> 00:16:17,895
THREE YEARS OF HARD WORK,
RIGHT?

385
00:16:17,978 --> 00:16:19,897
ENJOY YOUR 2-BEDROOM,
MARCO.

386
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:21,064
MARCO:
ERIC?!

387
00:16:24,776 --> 00:16:28,030
I'M SORRY, EL,
HE'S MY BOYFRIEND.

388
00:16:31,867 --> 00:16:32,910
(SIGH OF DISBELIEF)

389
00:16:34,411 --> 00:16:35,412
RADIO DJ:
THAT'S ALL THE INFORMATION
WE HAVE...

390
00:16:35,495 --> 00:16:36,538
(TURNS RADIO OFF)

391
00:16:36,622 --> 00:16:38,290
WELL, IT LOOKS LIKE
IT'S GONNA BE AWHILE

392
00:16:38,373 --> 00:16:40,626
BEFORE THE POWER'S BACK.

393
00:16:40,709 --> 00:16:42,419
RENDERING THIS CLASS
SOMEWHAT POINTLESS.

394
00:16:42,503 --> 00:16:43,337
HEH. UM...

395
00:16:44,546 --> 00:16:45,589
MR. SIMPSON,

396
00:16:45,672 --> 00:16:48,926
I REALLY THINK THE SPEECHES
SHOULD BE SEEN IN TANDEM.

397
00:16:49,009 --> 00:16:50,844
I COULD DO MINE ORALLY.

398
00:16:50,928 --> 00:16:53,597
WELL, WHAT ABOUT THE GRADE 12S
IN OTHER CLASSES?

399
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:54,973
TOBY COULD RECORD IT
ON HIS PHONE,

400
00:16:55,057 --> 00:16:56,808
PODCAST IT LATER?

401
00:16:56,892 --> 00:16:58,268
DAMIAN, IS THAT OKAY?

402
00:16:58,352 --> 00:16:59,853
YEAH, SURE.

403
00:16:59,937 --> 00:17:01,605
SIMPSON:
OKAY.

404
00:17:04,358 --> 00:17:05,526
IS THERE ENOUGH LIGHT?

405
00:17:05,609 --> 00:17:07,194
UM...

406
00:17:07,277 --> 00:17:08,153
YEAH.

407
00:17:08,237 --> 00:17:11,365
THE TRUTH ABOUT
DAMIAN HAYNES IS...

408
00:17:11,448 --> 00:17:13,408
EVEN THOUGH HE DIDN'T ALWAYS
ATTEND DEGRASSI,

409
00:17:13,492 --> 00:17:16,453
HE'S MORE THAN WORTHY
OF SPEAKING ON OUR BEHALF.

410
00:17:16,537 --> 00:17:19,122
I'VE WANTED TO BE VALEDICTORIAN
MY ENTIRE HIGH SCHOOL CAREER,

411
00:17:19,206 --> 00:17:20,916
BUT... SO HAS DAMIAN.

412
00:17:22,584 --> 00:17:24,503
AND SO I'D HONOUR
EITHER CHOICE.

413
00:17:25,462 --> 00:17:28,715
MARCO:
I JUST TALKED ERIC OFF A LEDGE
FOR THE LAST TWO HOURS.

414
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:30,884
HE FEELS LIKE ASS
ABOUT WHAT HE SAID TO YOU.

415
00:17:30,968 --> 00:17:33,679
ELLIE:
IT'S A GOOD THING
MY BEST FRIEND DEFENDED ME.

416
00:17:33,762 --> 00:17:36,598
OH! OH NO, WAIT,
YOU TOTALLY DIDN'T.

417
00:17:36,682 --> 00:17:40,477
I CAN'T ALWAYS BE YOUR KNIGHT
IN SHINING ARMOUR, EL.

418
00:17:40,561 --> 00:17:42,646
LOOK, WE ARE JUST FRIENDS,
NOTHING MORE.

419
00:17:42,729 --> 00:17:43,730
WHOA!

420
00:17:44,273 --> 00:17:46,608
MARCO, WE JUST KISSED.

421
00:17:46,692 --> 00:17:49,403
IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL.
WATCH.

422
00:17:52,865 --> 00:17:53,991
EW.

423
00:17:54,074 --> 00:17:57,411
YEAH, THAT WAS WEIRD,
AND BACON-Y?

424
00:17:57,911 --> 00:18:01,582
(STAMMERING)
IT IS A BIG DEAL, ELLIE.

425
00:18:01,665 --> 00:18:03,625
WE ALMOST CROSSED
THE LINE.

426
00:18:03,709 --> 00:18:04,751
SO WHAT?

427
00:18:04,835 --> 00:18:07,045
THEN WE STOPPED,
AND THEN WE WENT TO SLEEP.

428
00:18:07,129 --> 00:18:08,380
WHY IS THIS A CRISIS?

429
00:18:08,463 --> 00:18:11,884
BECAUSE I AL-
I ALMOST DIDN'T STOP!

430
00:18:14,970 --> 00:18:16,388
PART OF ME
DIDN'T WANT TO.

431
00:18:16,471 --> 00:18:19,183
ELLIE:
AND PART OF ME...

432
00:18:19,266 --> 00:18:21,351
DIDN'T WANT YOU TO.

433
00:18:24,104 --> 00:18:25,105
OKAY, I CAN LEAVE.

434
00:18:26,273 --> 00:18:30,027
WE ARE TOTALLY DEPENDENT
ON EACH OTHER, EL,

435
00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:32,029
FOR EVERYTHING.

436
00:18:32,112 --> 00:18:34,239
EVEN FOR INTIMACY.

437
00:18:34,323 --> 00:18:34,948
IT'S HURTING US;

438
00:18:35,032 --> 00:18:38,535
IT'S HURTING
OUR REAL RELATIONSHIPS.

439
00:18:39,786 --> 00:18:43,457
(TEARY)
THEN I GUESS
WE'RE MOVING OUT.

440
00:18:52,591 --> 00:18:54,051
I KNOW MANY OF YOU HAVE BEEN
WAITING ANXIOUSLY

441
00:18:54,134 --> 00:18:55,177
FOR THE ANSWER
TO THIS QUESTION.

442
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:58,597
WELL, THE VALEDICTORIAN VOTES
HAVE BEEN COUNTED.

443
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:01,517
CONGRATULATIONS
TO LIBERTY VAN ZANDT!

444
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:02,935
(HUM OF CHATTER)

445
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:06,897
HEY. CONGRATULATIONS.

446
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:07,814
THANKS.

447
00:19:07,898 --> 00:19:09,149
DAMIAN MAY BE
MY BOYFRIEND,

448
00:19:09,233 --> 00:19:11,777
BUT, BETWEEN US,
I VOTED FOR YOU.

449
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:14,279
THANKS, EMMA.
MEANS A LOT.

450
00:19:14,363 --> 00:19:16,532
YEAH, AND IF IT WEREN'T
FOR A BLACKOUT,

451
00:19:16,615 --> 00:19:17,491
A CHOKING FIT,

452
00:19:17,574 --> 00:19:19,284
AND DEGRASSI'S
MOST POPULAR PODCAST...

453
00:19:19,368 --> 00:19:21,620
I GOT IT, TOBES.
I GOT LUCKY.

454
00:19:21,703 --> 00:19:25,374
YES, I'M FEELING
THE REQUISITE GUILT.

455
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:29,461
DAMIAN!

456
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:33,799
I KNOW HOW MUCH THIS MEANT
TO YOU,

457
00:19:33,882 --> 00:19:36,093
AND PERHAPS SIMPSON
WILL BE AMENABLE

458
00:19:36,176 --> 00:19:38,220
TO CO-VALEDICTORIANS?

459
00:19:38,303 --> 00:19:42,432
OH THANKS,
BUT YOU WON FAIR AND SQUARE.

460
00:19:42,516 --> 00:19:46,019
YEAH, I MUST CONFESS.
IT WASN'T FAIR AND SQUARE.

461
00:19:46,103 --> 00:19:47,729
I MADE A REALLY MEAN VIDEO

462
00:19:47,813 --> 00:19:49,815
AND I GOT LUCKY
WITH THE BLACKOUT.

463
00:19:49,898 --> 00:19:51,650
MEAN? ABOUT ME?

464
00:19:52,276 --> 00:19:53,694
I SAID THOSE NICE THINGS
IN CLASS

465
00:19:53,777 --> 00:19:56,822
BECAUSE YOUR CLASSY SPEECH
INSPIRED ME,

466
00:19:56,905 --> 00:19:58,991
BUT I DON'T DESERVE THIS.

467
00:19:59,074 --> 00:20:00,492
NO, YOU DO.

468
00:20:01,785 --> 00:20:02,870
YOU DESERVE IT.

469
00:20:02,953 --> 00:20:07,207
I MEAN YOU'RE A GREAT WOMAN
WHO WILL GIVE A GREAT SPEECH.

470
00:20:07,291 --> 00:20:10,085
I HAVE...
A CONFESSION, TOO.

471
00:20:11,461 --> 00:20:14,006
AT THE DOT,
I WAS FLIRTING.

472
00:20:14,089 --> 00:20:17,426
I LIKE MY GIRLS FEISTY,
AND SMART.

473
00:20:26,018 --> 00:20:27,686
CHRISTMAS DOGS?

474
00:20:27,769 --> 00:20:28,812
UH, NO THANKS,

475
00:20:28,896 --> 00:20:32,482
THAT CLASHES WITH MY UH...
EVERYTHING I STAND FOR.

476
00:20:32,566 --> 00:20:33,483
I CAN'T BELIEVE
I WON'T HEAR

477
00:20:33,567 --> 00:20:35,527
YOUR DAILY FASHION TIPS
ANYMORE.

478
00:20:35,611 --> 00:20:38,488
AND I CAN'T BELIEVE WE LIVED
WITH EACH OTHER FOR A YEAR

479
00:20:38,572 --> 00:20:39,573
WITHOUT A MURDER.

480
00:20:41,116 --> 00:20:42,117
THERE'S STILL TIME.

481
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:45,120
HEY, ROOMIES.

482
00:20:45,204 --> 00:20:46,914
NOT FOR LONG.

483
00:20:46,997 --> 00:20:48,790
THEN WHAT ARE WE?

484
00:20:48,874 --> 00:20:51,793
MAN, I KNEW THIS WAS
GONNA HAPPEN!

485
00:20:51,877 --> 00:20:52,794
WE'RE GONNA GROW APART

486
00:20:52,878 --> 00:20:54,379
AND WE'RE NEVER GONNA
SEE EACH OTHER AGAIN!

487
00:20:54,463 --> 00:20:55,923
OH, HON, GET A GRIP.

488
00:20:56,006 --> 00:20:57,883
MARCO:
NO, I'M SERIOUS.

489
00:20:57,966 --> 00:21:00,886
MAYBE...
MAYBE THIS WAS A BAD IDEA.

490
00:21:00,969 --> 00:21:01,887
COME ON,
WHAT'S SO WRONG

491
00:21:01,970 --> 00:21:03,805
ABOUT LIVING WITH
WEIRDO STRANGERS?

492
00:21:03,889 --> 00:21:05,807
YOU'RE RIDICULOUS.

493
00:21:05,891 --> 00:21:07,893
I THOUGHT ABOUT IT
AND... YOU'RE RIGHT;

494
00:21:07,976 --> 00:21:10,020
I THINK A LITTLE DISTANCE
WILL BE A GOOD THING.

495
00:21:10,103 --> 00:21:11,605
ONLY YOU COULD MAKE
THE RIGHT DECISION

496
00:21:11,688 --> 00:21:12,981
AND THEN FREAK OUT
ABOUT IT.

497
00:21:13,065 --> 00:21:14,900
EXACTLY! THAT'S MY POINT!

498
00:21:14,983 --> 00:21:17,903
WHO IS GONNA TALK ME DOWN
FROM MY NEUROTIC FITS?

499
00:21:17,986 --> 00:21:18,987
ELLIE:
OH MY GOD.

500
00:21:19,071 --> 00:21:20,405
WE HAVE PHONES!

501
00:21:20,489 --> 00:21:22,991
MARCO:
YEAH, WELL, MAKE SURE
THEY'RE CHARGED, OKAY?

502
00:21:23,075 --> 00:21:24,326
ALWAYS CHARGED.

503
00:21:26,662 --> 00:21:28,080
I LOVE YOU GUYS.
