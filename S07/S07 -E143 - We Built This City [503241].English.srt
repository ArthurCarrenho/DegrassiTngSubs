DID YOU EVEN TALK TO DAD
ABOUT THIS?

178
00:07:36,707 --> 00:07:39,334
CAN'T I JUST STAY WITH HIM
AND THE NEW LADY?

179
00:07:39,418 --> 00:07:41,503
I'M SURE YOU CAN GUESS
WHAT HE HAD TO SAY.

180
00:07:41,587 --> 00:07:43,463
I'M SORRY, I TRIED.

IT'S OBVIOUS.

268
00:11:30,774 --> 00:11:33,068
IT WAS A MOMENTARY LAPSE
OF REASON.

269
00:11:33,151 --> 00:11:35,946
THE MORE WE TRIED TO RESIST,
THE MORE EXCITING IT BECAME.

MY PROM NIGHT, PIG!

350
00:15:03,737 --> 00:15:05,405
EVERYBODY OUT.

351
00:15:05,489 --> 00:15:06,490
NOW!

352
00:15:19,044 --> 00:15:20,712
(LOW HUM OF CHATTER)

353
00:15:32,891 --> 00:15:34,560
(LOW HUM OF CHATTER)

354
00:15:46,738 --> 00:15:47,906
MY VALEDICTORIAN SPEECH

355
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:50,993
EMPHASIZES THE IMPORTANCE
OF FRIENDSHIP.

356
00:15:51,076 --> 00:15:52,286
IRONIC.

357
00:15:52,369 --> 00:15:53,745
NICE TIMING.

358
00:15:56,039 --> 00:15:58,292
(INHALES AND EXHALES)

359
00:16:04,548 --> 00:16:06,592
YOU'RE MOVING TO REGINA?!

360
00:16:06,675 --> 00:16:09,511
WELL, MY MOM IS
SO, SO AM I.

361
00:16:09,595 --> 00:16:12,139
YOU CAN'T.
NOT, NOT NOW.

362
00:16:12,222 --> 00:16:14,308
EVERYTHING'S JUST STARTING
TO COME TOGETHER FOR US.

363
00:16:14,391 --> 00:16:16,185
PLEASE, DON'T GO.

364
00:16:16,268 --> 00:16:17,895
WHAT CAN WE DO?
ELOPE?

365
00:16:17,978 --> 00:16:20,314
ELOPE AND GO WHERE?

366
00:16:20,397 --> 00:16:21,857
MY STUPID DIVORCED PARENTS.

367
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:24,860
DARCY:
I WISH YOU COULD GET
DIVORCED FROM THEM.

368
00:16:28,655 --> 00:16:29,656
WAIT.

369
00:16:30,782 --> 00:16:33,744
DARCY,
THERE'S TOTALLY A WAY.

370
00:16:34,661 --> 00:16:37,331
MR. VAN ZANDT'S A LAWYER.
HE'S HERE FOR GRAD.

371
00:16:37,414 --> 00:16:38,749
OKAY, AND...?

372
00:16:40,083 --> 00:16:41,001
I'M GONNA MAKE IT

373
00:16:41,084 --> 00:16:42,753
SO NO ONE CAN TELL ME
WHAT TO DO.

374
00:16:43,754 --> 00:16:45,047
TRUST ME.

375
00:16:51,553 --> 00:16:52,930
(EXCITED CHATTER)

376
00:17:00,938 --> 00:17:03,023
EMMA JUST DUMPED ME.

377
00:17:04,942 --> 00:17:07,736
ANY CHANCE YOU NEED
A PRACTICE AUDIENCE?

378
00:17:07,819 --> 00:17:09,279
WHY BOTHER?

379
00:17:09,363 --> 00:17:12,199
JUST LIKE YOU AND MANNY
AND YOU AND EMMA,

380
00:17:12,282 --> 00:17:15,744
YOU AND I WILL UNDOUBTEDLY
AMOUNT TO NOTHING.

381
00:17:15,827 --> 00:17:19,665
YOU REALLY WANT IT
TO GO DOWN LIKE THIS?

382
00:17:20,916 --> 00:17:24,586
HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO STAND
IN FRONT OF MY FRIENDS -

383
00:17:24,670 --> 00:17:27,256
OH, MY FORMER FRIENDS -

384
00:17:27,339 --> 00:17:30,175
AND TRY TO SUMMARIZE
WHAT SIX YEARS OF FRIENDSHIP

385
00:17:30,259 --> 00:17:32,135
HAS MEANT TO ME?

386
00:17:32,219 --> 00:17:36,139
IF THEY'RE REAL FRIENDS,
THEY'LL UNDERSTAND.

387
00:17:39,017 --> 00:17:40,435
LIBERTY:
ACQUIRING AN EDUCATION

388
00:17:40,519 --> 00:17:43,564
IS ABOUT MORE THAN EARNING
A DIPLOMA.

389
00:17:43,647 --> 00:17:45,816
IT'S ALSO ABOUT YOUR FRIENDS

390
00:17:45,899 --> 00:17:48,193
WHO HAVE SEEN YOU
IN YOUR WORST MOMENTS

391
00:17:48,277 --> 00:17:50,362
AND LOVE YOU JUST THE SAME.

392
00:17:52,155 --> 00:17:56,410
UNFORTUNATELY, ONE FRIEND
DID NOT FINISH THE JOURNEY.

393
00:17:56,493 --> 00:17:59,037
HIS NAME IS
JAMES TIBERIUS YORKE.

394
00:18:03,333 --> 00:18:06,003
IF JT'S DEATH
HAS TAUGHT ME ANYTHING,

395
00:18:06,086 --> 00:18:07,296
IT'S THAT THE WORST MISTAKES

396
00:18:07,379 --> 00:18:10,716
ARE THE ONES YOU NEVER
LEARN FROM.

397
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:11,758
AND ALSO,

398
00:18:11,842 --> 00:18:15,053
TO NEVER EVER
TAKE YOUR FRIENDS FOR GRANTED.

399
00:18:16,763 --> 00:18:18,682
(WELLING UP)
I'M SORRY.

400
00:18:19,683 --> 00:18:22,269

00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:28,609

AN EMOTIONAL TIME

404
00:18:28,692 --> 00:18:30,194
FOR OUR GRADUATES.

405
00:18:45,667 --> 00:18:47,252
ARE YOU OKAY?

406
00:18:49,838 --> 00:18:51,465
I ONLY RUINED THE HAPPIEST
DAY OF OUR LIVES

407
00:18:51,548 --> 00:18:54,384
WITH MY ASININE SELFISHNESS.

408
00:18:55,010 --> 00:18:57,971
I UNDERSTAND IF YOU'RE FURIOUS
WITH ME RIGHT NOW.

409
00:18:58,055 --> 00:19:00,224
I AM... WITH DAMIAN.

410
00:19:01,808 --> 00:19:07,022
I AM NOT READY TO THROW AWAY
SIX YEARS OF OUR FRIENDSHIP.

411
00:19:09,149 --> 00:19:10,317
IT'S LIKE YOU SAID,

412
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:14,780
IT'S ONLY A MISTAKE
IF YOU NEVER LEARN FROM IT.

413

YOU'VE DONE SO MUCH FOR US
AND FOR THE WHOLE SCHOOL,

414

TO BE CUT SOME SLACK.

415
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:22,621
LOTS OF IT.

416
00:19:24,581 --> 00:19:27,251
I DON'T THINK I'VE EVER BEEN
CUT SLACK BEFORE.

417
00:19:28,252 --> 00:19:29,628
DUDE,
I COULD BUNGEE JUMP

418
00:19:29,711 --> 00:19:32,506
WITH ALL THE SLACK
I'VE BEEN CUT.

419
00:19:32,589 --> 00:19:33,841
WANNA HEAD BACK IN THERE?

420
00:19:33,924 --> 00:19:34,925
