THAT'S GREAT.

353
00:17:51,029 --> 00:17:53,615
YOU'RE NOT EVEN GONNA ASK
HOW I GOT IT?

354
00:17:53,699 --> 00:17:56,076
WHAT, TOO MANY GIRLS,
TOO FEW CONDOMS?

355
00:17:56,159 --> 00:17:57,160
OOPS!

356
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:02,082
I WAS BORN HIV POSITIVE.

357
00:18:12,384 --> 00:18:14,261
WHAT IS THIS?

358
00:18:14,344 --> 00:18:16,555
GRIFFIN:
MY MOTHER'S OBITUARY.

359
00:18:16,638 --> 00:18:17,890
SHE WAS A JUNKIE.

360
00:18:17,973 --> 00:18:19,224
TRIED TO STOP
AFTER I WAS BORN,

361
00:18:19,308 --> 00:18:22,728
BUT COULDN'T.
I NEVER EVEN MET HER.

362
00:18:24,479 --> 00:18:25,814
I'M SORRY.

363
00:18:27,065 --> 00:18:28,734
I DIDN'T KNOW.

364
00:18:30,152 --> 00:18:32,529
YOU DIDN'T ASK.

365
00:18:32,613 --> 00:18:33,697
WELL, EVEN IF I HAD,

366
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:35,407
WOULD YOU HAVE HAD
THE GUTS TO TELL ME?

367
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:38,243
I'VE BEEN IN A HEALTHY
SEXUALITY PROGRAM FOR YEARS.

368
00:18:38,327 --> 00:18:40,329
THEY TEACH YOU HOW TO HAVE
THESE CONVERSATIONS,

369
00:18:40,412 --> 00:18:43,415
BUT IT DOESN'T MAKE IT
ANY EASIER.

370
00:18:44,249 --> 00:18:46,251
I AM NOT WRONG TO BE SCARED.

371
00:18:46,335 --> 00:18:47,377
I KNOW.

372
00:18:49,087 --> 00:18:50,672
NEITHER AM I.

373
00:19:00,182 --> 00:19:01,850
(LOW HUM OF CHATTER)

374
00:19:04,937 --> 00:19:05,854
DARCY:
HEY.

375
00:19:08,524 --> 00:19:09,858
'KAY. GO.

376
00:19:11,401 --> 00:19:14,988
FOR THE RECORD,
WHAT YOU DID WAS NOT COOL.

377
00:19:15,072 --> 00:19:17,908
I KNOW.
DARCY, I'M AN IDIOT.

378
00:19:19,451 --> 00:19:20,327
BUT THANKS.

379
00:19:20,410 --> 00:19:22,329
KISSING PETER DID GET
A LITTLE BIT MORE FUN.

380
00:19:23,872 --> 00:19:25,707
HMM. LOOK, UM...

381
00:19:26,208 --> 00:19:28,627
CAN WE MAKE ME LIKE,
A FRIENDSHIP TRAINEE?

382
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:31,964
'CAUSE CLEARLY
I'M AN IGNORAMUS.

383
00:19:32,047 --> 00:19:33,799
WILL YOU HELP ME?

384
00:19:33,882 --> 00:19:35,717
I DON'T KNOW.

385
00:19:35,801 --> 00:19:37,636
WHAT IF I SAY SOMETHING'S
SACRED

386
00:19:37,719 --> 00:19:40,222
AND YOU SAY THAT'S STUPID?
THEN WHAT?

387
00:19:40,305 --> 00:19:42,683
MMM...
ARROW TO THE HEAD?

388
00:19:42,766 --> 00:19:44,017
BOTH:
(LAUGH)

389
00:19:44,101 --> 00:19:45,310
LOOK, I...

390
00:19:45,394 --> 00:19:48,397
I GUESS I WANT A FRIEND
MORE THAN I THOUGHT.

391
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,357
KIND OF A LOT MORE.

392
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:53,360
OKAY, YOU NUTBAR,
WE CAN TRY.

393
00:19:53,443 --> 00:19:54,736
THAT'S RAD.

394
00:19:57,155 --> 00:20:00,492
OKAY, LESSON ONE?
FRIENDS CAN HUG.

395
00:20:02,619 --> 00:20:05,914
PAIGE:
MARCO SAYS YOU'RE LEAVING.

396
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:10,669
YOU SHOULD'VE TOLD ME.

397
00:20:10,752 --> 00:20:11,837
(SIGHS)

398
00:20:14,173 --> 00:20:18,844
THINGS WERE GOING SO WELL.
I DIDN'T WANNA RUIN IT.

399
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:21,680
YOU'D BE SURPRISED
HOW QUICKLY THE TRUTH

400
00:20:21,763 --> 00:20:22,931
MAKES PEOPLE RUN AWAY.

401
00:20:23,015 --> 00:20:25,434
YEAH, WELL, SO DO LIES.

402
00:20:27,102 --> 00:20:31,106
EVERYTHING'S ALWAYS
SO COMPLICATED WITH ME.

403
00:20:31,190 --> 00:20:33,984
THE HIV MAKES EVERYTHING
COMPLICATED.

404
00:20:34,067 --> 00:20:36,820
YOU WEREN'T HONEST
WITH ME.

405
00:20:36,904 --> 00:20:38,906
YOU DIDN'T LET ME CHOOSE.

406
00:20:40,199 --> 00:20:43,118
BUT I'M NOT MAD
YOU HAVE HIV.

407
00:20:44,453 --> 00:20:48,457
YOU KNOW, SOME DAYS,
I FORGET THAT I HAVE IT.

408
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:50,959
I'VE NEVER EVEN BEEN SICK.

409
00:20:51,043 --> 00:20:52,794
THE DRUGS WORK.

410
00:20:55,839 --> 00:20:58,675
WE HAVE A LOT
TO TALK ABOUT.

411
00:21:01,011 --> 00:21:04,097
WHICH'LL BE HARDER
IF YOU GO.

412
00:21:05,015 --> 00:21:07,434
DON'T MOVE OUT,
PLEASE.

413
00:21:11,939 --> 00:21:13,440
IT'S NOT GONNA BE WEIRD
IF I STAY?

414
00:21:13,524 --> 00:21:15,150
(SIGHS)
LET'S BE HONEST,

415
00:21:15,234 --> 00:21:18,320
IT'S GONNA BE WEIRD
EITHER WAY.

416
00:21:19,988 --> 00:21:23,700
BUT I WANT TO TRY
TO WORK THROUGH THIS.

417
00:21:26,245 --> 00:21:27,996
YOU ARE AMAZING.

418
00:21:29,790 --> 00:21:31,583
THIS IS NOTHING.

419
00:21:31,667 --> 00:21:34,086
WAIT 'TIL
YOU GET TO KNOW ME.

420
00:21:34,169 --> 00:21:35,420
(CHUCKLES)
