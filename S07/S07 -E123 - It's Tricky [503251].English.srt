I CAN FIX IT,

178
00:07:44,548 --> 00:07:46,967
JUST... I THINK I HAVE
WHAT I NEED.

179
00:07:49,178 --> 00:07:50,095
OKAY.

180
00:07:50,846 --> 00:07:53,182
I'LL GIVE YOU
SOME HEADSPACE.

181
00:07:53,265 --> 00:07:55,767
I CAN'T WAIT
TO HEAR IT.

182
00:08:00,522 --> 00:08:02,316
HATZILAKOS:
IT'S TALENT TIME, DEGRASSI!

183
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:03,901
BRING YOUR LUNCH
TO THE GYMNASIUM

184
00:08:03,984 --> 00:08:05,819
FOR OUR TALENT SHOWCASE.

185
00:08:07,362 --> 00:08:08,280
WOW.

186
00:08:08,363 --> 00:08:09,990
THAT SAV GUY
SURE IS HOT!

187
00:08:10,073 --> 00:08:12,701
NO, MANNY,
I CALLED HIM!

188
00:08:12,784 --> 00:08:13,160
DON'T WORRY,

189
00:08:13,243 --> 00:08:15,120
I DON'T GO AFTER
TENTH GRADERS.

190
00:08:15,204 --> 00:08:17,039
SO, ARE YOU GONNA
TALK TO HIM?

191
00:08:17,122 --> 00:08:18,916
IT JUST SEEMS SOON,

192
00:08:18,999 --> 00:08:21,585
AFTER MY LAST
BOYFRIEND.

193
00:08:21,668 --> 00:08:23,337
MIA,
THE PAST IS THE PAST.

194
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:24,505
CARPE DIEM.

195
00:08:24,588 --> 00:08:26,256
SEIZE THE SAV.

196
00:08:27,049 --> 00:08:27,925
MANY HAVE TRIED,

197
00:08:28,008 --> 00:08:29,301
NONE HAVE SUCCEEDED.

198
00:08:29,384 --> 00:08:31,803
ESPECIALLY ONES
WITH BABY WEIGHT.

199
00:08:31,887 --> 00:08:32,513
NOW, WHAT WOULD I DO

200
00:08:32,596 --> 00:08:36,016
WITHOUT HOLLY J. SINCLAIR
LOOKING OUT FOR ME?

201
00:08:36,099 --> 00:08:36,850
HOLD ON.

202
00:08:36,934 --> 00:08:38,644
HOLLY J. SINCLAIR?

203
00:08:38,727 --> 00:08:41,230
AS IN
HEATHER SINCLAIR?

204
00:08:41,313 --> 00:08:42,272
SHE'S MY SISTER.

205
00:08:42,356 --> 00:08:43,690
WAIT,
THE BOYFRIEND-STEALING,

206
00:08:43,774 --> 00:08:45,067
BAD NOSE JOB-HAVING,

207
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:46,693
PUPPY-DROWNING
QUEEN OF EVIL,

208
00:08:46,777 --> 00:08:48,487
IS YOUR SISTER?

209
00:08:49,071 --> 00:08:52,115
TAUGHT ME EVERYTHING
SHE KNOWS.

210
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:58,747
THIS MAY BE A PROBLEM,
SWEETIE.

211
00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:00,165
WHAT? WHY?

212
00:09:00,832 --> 00:09:02,709
LISTEN, I HAVE TO DEBATE HER
TOMORROW MORNING,

213
00:09:02,793 --> 00:09:04,002
TELL ME EVERYTHING.

214
00:09:04,086 --> 00:09:05,587
LET'S JUST SAY
IF HOLLY J AND HEATHER

215
00:09:05,671 --> 00:09:07,214
SHARE THE SAME DNA?

216
00:09:07,297 --> 00:09:08,257
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
TO FIGHT FIRE

217
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:11,593
WITH HUGE,
ENORMOUS FLAMES.

218
00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:14,680
GOT A LIGHT?

219
00:09:14,763 --> 00:09:15,597

HEY, BEAUTIFUL.

230
00:09:33,448 --> 00:09:37,119
DID YOU WORK OUT
THE TONAL ISSUES?

231
00:09:37,202 --> 00:09:38,203
I, UM...

232
00:09:39,162 --> 00:09:41,665
I WENT WITH
AN EARLIER VERSION.

233
00:09:41,748 --> 00:09:43,917
SO IT'S A SOLO
PROJECT?

234
00:09:44,001 --> 00:09:47,421
IT'S NOT THAT
YOUR RAP WAS BAD,

235
00:09:47,504 --> 00:09:49,840
IT JUST DIDN'T
REALLY FIT.

236
00:09:49,923 --> 00:09:51,592
YOU'RE RIGHT.

237
00:09:51,675 --> 00:09:53,427

SO TO THIS DAY, YOU KNOW
THAT IT IS NEVER BEHIND.

270

I'M AHEAD OF THE REST

AND I DIDN'T NEED IT-

288
00:11:53,130 --> 00:11:55,966
JIMMY,
ALL THEY SAW WAS YOU.

289
00:12:00,971 --> 00:12:01,388

BUT...

304
00:12:46,308 --> 00:12:47,893
PEOPLE THOUGHT
I WAS CRAIG'S SIDEKICK.

305
00:12:47,976 --> 00:12:49,102
I DON'T WANNA BE JIMMY'S.

306
00:12:49,186 --> 00:12:51,438
DOES THAT MAKE ME
A BITCH?

THESE BENEFITS,

339
00:14:04,428 --> 00:14:05,345
I INTEND TO PROVE...

350
00:14:31,788 --> 00:14:35,334
JIMMY, YOU SAW
THE AUDIENCE YESTERDAY.

351
00:14:35,417 --> 00:14:36,793
I CAN TAKE THE HINT.

352
00:14:36,877 --> 00:14:38,295
I'M NOT A PERFORMER
LIKE YOU.
