350
00:16:03,005 --> 00:16:05,883
I WILL BE COVERING FOR HIM
AGAIN.

351
00:16:05,966 --> 00:16:07,342
EMMA:
WHAT'S GOING ON?

352
00:16:07,426 --> 00:16:08,177
WHERE IS HE?

353
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:09,720
PERINO:
I DON'T ASK QUESTIONS.

354
00:16:09,803 --> 00:16:11,805
SO, I BELIEVE WE HAVE WHAT?
PHOTO ESSAYS,

355
00:16:11,889 --> 00:16:14,808
ACCORDING TO MR. SIMPSON'S
LESSON PLAN NUMBER 117.

356
00:16:14,892 --> 00:16:16,810
(HUM OF STUDENTS CHATTERING)

357
00:16:16,894 --> 00:16:19,688
NEVER FORGET
I'M A GENIUS, ANYA.

358
00:16:19,771 --> 00:16:20,606
WOW!

359
00:16:20,689 --> 00:16:22,441
SURE LOOKS LIKE
THAT TUTORING PAID OFF.

360
00:16:22,524 --> 00:16:25,068
YOU'RE LIKE THE TOBY
OF OUR CLASS.

361
00:16:25,152 --> 00:16:27,070
ANYA, DO YOU REALIZE
HOW DUMB

362
00:16:27,154 --> 00:16:29,573
SOME OF THE THINGS
YOU SAY ARE?

363
00:16:29,656 --> 00:16:31,200
SORRY.
YOU'RE NOTHING LIKE TOBY.

364
00:16:31,283 --> 00:16:32,701
HE'S DISGUSTING.

365
00:16:32,784 --> 00:16:35,078
(SIGHS)
OH, ANYA.

366
00:16:35,162 --> 00:16:36,246
HE'S NOT DISGUSTING.
HE'S...

367
00:16:38,248 --> 00:16:39,583
GEEK CHIC.

368
00:16:40,334 --> 00:16:42,586
HE MIGHT BE RICH ONE DAY,
LIKE BILL GATES.

369
00:16:42,669 --> 00:16:45,964
OKAY, SO WE LIKE HIM...
NOW THEN?

370
00:16:46,048 --> 00:16:47,758
TRY TO KEEP UP,
ANYA.

371
00:16:47,841 --> 00:16:49,635
WE MIGHT LIKE HIM,
YES.

372
00:16:49,718 --> 00:16:50,719
OKAY.

HE'S GOT TWO-THIRDS
OF THE SECOND PLACE...

376
00:17:02,189 --> 00:17:03,941
PERFECT!
DON'T GO TO WORK.

377
00:17:04,024 --> 00:17:05,651
STAY HOME AND GET WASTED!

378
00:17:05,734 --> 00:17:07,110
AND WATCH CARS
SMASH INTO EACH OTHER.

379
00:17:07,194 --> 00:17:08,195
IT'S AWESOME.

380
00:17:09,696 --> 00:17:11,031
YOU'RE A COWARD.

381
00:17:12,032 --> 00:17:13,909
(MUTTERING WITH HIS MOUTH FULL)

382
00:17:13,992 --> 00:17:15,452
THIS MORNING,

383
00:17:15,536 --> 00:17:17,371
I GOT UP AND GRABBED MY LAPTOP
AND I TIRED -

384
00:17:17,454 --> 00:17:18,956
BECAUSE YOU WANTED ME TO -

385
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:20,457
AND I COULDN'T EVEN GET OUT
THE DOOR.

386
00:17:20,541 --> 00:17:22,543
WHAT IF MOM SEES YOU
LIKE THIS?

387
00:17:22,626 --> 00:17:25,087
WELL, MAYBE SHE NEEDS TO.
HM?

388
00:17:25,170 --> 00:17:27,965
FINE.
WALLOW IN SELF-PITY.

389
00:17:28,048 --> 00:17:29,466
YOU KNOW, WHEN BAD THINGS
HAPPEN TO ME,

390
00:17:29,550 --> 00:17:30,467
YOU TELL ME TO BE STRONG.

391
00:17:30,551 --> 00:17:32,302
BUT YOU'RE NOT STRONG,

392
00:17:32,386 --> 00:17:33,887
YOU'RE A HYPOCRITE.

393
00:17:33,971 --> 00:17:35,806
MAYBE. I'M SORRY.

394
00:17:35,889 --> 00:17:36,723

395
00:17:36,807 --> 00:17:38,225
SPIKE:
ARCHIE?

396
00:17:41,895 --> 00:17:43,105
WHAT IS THIS?

397
00:17:43,188 --> 00:17:44,898
IT'S FINE, MOM.

398
00:17:46,066 --> 00:17:47,568
ARE YOU DRUNK?

399
00:17:47,651 --> 00:17:50,779
I'M SORRY,
I FAILED YOU GUYS.

400
00:17:50,863 --> 00:17:52,823
YOU DIDN'T FAIL.
YOU GAVE UP.

401
00:17:52,906 --> 00:17:55,492
TRYING TO RUN AWAY
FROM YOUR PROBLEMS.

402
00:17:55,576 --> 00:17:56,869
THE KIDS SHOULDN'T SEE THIS.

403
00:17:57,911 --> 00:17:58,996
LOOK, I'LL BE FINE,
CHRISTINE, OKAY?

404
00:17:59,079 --> 00:17:59,997
I JUST NEEDED A DAY
TO GET MY HEAD ON STR...

00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:03,000
(BOWL CLATTERS)

406
00:18:03,083 --> 00:18:04,376
(EGGERS WHINES)

407
00:18:05,752 --> 00:18:07,504
I THINK THE KIDS AND I
SHOULD GO STAY WITH MY MOM

408
00:18:07,588 --> 00:18:09,173
FOR A WHILE.

409
00:18:09,256 --> 00:18:11,091
MOM, DON'T OVERREACT.

410
00:18:11,175 --> 00:18:12,676
SPIKE:
EMMA, I'M YOUR MOTHER,

411
00:18:12,759 --> 00:18:16,597
AND BEING AROUND THIS...
THIS ENVIRONMENT,

412
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:18,557
I JUST THINK WE MIGHT NEED
SOME TIME AWAY.

413
00:18:31,111 --> 00:18:34,114
(STUDENTS CHATTER,
BUS RUMBLES PAST)

414
00:18:37,618 --> 00:18:39,161
WELL, MY TEST
WAS A SUCCESS,

415
00:18:39,244 --> 00:18:42,164
ALL THANKS
TO MY SUPER TUTOR.

416
00:18:43,457 --> 00:18:45,959
A LITTLE PRIVACY FROM
YOUR MAN-MADE FIBRES, PLEASE?

417
00:18:46,043 --> 00:18:48,212
MY PLEASURE.
I'LL LET YOU GUYS "TALK".

418
00:18:50,797 --> 00:18:51,882
LISTEN,

419
00:18:51,965 --> 00:18:54,009
WE CAN BE SEEN TOGETHER;
IT'S OUT IN THE OPEN.

420
00:18:54,092 --> 00:18:55,385
SOME PEOPLE THINK
I'M KIND OF A LOSER,

421
00:18:55,469 --> 00:18:57,721
AND UNTIL - WHAT? -
LIKE TEN SECONDS AGO,

422
00:18:57,804 --> 00:18:59,306
WEREN'T YOU ONE OF THEM?

423
00:18:59,389 --> 00:19:00,807
WELL, I CHANGED MY MIND.

424
00:19:00,891 --> 00:19:03,268
LOWERED MY STANDARDS
'CAUSE I LIKE YOU.

(INCREDULOUS LAUGH)
WRONG ANSWER, HOLLY J.

426
00:19:07,231 --> 00:19:08,982
IT WOULD BE SO SWEET
TO HAVE A GIRLFRIEND,

427
00:19:09,066 --> 00:19:12,236
BUT IT JUST CAN'T BE YOU.

428
00:19:12,319 --> 00:19:14,738
NO, YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.
I MADE EVERYTHING OKAY!

429
00:19:14,821 --> 00:19:15,656
I TOLD MY FRIENDS.

430
00:19:15,739 --> 00:19:16,782
I DON'T CARE WHO YOU TOLD.

431
00:19:16,865 --> 00:19:18,283
THIS ISN'T ABOUT YOU,
IT'S ABOUT ME.

432
00:19:18,367 --> 00:19:20,619
AND YOUR POOR
SELF-ESTEEM?

433
00:19:20,702 --> 00:19:22,162
GET OVER IT, TOBY.

434
00:19:22,246 --> 00:19:24,331
IT DOESN'T MATTER
WHAT YOU THINK.

435
00:19:24,414 --> 00:19:28,418
IF PEOPLE SEE YOU WITH ME,
THEY'LL WORSHIP YOU.

436
00:19:28,502 --> 00:19:30,295
NOT THE PEOPLE
I CARE ABOUT.

437
00:19:30,379 --> 00:19:33,048
WHO, LIBERTY?
PLEASE.

438
00:19:33,131 --> 00:19:34,091
LOOK, YOU HAD YOUR SHOT
WITH ME

439
00:19:34,174 --> 00:19:35,217
AND YOU BLEW IT.

440
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:38,136
TOBY ISAACS

441
00:19:47,521 --> 00:19:49,690
ANYA, COME OVER TONIGHT.

442
00:19:49,773 --> 00:19:51,066
I DON'T CARE.
DITCH HIM.

443
00:19:51,149 --> 00:19:52,776
WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT THIS
DISTURBING NEW DEPENDENCE

444
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:53,861
ON BOYS.

445
00:19:56,864 --> 00:19:59,575
DIDN'T EXPECT YOU
TO BE UP.

446
00:19:59,658 --> 00:20:03,203
I'D, UH, WALLOWED IN SELF-PITY
LONG ENOUGH.

447
00:20:03,287 --> 00:20:06,039
SO ARE YOU GONNA
TRY AGAIN?

448
00:20:07,124 --> 00:20:09,376
I DO WANT TO GO BACK,
YOU KNOW.

449
00:20:09,459 --> 00:20:10,961
BUT NOT YET.

450
00:20:13,088 --> 00:20:16,758
I THOUGHT I COULD DO THIS
ON MY OWN, BUT UH...

451
00:20:16,842 --> 00:20:18,552
I CAN'T.

452
00:20:18,635 --> 00:20:21,346
THE UNION HAS COUNSELORS,
SO, UM...

453
00:20:21,430 --> 00:20:23,390
WE'RE GONNA TALK.

454
00:20:27,186 --> 00:20:28,312
WHERE'S YOUR BAG?
COME ON, EM,

455
00:20:28,395 --> 00:20:30,189
PACK YOUR THINGS.
LET'S GO.

456
00:20:30,272 --> 00:20:31,815
I'M NOT GOING.

457
00:20:31,899 --> 00:20:33,066
SIMPSON:
UM...

458
00:20:34,067 --> 00:20:35,569
YOU DON'T HAVE TO STAY,
EMMA.

459
00:20:35,652 --> 00:20:37,738
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN,

460
00:20:37,821 --> 00:20:39,156
BUT I CAN'T JUST STAND BY

461
00:20:39,239 --> 00:20:41,408
AND WATCH OUR FAMILY
FALL APART.

462
00:20:41,491 --> 00:20:43,994
EM, YOU NEED TO TAKE CARE
OF YOURSELF.

463
00:20:44,077 --> 00:20:48,248
I KNOW, YOU'RE WORRIED ABOUT ME
TRYING TO CONTROL THINGS.

464
00:20:48,332 --> 00:20:50,876
BUT THE ONE THING I CAN DO
IS STAY HERE,

465
00:20:50,959 --> 00:20:51,960
AND SO CAN YOU.

466
00:21:01,929 --> 00:21:04,181
I'M SORRY, EMMA,

467
00:21:04,264 --> 00:21:08,185
BUT I NEED TO TAKE CARE
OF MYSELF TOO.

468
00:21:08,268 --> 00:21:10,604
I'LL CALL YOU TONIGHT.

469
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:22,699
YOUR MOM AND I,
WE JUST...

470
00:21:22,783 --> 00:21:24,785
WE NEED SOME TIME.

471
00:21:27,412 --> 00:21:30,290
THANKS FOR STAYING
WITH ME.

472
00:21:30,374 --> 00:21:32,876
I BELIEVE IN YOU,
DAD.

473
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:35,212
DON'T MAKE ME
REGRET IT.
