182
00:07:44,214 --> 00:07:46,133
OH, YOU GOT AN ANGER
MANAGEMENT PROBLEM.

183
00:07:46,216 --> 00:07:48,218
ALL I SAID WAS,
THAT DEGRASSI KID WHO DIED-

JT YORKE.

185
00:07:49,386 --> 00:07:50,888
HIS NAME WAS JT YORKE.

186
00:07:50,971 --> 00:07:52,306
YEAH, HIM.

187
00:07:53,223 --> 00:07:55,726

HE ASKED FOR IT.

AND WE'RE GONNA HAVE
TO GET YOU A CAPE.

204
00:08:40,938 --> 00:08:41,939
RIGHT.

205
00:08:42,439 --> 00:08:44,441
THINK JANE
WAS IMPRESSED?

206
00:08:44,525 --> 00:08:45,526
YEAH, FOR SURE.

207
00:08:45,609 --> 00:08:47,402
SHE'S NOT GONNA BE IMPRESSED
WHEN YOU'RE IN THE ICU.

208
00:08:47,486 --> 00:08:48,487
POINT?

209
00:08:48,987 --> 00:08:51,365
THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG,
THAT'S MY POINT.

210
00:08:51,448 --> 00:08:52,491
AND YOUR THEORY ABOUT
BEING BACKED UP?

211
00:08:52,574 --> 00:08:53,825
IT'S STUPID, OKAY?

212
00:08:53,909 --> 00:08:54,535
YEAH.
YOU'RE STUPID.

213
00:08:54,618 --> 00:08:55,369
SHUT UP.

214
00:08:56,495 --> 00:08:56,870
LOOK, SPIN.

215
00:08:56,954 --> 00:08:59,081
I'VE HAD MY ISSUES
WITH THE JUNKULAR AREA.

216
00:08:59,164 --> 00:09:00,249
IT'S NO FUN.

217
00:09:00,332 --> 00:09:02,543

TO GET IT CHECKED OUT.

218
00:09:02,626 --> 00:09:03,585
I KNOW YOU HATE DOCTORS

THAT'S FINE.
IT'S YOUR CHOICE.

222
00:09:10,259 --> 00:09:11,802
YOU CAN EITHER IGNORE
AN OBVIOUS PROBLEM

223
00:09:11,885 --> 00:09:13,971
OR YOU CAN BE A MAN
AND FACE IT...

MAYBE YOU TWO DON'T CARE
ABOUT YOUR GRADES,

235
00:09:43,125 --> 00:09:46,336
BUT SOME OF US WANT TO STAY
OUT OF THE GUIDANCE OFFICE.

YOU KNOW THE RULES ABOUT
TALKING DURING EXAMS.

237
00:09:48,755 --> 00:09:49,506
AUTOMATIC DETENTION,

238

I WAS JUST TRYING TO STOP
THESE TWO FROM TALKING!

241
00:09:54,761 --> 00:09:55,762
FINE.
YOU CAN KEEP YOUR 20%.

242
00:09:55,846 --> 00:09:58,265
BUT I'LL SEE YOU
IN DETENTION TOMORROW.

243

DON'T PUSH YOUR LUCK.

245
00:10:03,812 --> 00:10:04,479
BITE ME.

YEAH. THAT'S WHAT DOCTORS
ALWAYS SAY.

I TAKE A LOOK.

SWELLING IN THE TESTICLE

HAD THAT LUMP?

274
00:11:39,199 --> 00:11:41,201
I DIDN'T KNOW
I HAD ONE.

275
00:11:41,785 --> 00:11:44,663
YOU DIDN'T NOTICE
ANYTHING ODD?

276
00:11:44,746 --> 00:11:45,539
YEAH. I DID.

277
00:11:45,622 --> 00:11:46,707
BUT I DIDN'T...

278
00:11:47,749 --> 00:11:48,458
WANT TO-

279
00:11:48,542 --> 00:11:50,127
THAT LUMP COULD BE
A NUMBER OF THINGS.

280
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:52,045
A CYST, INFECTION,
TUMOUR.

281

DON'T BE ALARMED.

285
00:11:57,384 --> 00:11:59,386

HEY-HEY MAN!

287
00:12:04,558 --> 00:12:07,477
DID YOU CATCH THE RAPTERS
LAST NIGHT?

288
00:12:07,561 --> 00:12:08,770
HOW ABOUT

WHAT HAPPENED
AT THE DOCTOR'S?

293
00:12:15,652 --> 00:12:16,778
IT WAS A TOTAL
FREAK SHOW, MAN.

294
00:12:16,862 --> 00:12:19,865
THIS LARDASS ATE
A BOX OF DONUTS

295
00:12:19,948 --> 00:12:20,532
REALLY?

296
00:12:20,616 --> 00:12:22,034
AND THEN THERE WAS
THIS OTHER DUDE?

297
00:12:22,117 --> 00:12:25,204
HE REEKED OF ONIONS
AND HORSE PEE.

298
00:12:25,287 --> 00:12:26,705
THAT'S NASTY!

299
00:12:26,788 --> 00:12:30,542
SO THE DOCTOR HAD NOTHING
TO SAY THOUGH?

300
00:12:30,626 --> 00:12:33,045
SHE SAID I COULD
MAYBE POSSIBLY

301
00:12:33,128 --> 00:12:35,631
HAVE CANCER OF THE NUTS.

302
00:12:36,423 --> 00:12:38,258
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

303
00:12:39,176 --> 00:12:41,470
AS SERIOUS AS CANCER.

304
00:12:41,553 --> 00:12:43,055
WHICH I TOTALLY
DON'T HAVE, MAN.

305
00:12:43,138 --> 00:12:46,642
I MEAN, IT COULD BE
A LOT OF THINGS.

306
00:12:47,893 --> 00:12:49,061
YEAH.

307
00:12:49,144 --> 00:12:51,563
WHO GETS CANCER
AT 18 ANYWAY, RIGHT?

308
00:12:51,647 --> 00:12:52,814

309
00:12:56,401 --> 00:12:57,778
OOOPS.

311
00:13:00,072 --> 00:13:01,323
BACK OFF.

312
00:13:02,324 --> 00:13:02,991

313
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:06,203

DARCY:
DON'T TELL ME TO RELAX.

324
00:13:53,125 --> 00:13:54,001
YOU DORKS ARE THE REASON

325
00:13:54,084 --> 00:13:55,335
WHY I AM WASHING WINDOWS

326
00:13:55,419 --> 00:13:57,379

00:13:57,462 --> 00:13:58,547
WE'VE GOT THE FULL DETENTION

328
00:13:58,630 --> 00:14:00,132

331
00:14:08,932 --> 00:14:11,393
IF SHE KNOWS THAT YOU
GOT ME IN TROUBLE?

332
00:14:11,476 --> 00:14:13,020
I LOSE MY FREEDOM.

333
00:14:13,103 --> 00:14:15,230

INTO TROUBLE.

334
00:14:15,314 --> 00:14:16,607

IF SHE COMES OVER HERE,
JUST TELL HER I VOLUNTEER.

336
00:14:18,692 --> 00:14:20,152
PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE.

ON A STRICTLY
VOLUNTEER BASIS.

340
00:14:25,866 --> 00:14:28,577
THE WINDOWS ARE JUST
APPALLINGLY DIRTY.

341
00:14:30,829 --> 00:14:32,831
THIS IS DETENTION
PERIOD.

342
00:14:32,915 --> 00:14:35,209
DARCY WAS ACTING OUT
DURING AN EXAM.

343
00:14:35,292 --> 00:14:35,959
OH.

344
00:14:36,418 --> 00:14:37,711
I GUESS WE'LL HAVE SOMETHING
TO TALK ABOUT

345
00:14:37,794 --> 00:14:39,463
IN OUR NEXT SESSION.

346
00:14:44,301 --> 00:14:45,385
THANKS A LOT.

347
00:14:46,553 --> 00:14:48,055
I'M SORRY,

350
00:15:04,863 --> 00:15:06,031
SPINNER:
I'VE NEVER HUNG OUT
WITH A GIRL

351
00:15:06,114 --> 00:15:07,282
WHO'S SUCH A POOL SHARK.

352
00:15:07,366 --> 00:15:08,367
JANE:
WELL, I GUESS YOU'VE
BEEN HANGING

353
00:15:08,450 --> 00:15:12,162
WITH THE WRONG GIRLS,
DUDE.

354
00:15:16,083 --> 00:15:16,458
OHHH.

355
00:15:19,962 --> 00:15:21,755
SO WHAT DO YOU THINK?

356
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:23,674
COULD HAVE USED
A BIT MORE BACKSPIN.

357
00:15:23,757 --> 00:15:24,883
I MEANT MY NOSE RING.

358
00:15:26,176 --> 00:15:27,302
OH.

359
00:15:27,386 --> 00:15:29,638
IT'S NICE.
I LIKE IT.

360
00:15:34,142 --> 00:15:35,477
YOUR SHOT.

361
00:15:41,149 --> 00:15:41,358
YOU KNOW WHAT?

362
00:15:41,441 --> 00:15:42,901
WHY DON'T YOU TAKE IT?

363
00:15:42,985 --> 00:15:44,069
SEE IF YOU CAN GET IT.

364
00:15:44,152 --> 00:15:45,779
OH, NOT MAN ENOUGH.
IT'S OKAY.

365
00:15:53,871 --> 00:15:55,080
I GOTTA GO!

366
00:15:55,163 --> 00:15:56,498
JANE:
NOW? OKAY.

367
00:16:03,714 --> 00:16:05,132
(HEAVY BREATHING)

368
00:16:24,776 --> 00:16:26,111
JIMMY:
HEY...

369
00:16:26,195 --> 00:16:27,279
THERE'S JANE.

370
00:16:30,908 --> 00:16:32,409
OUCH. COLD.

371
00:16:34,203 --> 00:16:35,579
I WAS ABOUT TO ASK
HOW YOUR NIGHT WENT,

372
00:16:35,662 --> 00:16:37,831
BUT I THINK
I JUST FOUND OUT.

373
00:16:37,915 --> 00:16:39,583
SHE'S NOT MY TYPE.

374
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:41,168
SHE'S NOT YOUR TYPE?

375
00:16:41,251 --> 00:16:42,169
SHE'S YOU WITH BREASTS.

376
00:16:42,252 --> 00:16:43,128
I KNOW.

377
00:16:43,212 --> 00:16:45,714
BUT WHO'D WANT TO BE WITH
A GUY WHOSE STUFF IS -

378
00:16:45,797 --> 00:16:47,466
MALFUNCTIONED!

379
00:16:51,011 --> 00:16:53,347
JIMMY, I DIDN'T MEAN-

380
00:16:53,430 --> 00:16:54,640
SORRY.

381
00:16:54,723 --> 00:16:55,766
(PHONE RINGS)

382
00:16:58,810 --> 00:16:59,394
GREAT!

383
00:17:00,854 --> 00:17:02,105
IT'S THE DOC.

384
00:17:04,316 --> 00:17:05,651
SPIN, YOU GOTTA DEAL
WITH THIS.

385
00:17:07,110 --> 00:17:07,778
I CAN'T.

386
00:17:08,779 --> 00:17:09,530
DON'T YOU GET IT?

387
00:17:09,613 --> 00:17:11,823
I CAN'T HAVE
THAT DISEASE, MAN.

388
00:17:11,907 --> 00:17:13,951
WHEN MY DAD GOT IT?

389
00:17:15,744 --> 00:17:17,371
HE DIDN'T HAVE A CHANCE.

390
00:17:17,454 --> 00:17:18,497
THAT WAS LUNG CANCER.

391
00:17:18,580 --> 00:17:19,248
SO?!

392
00:17:19,831 --> 00:17:22,584
NOTHING THE DOCTORS DID
WORKED, MAN.

393
00:17:22,668 --> 00:17:23,752
IT WAS A DEATH SENTENCE.

394
00:17:34,555 --> 00:17:35,848
MS. SAUVE SAID
I HAVE TO APOLOGIZE

395
00:17:35,931 --> 00:17:37,182
FOR TOSSING THE WATER,

396
00:17:37,266 --> 00:17:38,809
SO - SORRY.

397
00:17:38,892 --> 00:17:39,685
WELL, HOW ABOUT YOU
SAY IT AGAIN

398
00:17:39,768 --> 00:17:42,187
AND ACTUALLY MEAN IT
THIS TIME?

399
00:17:42,271 --> 00:17:45,148
I DON'T MEAN IT,
MR. SIMPSON!

400
00:17:45,232 --> 00:17:46,733
YOU COULD'VE HELPED ME
AND YOU DIDN'T!

401
00:17:46,817 --> 00:17:48,694
NOW I'M BACK IN STUPID
COUNSELLING

402
00:17:48,777 --> 00:17:49,987
THREE TIMES A WEEK!

403
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:52,364
DARCY, IF YOU'RE
ON SUICIDE WATCH?

404
00:17:52,447 --> 00:17:55,200
THEN MAYBE THAT'S
NOT SUCH A BAD IDEA.

405
00:17:55,284 --> 00:17:57,578
I HATE COUNSELLING!

406
00:17:57,661 --> 00:17:58,704
OKAY?
I HATE IT!

407
00:17:58,787 --> 00:17:59,413
WHY?

408
00:18:00,122 --> 00:18:02,082
BECAUSE SHE'S TRYING
TO GET INSIDE MY MIND.

409
00:18:02,165 --> 00:18:03,458
SHE WANTS TO KNOW THINGS!

410
00:18:03,542 --> 00:18:05,043
LOOK, WHATEVER IT IS
YOU'RE COPING WITH,

411
00:18:05,127 --> 00:18:06,587
LASHING OUT ISN'T THE WAY
TO DEAL WITH IT.

412
00:18:06,670 --> 00:18:08,714
AND UNLESS YOU CONTROL
YOURSELF AND STOP ACTING OUT-

413
00:18:08,797 --> 00:18:10,299
I WAS RAPED!

414
00:18:23,854 --> 00:18:25,063
SPINNER:
MOM...

415
00:18:25,147 --> 00:18:27,232
WHATEVER HAPPENS,
WE'LL GET THROUGH IT.

416
00:18:27,316 --> 00:18:28,984
IT'LL BE OKAY.

417
00:18:37,868 --> 00:18:41,371
WELL, I'LL START
WITH THE GOOD NEWS.

418
00:18:42,247 --> 00:18:45,542
IT LOOKS LIKE WE'VE CAUGHT
THIS VERY EARLY.

419
00:18:45,626 --> 00:18:48,462
CAUGHT...
WHAT EXACTLY, DOC?

420
00:18:49,546 --> 00:18:51,381
GAVIN, I'M SORRY.

421
00:18:51,465 --> 00:18:53,467
YOU HAVE TESTICULAR
CANCER.

422
00:18:53,550 --> 00:18:55,219
NOW I KNOW
IT'S QUITE A SHOCK

423
00:18:55,302 --> 00:18:56,178
FOR A MAN AS YOUNG
AS YOURSELF

424
00:18:56,261 --> 00:18:57,596
BUT I WANT TO ASSURE YOU

425
00:18:57,679 --> 00:18:59,890
THAT TESTICULAR CANCER IS ONE
OF THE MOST TREATABLE

426
00:18:59,973 --> 00:19:00,891
FORMS OF CANCER.

427
00:19:00,974 --> 00:19:03,519
WITH FULL REMISSION
IN NEARLY 90% OF THE CASES.

428
00:19:03,602 --> 00:19:05,187
I'M GONNA BOOK YOU
AN APPOINTMENT

429
00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:06,522
AT THE HOSPITALS
ONCOLOGY UNIT,

430
00:19:06,605 --> 00:19:08,649
WHERE YOU'LL DECIDE
ON YOUR COURSE OF TREATMENT

431
00:19:08,732 --> 00:19:11,818
BUT UNTIL THEN
IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS...

432
00:19:25,541 --> 00:19:29,586
I THINK YOU AND I NEED
TO GO SEE MS. SAUVE.

433
00:19:30,379 --> 00:19:32,714
TELL HER
WHAT YOU TOLD ME.

434
00:19:32,798 --> 00:19:36,134
I'M NOT READY
TO TELL ANYONE ELSE.

435
00:19:44,476 --> 00:19:45,477
CAN I SIT?

436
00:19:59,616 --> 00:20:00,868
I FEEL LIKE I MIGHT
HAVE BEEN

437
00:20:00,951 --> 00:20:03,787
A LITTLE TOO HARSH
WITH YOU.

438
00:20:05,122 --> 00:20:07,124
BUT YOU'RE THE FIRST ONE

439
00:20:07,207 --> 00:20:09,626
WHO'S TREATED ME
LIKE A PERSON.

440
00:20:09,710 --> 00:20:12,212
AND NOT SOME CHINA DOLL.

441
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:18,844
IS THERE ANYONE ELSE
YOU CAN TALK TO?

442
00:20:18,927 --> 00:20:20,804
MANNY KNOWS.

443
00:20:20,888 --> 00:20:22,222
AND PETER.

444
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:30,772
WELL,
I'M HERE FOR YOU TOO,

445
00:20:32,941 --> 00:20:34,943
WHATEVER YOU NEED.

446
00:20:45,621 --> 00:20:48,665
TOBY:
GUYS, COME ON.
GIVE IT BACK.

447
00:20:48,749 --> 00:20:50,083
COME ON, TOBY,
COME ON.

448
00:20:50,167 --> 00:20:52,002
TOBY:
COME ON, GIVE IT BACK!

449
00:20:59,343 --> 00:21:01,345
YOU HEARD HIM.
GIVE IT BACK.

450
00:21:02,471 --> 00:21:04,806
AND WHAT'RE YOU GONNA DO?
SING KUMBAYA?

451
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:08,268
NOT THIS TIME.

452
00:21:09,019 --> 00:21:30,082
♪♪♪

453
00:21:30,165 --> 00:21:31,667
WALK AWAY, COWARD!

454
00:21:32,501 --> 00:21:33,669
WALK AWAY!
