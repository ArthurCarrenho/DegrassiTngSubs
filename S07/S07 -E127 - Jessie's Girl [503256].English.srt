TRY TO MAKE PEOPLE THINK.

I THINK WHAT YOU'RE
GETTING AT IS THAT,

00:17:22,417 --> 00:17:25,337
RATHER THAN SOBERLY
ACCEPT THE FACT

383

SO, I'M HERE TO ASK

412
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:51,882
WHY YOU HUMILIATED ME
IN PUBLIC?

413
00:18:51,965 --> 00:18:55,344
WHAT RIGHT DO YOU HAVE
TO COMMENT ON MY PRIVATE LIFE?

UM, JESSE IS MY BOYFRIEND.

416

AH...
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME?

417
00:19:10,526 --> 00:19:12,986
I'M SLEEPING WITH THE BOSS.

418
00:19:13,070 --> 00:19:16,532
I THOUGHT THAT MIGHT LOOK...
UNPROFESSIONAL.

419
00:19:16,615 --> 00:19:18,575
ELLIE,
IF I'D HAD ANY IDEA...

420
00:19:18,659 --> 00:19:21,036
UM, JESSE DIDN'T SAY
ANYTHING.

421
00:19:21,119 --> 00:19:22,412
I KNOW. I KNOW.

422
00:19:23,455 --> 00:19:26,124
AND THAT'S WHY I QUIT
THE PAPER.

423
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:29,044
YOU WHAT?
WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT?

424
00:19:29,127 --> 00:19:32,840
I WANTED ME AND JESSE
TO WORK SO BADLY.

425
00:19:34,466 --> 00:19:36,718
YOU COULD BE
A GREAT JOURNALIST.

426

DON'T LET A FRESHMAN ROMANCE

427

STAND IN THE WAY
OF YOUR CAREER.

428

THE HARD WAY.
