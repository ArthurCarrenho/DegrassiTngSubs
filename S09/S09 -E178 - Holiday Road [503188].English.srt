TALKING ABOUT?

345
00:15:42,317 --> 00:15:43,944
IF YOU HAVE A PROBLEM,
TALK TO ME IN PERSON,

346
00:15:44,027 --> 00:15:45,529
NOT IN FRONT
OF THE WHOLE CLASS.

347
00:15:45,612 --> 00:15:47,948
YOU BLOGGED THAT I WAS CHEAP
TO THE WHOLE WORLD!

348
00:15:48,031 --> 00:15:50,617
DANNY, I POSED
AN ETHICAL QUESTION,

349
00:15:50,701 --> 00:15:51,869
SO READERS WOULD COMMENT.

350
00:15:51,952 --> 00:15:54,830
GOSSIP NEEDS CONTROVERSY,
DUMMY!

351
00:15:54,913 --> 00:15:56,123
SO YOU DON'T THINK
I'M CHEAP?

352
00:15:56,206 --> 00:15:59,001
NO. BUT YOU MIGHT BE
A JERK.

353
00:16:17,144 --> 00:16:19,563
SO, YOU'RE GONNA HIDE OUT
HERE ALL DAY?

354
00:16:19,646 --> 00:16:22,399
NO, I'M GONNA HIDE OUT
HERE FOREVER.

355
00:16:22,482 --> 00:16:23,400
WELL, WOULD YOU AT LEAST

356
00:16:23,483 --> 00:16:25,569
LIKE SOMETHING
TO GO WITH THAT SELF-PITY?

357
00:16:25,652 --> 00:16:26,778
MORE COFFEE, TEA?

358
00:16:26,862 --> 00:16:29,448
SORRY, WE DON'T SERVE
THE STRONG STUFF.

359
00:16:29,531 --> 00:16:30,991
GET ME...

360
00:16:31,074 --> 00:16:34,203
A DOUBLE-DOT BURGER.
WITH BACON.

361
00:16:35,329 --> 00:16:36,914
WHAT, SERIOUSLY?!

362
00:16:36,997 --> 00:16:38,373
THERE'S NO POINT
TO BEING VEG.

363
00:16:38,457 --> 00:16:39,917
OR TO ANYTHING ELSE
THAT I DO.

364
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,793
I MIGHT AS WELL SEE
WHAT I'VE BEEN MISSING.

365
00:16:41,877 --> 00:16:43,003
REBOUND EATING?

366
00:16:43,086 --> 00:16:45,255
THAT'S NO WAY TO END UP
IN THE WONDERFUL WORLD OF MEAT.

367
00:16:45,339 --> 00:16:46,673
NO, NO, NO.
NO DEAL.

368
00:16:47,716 --> 00:16:50,177
CAN I ASK YOU SOMETHING?

369
00:16:51,553 --> 00:16:52,554
YES.

370
00:16:54,139 --> 00:16:56,600
WHEN YOUR FRIENDS
WENT AWAY TO UNIVERSITY,

371
00:16:56,683 --> 00:16:59,603
DID YOU FEEL LIKE YOU DIDN'T
LIVE UP TO EXPECTATIONS?

372
00:16:59,686 --> 00:17:01,730
WHOSE EXPECTATIONS?

373
00:17:03,232 --> 00:17:05,484
YEAH, MAYBE A LITTLE.

374
00:17:06,527 --> 00:17:08,904
BUT NOW,
I HAVE MY JOB,

375
00:17:08,987 --> 00:17:10,489
MY LOFT, MY BAND.

376
00:17:10,572 --> 00:17:11,490
JANE.

377
00:17:12,533 --> 00:17:15,661
SO, STAYING HERE
WAS JUST... ME.

378
00:17:17,579 --> 00:17:19,498
AND YOU'RE HAPPY?

379
00:17:20,541 --> 00:17:21,416
YEAH.

380
00:17:22,751 --> 00:17:24,336
I'M JEALOUS.

381
00:17:24,419 --> 00:17:25,420
HOLLY J:
SORRY I'M LATE!

382
00:17:25,504 --> 00:17:26,380
SPINNER:
AGAIN.

383
00:17:26,463 --> 00:17:28,715
HEY, I'VE GOT TWO JOBS,
TAE-KWON-DO,

384
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:31,009
AND MEETINGS,
MEETINGS, MEETINGS!

385
00:17:31,093 --> 00:17:32,386
DROWNING YOUR SORROWS?

386
00:17:32,469 --> 00:17:34,555
JUST PUTTING THEM OFF.

387
00:17:34,638 --> 00:17:36,014
I'M SORRY ABOUT
THE OUTBURST.

388
00:17:36,098 --> 00:17:37,307
MEH. IT WASN'T
THE WORST THING

389
00:17:37,391 --> 00:17:38,976
YOU'VE DONE IN FRONT
OF THE ENTIRE SCHOOL.

390
00:17:39,059 --> 00:17:40,561
'LEAST YOU KEPT
YOUR CLOTHES ON!

391
00:17:40,644 --> 00:17:42,020
HEY!

392
00:17:42,104 --> 00:17:44,314
(LAUGHS)
WHAT WAS WRONG
WITH ME BACK THEN?

393
00:17:44,398 --> 00:17:45,732
HOLLY J:
I KINDA THOUGHT IT WAS AMAZING
HOW YOU'D DO ANYTHING

394
00:17:45,816 --> 00:17:49,820
FOR YOUR BELIEFS,
EVEN IF THEY WERE INSANE.

395
00:17:49,903 --> 00:17:52,906
I WAS PRETTY BAD-ASS,
WASN'T I?

396
00:17:57,828 --> 00:17:59,204
SPIKE:
YOU'RE DROPPING OUT?!

397
00:17:59,288 --> 00:18:01,290
MR. SIMPSON:
LOOK, LOOK. YOU'RE IN A FRAGILE
EMOTIONAL STATE RIGHT NOW,

398
00:18:01,373 --> 00:18:02,916
MAKING RASH DECISIONS.

399
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,586
MANNY WENT TO HOLLYWOOD,
LIBERTY JOINED A SORORITY,

400
00:18:05,669 --> 00:18:08,547
MY MARKS SUCK!
WHY WOULD I GO BACK?

401
00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:10,674
TO GET A WELL ROUNDED
EDUCATION? HMM?

402
00:18:10,757 --> 00:18:11,758
TO GET A JOB?

403
00:18:11,842 --> 00:18:13,093
EMMA, THIS IS YOUR FUTURE
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT!

404
00:18:13,177 --> 00:18:15,012
UNIVERSITY'S NOT FOR EVERYONE!

405
00:18:15,095 --> 00:18:17,347
I MEAN, YOU DROPPED OUT MOM,
AND YOU DID OKAY.

406
00:18:17,431 --> 00:18:19,600
YEAH, FOR SOMEONE
WHO GOT PREGNANT AT 14!

407
00:18:19,683 --> 00:18:20,684
BUT YOU KNOW, EM,

408
00:18:20,767 --> 00:18:22,519
I DIDN'T ALWAYS DREAM
OF BECOMING A HAIRDRESSER!

409
00:18:22,603 --> 00:18:25,939
WELL, SORRY,
I CRAMPED YOUR STYLE.

410
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:34,698
I ALWAYS WANTED YOU
TO HAVE MORE.

411
00:18:34,781 --> 00:18:37,701
MORE CHOICES.
MORE OPPORTUNITIES.

412
00:18:37,784 --> 00:18:41,288
BUT NOBODY WANTS YOU
TO BE UNHAPPY.

413
00:18:41,371 --> 00:18:43,749
EMMA,
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO?

414
00:18:44,958 --> 00:18:47,044
I WANT TO HELP PEOPLE.

415
00:18:47,127 --> 00:18:48,837
SOUNDS NAIVE, I KNOW.

416
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:53,342
SOUNDS LIKE THE EM
WE USED TO KNOW.

417
00:18:55,135 --> 00:18:58,055
I'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT
MAYBE TAKING A GAP YEAR.

418
00:18:58,138 --> 00:19:00,265
JUST TO FIGURE OUT
IF SMITHDALE'S RIGHT FOR ME.

419
00:19:00,349 --> 00:19:03,936
AND, I WANNA GO TO UNIVERSITY
SOMEWHERE, SOMEDAY, I JUST...

420
00:19:04,019 --> 00:19:07,564
AT SMITHDALE, I WAS ONLY HAPPY
WHEN I WAS WITH KELLY.

421
00:19:07,648 --> 00:19:09,942
AND, I DON'T KNOW
IF I CAN DO

422
00:19:10,025 --> 00:19:13,028
THE RE-CYCLING TOUR
WITHOUT HIM.

423
00:19:13,111 --> 00:19:15,489
EM, IF YOU REALLY WANT
TO HELP PEOPLE,

424
00:19:15,572 --> 00:19:19,201
DO YOU HAVE TO BE
WITH A GUY TO DO IT?

425
00:19:28,418 --> 00:19:30,003
DANNY:
CHANTAY!

426
00:19:30,087 --> 00:19:31,213
CHANTAY, WAIT!

427
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:37,761
THIS IS FOR FRITZ HELDER

428
00:19:37,845 --> 00:19:40,097
AND THE PHANTOM'S
SOLD OUT SHOW!

429
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:41,723
IN TWO MONTHS.

430
00:19:41,807 --> 00:19:44,810
AND, UH, I HOPE
WE'RE STILL TOGETHER FOR IT.

431
00:19:44,893 --> 00:19:46,270
OKAY.

432
00:19:46,353 --> 00:19:49,147
SO WHAT DO I OWE YOU?

433
00:19:49,231 --> 00:19:51,233
FORTY BUCKS,
PLUS SERVICE CHARGES.

434
00:19:51,316 --> 00:19:54,778
UH, MINUS THE COST
OF ONE LATTE.

435
00:19:54,862 --> 00:19:56,864
I UH, I GUESS
YOU WERE RIGHT.

436
00:19:56,947 --> 00:19:58,782
I'M NOT MUCH FOR BEING
A PUBLIC FIGURE.

437
00:19:58,866 --> 00:20:00,784
THE BLOG'S A REFLECTION
OF MY LIFE, DANNY.

438
00:20:00,868 --> 00:20:02,870
AND YOU'RE A PART OF THAT.

439
00:20:02,953 --> 00:20:06,415
BUT NEXT TIME I MENTION US,
I'LL RUN IT BY YOU FIRST.

440
00:20:06,498 --> 00:20:07,875
SOUNDS GOOD.

441
00:20:07,958 --> 00:20:09,626
WALK YOU TO CLASS?

442
00:20:09,710 --> 00:20:11,795
RIGHT AFTER THIS.

443
00:20:11,879 --> 00:20:12,880
(SMOOCH)

444
00:20:17,634 --> 00:20:19,011
PICK UP THE PACE!

445
00:20:26,852 --> 00:20:27,811
EMMA:
UH...

446
00:20:29,855 --> 00:20:31,148
WHERE DID ALL THESE
BIKES COME FROM?

447
00:20:31,231 --> 00:20:33,650
I THOUGHT YOU
ONLY HAD 12 DONATIONS?

448
00:20:33,734 --> 00:20:35,360
I MADE SOME CALLS.

449
00:20:35,444 --> 00:20:36,862
WHAT CAN I SAY,
I WAS INSPIRED.

450
00:20:36,945 --> 00:20:38,822
AND, A SISTA' WAS IN NEED.

451
00:20:38,906 --> 00:20:40,949
THANK YOU, HOLLY J.

452
00:20:43,076 --> 00:20:45,037
HEY!
THE GANG'S HERE.

453
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:47,831
LISTEN,
KEEP IN TOUCH, OKAY?

454
00:20:47,915 --> 00:20:49,833
YEAH, THAT'S WHAT
THE INTERNET'S FOR.

455
00:20:49,917 --> 00:20:51,251
YOU NEVER KNOW, I MIGHT BE
AROUND TO BOTHER YOU

456
00:20:51,335 --> 00:20:52,628
DURING YOUR SENIOR YEAR.

457
00:20:52,711 --> 00:20:54,922
WELL, WE CAN ALWAYS USE
AN INTERESTING GUEST-SPEAKER.

458
00:20:55,005 --> 00:20:59,134
MR. SIMPSON:
EMMA! YOUR FRIENDS ARE WAITING!

459
00:21:01,428 --> 00:21:03,430
BE CAREFUL. PLEASE.

460
00:21:05,098 --> 00:21:08,685
CALL IF YOU NEED ANYTHING,
ALL RIGHT?

461
00:21:10,229 --> 00:21:12,105
I'LL BE FINE ON MY OWN.

462
00:21:14,024 --> 00:21:15,400
I LOVE YOU.
