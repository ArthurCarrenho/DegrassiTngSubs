00:07:21,233 --> 00:07:23,485
I'VE BEEN WAITING

180
00:07:23,569 --> 00:07:26,321
WELL, YOUR IMPROVEMENT
IS NOTED.

181
00:07:26,405 --> 00:07:27,447
THANKS.

182
00:07:28,949 --> 00:07:31,535
IT'S WEIRD. I'M-
I'M PLAYING A ROLE,

183
00:07:31,618 --> 00:07:33,620
BUT I FEEL LIKE
I CAN BE MYSELF.

184
00:07:33,704 --> 00:07:35,372
YEAH. IT SHOWS.

185
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:37,624
THERE'S A,
A CONFIDENCE ABOUT YOU

186
00:07:37,708 --> 00:07:38,876
THAT I DON'T SEE
AT SCHOOL.

187
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:41,128
WELL, I'M MORE IMPORTANT HERE
THAN IN REAL LIFE.

188
00:07:41,211 --> 00:07:42,671
OH, NO.
NO, THAT'S NOT TRUE.

189
00:07:42,754 --> 00:07:43,672
ANYA:
NO, IT IS.

190
00:07:43,755 --> 00:07:45,382
QUEEN ADAMANTIA,

(EXHALES SHARPLY)

193
00:07:47,634 --> 00:07:50,345
THE KNIGHTS OF TAHA,
WITH THEIR GROWING RANKS,

194
00:07:50,429 --> 00:07:52,389
WILL ATTACK US AND
THE DREADAMORT REALM

00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:54,892
AT NEXT WEEKEND'S
BATTLE.

196
00:07:54,975 --> 00:07:56,143
IF THEY CONQUER
BOROGARD?

197
00:07:56,226 --> 00:07:57,352
THEY'LL STRIP YOU
OF YOUR TITLE.

198
00:07:57,436 --> 00:07:58,437
AND YOURS.

199
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:00,230
WE MUST THINK OF SOMETHING,
BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE.

200
00:08:00,314 --> 00:08:02,399
UH, IT WON'T ESCAPE ME,
MY QUEEN.

201
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:03,817
GOOD.

202
00:08:03,901 --> 00:08:05,360

211
00:08:26,089 --> 00:08:28,383
DUDE, SHE IS NOT
NOT INTO ME, ALL RIGHT.

212
00:08:28,467 --> 00:08:31,178
SHE SMILES A LOT...
SHE'S FRIENDS WITH CLARE,

213
00:08:31,261 --> 00:08:33,263
WE COULD DOUBLE DATE.

214
00:08:33,347 --> 00:08:34,556
WANT ME TO PUT IN
A GOOD WORD?

215
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:37,309
YEAH, YEAH.
THAT'D BE GREAT.

216
00:08:37,392 --> 00:08:38,268
DAVE:

217
00:08:38,352 --> 00:08:39,603
WAIT. WAIT. WAIT. WAIT.
UH-UH.

218
00:08:39,686 --> 00:08:40,437
THAT'S CHICKEN STYLES.

219
00:08:40,521 --> 00:08:42,773
I'VE GOTTA ASK HER OUT

220
00:08:42,856 --> 00:08:45,526

SWIMMING.

223
00:08:55,577 --> 00:08:57,913
YOU HAVE TROPHIES
FOR EVERYTHING.

224
00:08:57,996 --> 00:09:00,707
I DON'T REALLY
LIKE LOSING.

225
00:09:01,792 --> 00:09:03,669
(MUSIC STARTS PLAYING)

226
00:09:03,752 --> 00:09:06,129
WHAT ARE ALL THESE FOR?

227
00:09:07,214 --> 00:09:09,550
THOSE ARE FOR KISSING.

228
00:09:11,134 --> 00:09:12,135
(NERVOUS) OH.

229
00:09:12,219 --> 00:09:15,264

RILEY!
THIS ISN'T LIKE YOU!

238
00:09:37,411 --> 00:09:39,997
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
SURE IT IS.

239
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:40,998
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

240
00:09:41,081 --> 00:09:42,708
I DON'T KNOW,
I JUST WANT YOU SO BAD.

241
00:09:42,791 --> 00:09:44,126
OKAY, YOU'VE BARELY
TOUCHED ME SINCE WE MET

242
00:09:44,209 --> 00:09:45,878
AND NOW YOU'RE ACTING
LIKE THIS HORNY GORILLA?

243
00:09:45,961 --> 00:09:46,879
YOU'RE MY GIRLFRIEND.

244
00:09:46,962 --> 00:09:48,505
WE'RE SUPPOSED
TO MAKE OUT, OKAY?

245
00:09:48,589 --> 00:09:50,465
NOT OKAY.

246
00:09:50,549 --> 00:09:53,927
I THOUGHT WE BOTH DIDN'T
WANT THE PHYSICAL STUFF.

247
00:09:54,011 --> 00:09:55,554
WHY WOULD YOU
THINK THAT?

248
00:09:55,637 --> 00:09:57,681
WELL, YOU'VE NEVER SHOWN
MUCH INTEREST UNTIL NOW.

249
00:09:57,764 --> 00:10:00,142
FIONA, IF YOU'RE LISTENING
TO THOSE RUMOURS-

250
00:10:00,225 --> 00:10:01,685
IT'S NOT JUST THAT.
IT'S-

251
00:10:01,768 --> 00:10:03,604
HOW YOU PARADE ME
AROUND AT SCHOOL.

252
00:10:03,687 --> 00:10:05,272
IT'S LIKE YOU HAVE
SOMETHING TO PROVE.

253
00:10:05,355 --> 00:10:06,857
I THOUGHT
YOU LIKED ME!

254
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:09,067
I DO. WE CAN KEEP DATING

255
00:10:09,151 --> 00:10:11,778
WHILE YOU FIGURE
THIS STUFF OUT.

256
00:10:13,447 --> 00:10:15,699
BUT IF I THOUGHT
YOU WERE STRAIGHT,

257
00:10:15,782 --> 00:10:17,951
WE WOULDN'T BE DOING THIS.

258
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:22,539
GET OUT.

259
00:10:22,623 --> 00:10:23,498
RILEY,
DON'T BE LIKE THIS.

260
00:10:23,582 --> 00:10:24,708

267
00:10:51,985 --> 00:10:53,403
DON'T BE CRASS.

268
00:10:53,487 --> 00:10:55,739
SO, DID YOU "MAKE LOVE,"
LAST NIGHT?

269
00:10:55,822 --> 00:10:56,990
SHUT UP.

270
00:10:57,074 --> 00:10:58,742

272
00:11:00,035 --> 00:11:02,162
RILEY:
WAITING FOR HER TO STOP BEING

00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:04,748
OOH.

00:12:05,976 --> 00:12:07,269
OKAY, THANK YOU.

304
00:12:09,521 --> 00:12:11,106
HI, JENNA.

305
00:12:11,190 --> 00:12:13,317
I WAS WONDERING IF
I COULD ASK YOU SOMETHING.

306
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,735
YEAH, SURE.

307
00:12:16,236 --> 00:12:18,864
UH... THERE COMES A TIME
IN-

308
00:12:19,656 --> 00:12:22,284
IN A MAN'S LIFE WHEN HE...

309
00:12:23,994 --> 00:12:25,162
NEVERMIND.

310
00:12:25,245 --> 00:12:27,331
DID YOU CATCH
WHAT DAWES SAID?

311
00:12:27,414 --> 00:12:29,416
UM... A STILL LIFE
OF THE REAL YOU?

312
00:12:29,499 --> 00:12:30,417
WHATEVER THAT MEANS.

313
00:12:30,501 --> 00:12:31,960
YEAH. I WAS THINKING
OF PAINTING A BASKETBALL.

314
00:12:32,044 --> 00:12:32,878
OR MAYBE A BENCH.

315
00:12:32,961 --> 00:12:35,839
AS IF!
YOU WON THE GAME!

316
00:12:35,923 --> 00:12:38,175
HEY, WAIT!

320
00:12:45,349 --> 00:12:47,643
WANT TO GO WITH...

00:13:04,409 --> 00:13:05,452
WHOO!

325
00:13:15,212 --> 00:13:17,130
TOTALLY MISSED YOU
LAST NIGHT.

326
00:13:17,214 --> 00:13:19,716
I WAS DROWNING IN
"JANIE 'N THE STUZS"

327
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,093
UNPLUGGED.

328
00:13:21,176 --> 00:13:23,053
THAT BAD, HUH?

329
00:13:23,136 --> 00:13:25,264
SORRY I SKIPPED OUT.

330
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:29,101
DID SAV EVEN NOTICE
I WASN'T THERE?

331
00:13:29,184 --> 00:13:30,727
HE, HE WAS IN A MOOD.

332
00:13:30,811 --> 00:13:34,189
NEXT TIME, CAN I PLEASE
GO TO SELF-DEFENSE?

333
00:13:34,273 --> 00:13:36,233
ONLY THING YOU GUYS'LL NEED
SELF-DEFENSE FOR?

334
00:13:36,316 --> 00:13:38,402
IS TO FIGHT OFF
OUR BAND'S GROUPIES!

335
00:13:38,485 --> 00:13:40,529
NOW WHO'S LIVING
IN A FANTASY WORLD?

336
00:13:40,612 --> 00:13:41,655
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,

337
00:13:41,738 --> 00:13:45,200
WHAT'S GOING ON
WITH YOU THESE DAYS?

338
00:13:50,831 --> 00:13:52,416
IT'S LIKE WE'RE THEIR
GIRLFRIENDS,

339
00:13:52,499 --> 00:13:55,544
BUT THEY'RE MARRIED
TO THE BAND.

340
00:14:01,925 --> 00:14:03,844
LEIA, YOU ARE A GENIUS.

341
00:14:04,845 --> 00:14:06,763
WHY?
WHAT'S THAT?

342
00:14:08,182 --> 00:14:09,391
OKAY, JUST TELL ME

I NEED SOME
MORE ADVICE.

348
00:14:20,986 --> 00:14:22,362
HOW DO I BREAK UP

349
00:14:22,446 --> 00:14:23,405
UHHHH...

350
00:14:23,488 --> 00:14:24,740
