I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU WENT TO THE TROUBLE

201
00:07:26,113 --> 00:07:27,531
TO FIND ALL THAT OUT.

202
00:07:27,614 --> 00:07:29,825
WELL, I DO HAVE GOVERNMENT
INTELLIGENCE CONTACTS.

203
00:07:30,868 --> 00:07:32,786
BUT... (WHISPERING)
IT WAS MOSTLY FIONA

204
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:35,539
BRIBING ALL YOUR FRIENDS
FOR ME.

205
00:07:35,622 --> 00:07:38,041

(CHUCKLES)

218
00:07:55,142 --> 00:07:56,602
BUT WHEN WE LIVED
IN THAILAND,

219
00:07:56,685 --> 00:07:58,520
I DID MEET THE DALAI LAMA.

220
00:07:58,604 --> 00:07:59,938

231
00:08:20,626 --> 00:08:22,586
IT'S A TEARJERKER.

232
00:08:22,669 --> 00:08:24,880
AND HERE I THOUGHT
THIS WAS A CONVERSATION,

233
00:08:24,963 --> 00:08:25,672
NOT A SCRIPT!

256
00:09:24,273 --> 00:09:27,317
SHE DOESN'T TRUST ME
AT ALL.

00:09:27,401 --> 00:09:29,069
WELL, MAYBE...
TALK TO HER.

258
00:09:29,152 --> 00:09:30,529
JUST TELL HER
HOW YOU FEEL;

259
00:09:30,612 --> 00:09:33,323

262
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:47,212
HONESTLY, IT WASN'T
WHAT IT SOUNDED LIKE.

263
00:09:47,296 --> 00:09:48,922
YES, I STILL HAD PLANS
WITH TRISH, BUT...

264
00:09:49,006 --> 00:09:51,216
