MY TWO THINGS.

521
00:21:07,518 --> 00:21:08,977
ONE, I TOLD YOU THE RULES.

522
00:21:09,061 --> 00:21:11,855
SO IF ANYONE ACTED DUMB,
IT WAS YOU.

523
00:21:11,939 --> 00:21:14,066
AND TWO,
IF WE'RE REALLY BROKEN UP,

524
00:21:14,149 --> 00:21:16,735
I'M GONNA NEED SOMETHING
TO REMEMBER YOU BY.

525
00:21:16,818 --> 00:21:19,029
JOHNNY, THEY'RE PHOTOS OF ME
WITHOUT MY CLOTHES ON.

526
00:21:19,112 --> 00:21:21,406
AND I PROMISE I'LL KEEP 'EM
TO MYSELF.

527
00:21:21,490 --> 00:21:24,076
UNLIKE YOU,
I CAN KEEP A PROMISE.
