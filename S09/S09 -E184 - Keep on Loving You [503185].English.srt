HOLLY J:
I CAN'T TAKE THIS!

00:00:05,464 --> 00:00:06,882
DECLAN:
I WANT YOU TO HAVE IT.

3
00:00:06,965 --> 00:00:09,051
(EXHALES HAPPILY)

4
00:00:09,134 --> 00:00:10,219
I LOVE IT.

5
00:00:11,261 --> 00:00:12,221
THANK YOU.

6
00:00:17,809 --> 00:00:19,937
YOU'RE SURE ABOUT THIS?

7
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:23,273
WE'VE BEEN TOGETHER
AN AMAZING THREE MONTHS,

8
00:00:23,357 --> 00:00:25,692
YOU'RE REALLY GREAT
ABOUT NOT PRESSURING...

9
00:00:25,776 --> 00:00:27,945
AND THE PILL'S BEEN GREAT
FOR MY SKIN!

10
00:00:28,028 --> 00:00:32,032
(HALF LAUGHS)
YOU ARE LOOKING
PARTICULARLY RADIANT.

11
00:00:36,578 --> 00:00:38,372
OKAY, LAST TIME.

12
00:00:39,373 --> 00:00:40,207
YOU'RE SURE?

13
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:41,875
YEAH!

14
00:00:41,959 --> 00:00:44,461
WHY?
AREN'T YOU SURE?

15
00:00:44,545 --> 00:00:46,922
I JUST DON'T WANT THINGS
TO GET WEIRD.

16
00:00:47,005 --> 00:00:48,549
DECLAN,

17
00:00:48,632 --> 00:00:50,759
YOU'RE THE RIGHT PERSON,

18
00:00:50,843 --> 00:00:53,804
AND THIS IS THE RIGHT TIME.

19
00:00:53,887 --> 00:00:54,847

20
00:00:55,681 --> 00:00:57,057

WELL DONE, FASHIONISTA!

41
00:02:09,796 --> 00:02:11,882
I SAW YOUR TWEET ABOUT
THE SIZZLE TEEN INTERNSHIP?

42
00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:14,218
OH RIGHT.
IT WENT THROUGH.

43
00:02:14,301 --> 00:02:16,470
SO, DID YOU AND DECLAN
CELEBRATE LAST NIGHT

44
00:02:16,553 --> 00:02:17,721
AS PLANNED?

45
00:02:17,804 --> 00:02:18,889
(DEADPAN)
YEAH.

46
00:02:18,972 --> 00:02:21,642
JANE:
BOO-YA!
WELCOME TO THE CLUB!

47
00:02:21,725 --> 00:02:23,519
(LAUGHS)

48
00:02:23,602 --> 00:02:25,270
I'M SORRY,
I'M KIDDING!

49
00:02:25,354 --> 00:02:26,813
IS EVERYTHING OKAY?

50
00:02:27,856 --> 00:02:30,275
I TOLD HIM I LOVE HIM.

51
00:02:30,359 --> 00:02:33,153
WOW, OKAY!
WHAT DID HE SAY?

52
00:02:33,237 --> 00:02:35,155
HE DIDN'T SAY IT.

53
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:39,535
MAYBE HE JUST DIDN'T
GET THE CHANCE.

54
00:02:39,618 --> 00:02:41,203
DECLAN:
WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?

55
00:02:41,286 --> 00:02:42,746
BESIDES ANYA'S LACK
OF FASHION SENSE?

56
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:44,623
ANYA:
I JUST DON'T SEE WHY AN ALIEN
NEEDS A KEFFIYEH.

57
00:02:44,706 --> 00:02:46,124
FI, ANYA'S YOUR BOSS.

58
00:02:46,208 --> 00:02:47,668
WORK IT OUT.

59
00:02:50,754 --> 00:02:52,673
MUSICAL STRIFE?

60
00:02:52,756 --> 00:02:56,677
NOTHING ANOTHER NIGHT OF FUN
CAN'T SOLVE.

61
00:02:57,177 --> 00:02:59,096
OH NO, IT GOT WEIRD.

62
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:00,222
DECLAN,

63
00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:03,559
THE WAY WE FEEL
ABOUT EACH OTHER,

64
00:03:03,642 --> 00:03:05,644
WE'RE ON THE SAME PAGE,
RIGHT?

65
00:03:05,727 --> 00:03:06,937
OF COURSE!

66
00:03:08,146 --> 00:03:09,064
WHERE ARE WE EATING LUNCH?

67
00:03:09,147 --> 00:03:10,107
WAIT.

68
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:12,985
LAST NIGHT,
WHEN I TOLD YOU I LOVE YOU-

69
00:03:13,068 --> 00:03:15,737
CAN WE NOT TALK ABOUT THIS?

70
00:03:15,821 --> 00:03:18,198
DECLAN, DO YOU LOVE ME?

71
00:03:22,369 --> 00:03:24,496
IT'S NOT THAT SIMPLE.

72
00:03:25,831 --> 00:03:26,999
OH MY GOD.

73
00:03:37,301 --> 00:03:38,093
PETER:
WE SHOULDN'T DO THIS.

74
00:03:38,177 --> 00:03:39,970
I WON'T TELL,
I PROMISE.

75
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:41,805
THIS HAS TO BE
OUR LAST KISS.

76
00:03:41,889 --> 00:03:44,308
I KNOW.
YOUR HEART BELONGS TO DIDI.

77
00:03:44,391 --> 00:03:47,227
BUT JUST FOR THIS MOMENT...
MAKE ME FORGET.

78
00:03:47,311 --> 00:03:48,854
MAKE ME FORGET.

79
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,399
DANNY:
WHOA! HEY!

80
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:55,986
UH, INTENSE SCENE.
LOOKS GREAT!

81
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:58,697
OKAY, EVERYONE,
TAKE FIVE.

82
00:04:03,035 --> 00:04:04,995
I GOT YOUR TICKETS.

83
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:05,954
ALL 14 OF THEM.

84
00:04:06,038 --> 00:04:07,831
AW, DANNY!
(TITTERS)

85
00:04:08,874 --> 00:04:09,917
MOM GOT A LITTLE
CARRIED AWAY

86
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,252
WHEN SHE HEARD
I GOT THE LEAD.

87
00:04:12,336 --> 00:04:14,630
SO YOUR WHOLE FAMILY'LL
BE THERE...

88
00:04:14,713 --> 00:04:17,007
TO WATCH YOU KISS
ANOTHER GUY!

89
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:18,175
(SCOFFS)
DON'T BE JEALOUS.

90
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:19,635
AH... I'M NOT.

91
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:23,055

94
00:04:36,944 --> 00:04:38,612
HELLO?
PERSONAL SPACE?!

95
00:04:38,695 --> 00:04:40,405
I'LL LEAVE YOU
TO YOUR PRECIOUS SOLITUDE.

96
00:04:40,489 --> 00:04:42,824
I JUST NEED YOU TO GIVE THIS
BACK TO YOUR BROTHER.

97
00:04:44,743 --> 00:04:47,704
WHY DO YOU HAVE
MY GRANDMOTHER'S BRACELET?

98
00:04:47,788 --> 00:04:50,249
DECLAN GAVE IT TO ME.

99
00:04:50,332 --> 00:04:51,583
HE DID?

100
00:04:51,667 --> 00:04:53,126
(SIGHS) WOW.

101
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:56,880
I THOUGHT HE WAS SAVING IT
FOR SOMEONE SPECIAL.

102
00:04:56,964 --> 00:04:58,382
GUESS HE LOVES YOU.

103
00:04:58,465 --> 00:05:00,634
THEN WHY CAN'T HE SAY IT?

104
00:05:00,717 --> 00:05:02,594
LOOK, MY BROTHER'S
ONLY DROPPED THE L-BOMB

105
00:05:02,678 --> 00:05:03,554
ON ONE PERSON.

106
00:05:03,637 --> 00:05:05,138
AND THEN OF COURSE,
LIKE, TWO SECONDS LATER,

107
00:05:05,222 --> 00:05:06,598
SHE CHEATED ON HIM.

108
00:05:06,682 --> 00:05:09,476
SMASHED HIS HEART
INTO A MILLION PIECES.

109
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,645
SO YOU THINK HE'S JUST SCARED
TO SAY IT?

110
00:05:14,022 --> 00:05:16,066
THEN I GUESS
I'LL KEEP THIS.

111
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:17,609
THANKS, FIONA!

112
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:21,822

128
00:05:59,276 --> 00:06:00,444
I HAD SALAD IN MY TEETH-

129

I DON'T WANT YOU
TO KISS HER.

YOU SMELL FINE.

STRONGER WITHOUT THE KISS.

00:07:46,508 --> 00:07:47,509
WHAT?

WHY IS IT A PROBLEM NOW?

172
00:07:52,264 --> 00:07:53,432
IT'S NOT.
FROM THE KISS.
