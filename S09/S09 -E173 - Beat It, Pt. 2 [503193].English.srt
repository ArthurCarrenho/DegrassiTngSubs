I DON'T KNOW,
SOME GUYS HAVE IT,

354
00:15:44,778 --> 00:15:47,030
SOME GUYS JUST DON'T.

355
00:15:53,078 --> 00:15:54,371
MAYBE IT'S KARMA.

356
00:15:54,454 --> 00:15:56,248
SOMEONE NEEDS TO PUT ME
OUT OF MY MISERY.

357
00:15:56,331 --> 00:15:58,208
IS THAT VODKA?

358
00:15:58,292 --> 00:15:59,585

LOOK, UM, I'M SORRY
I MADE FUN OF YOU.

375
00:16:49,676 --> 00:16:52,262
IT'S JUST I TELL YOU
EVERYTHING ABOUT THE BAND.

376
00:16:52,346 --> 00:16:54,598
