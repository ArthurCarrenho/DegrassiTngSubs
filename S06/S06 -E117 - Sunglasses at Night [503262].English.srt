TO GO FROM ALWAYS HAVING
SOMEBODY THERE

41
00:01:23,458 --> 00:01:25,752
TO BEING TOTALLY ALONE?

42
00:01:25,836 --> 00:01:27,671
LOOK,
WHEN DYLAN WAS HERE,

43
00:01:27,754 --> 00:01:29,089

146
00:06:05,532 --> 00:06:06,366
DON'T SAY
WHERE YOU GOT IT.

147
00:06:06,450 --> 00:06:08,327
IT CAN BE OUR SECRET.

PAIGE:
ELLIE, I KNOW YOU HAD YOUR EYE
ON DYLAN'S ROOM,

152
00:06:27,179 --> 00:06:28,055
BUT HE GAVE IT TO ME.

153
00:06:28,138 --> 00:06:30,057
WELL, WE SHOULD HAVE
HAD A VOTE.

154
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:32,392
PAIGE:
NOT A BIG FAN OF DEMOCRACY,
HON.

155
00:06:32,476 --> 00:06:35,062
MARCO, TELL HER YOU DON'T MIND
IF I TAKE DYLAN'S ROOM.

156
00:06:35,145 --> 00:06:37,856
ELLIE:
DON'T LET PRINCESS
ALWAYS-GETS-HER-WAY BULLY YOU,

157
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:38,941
OR MANIPULATE YOU.

158
00:06:39,024 --> 00:06:40,400
SHE HAS A WAY
WITH MEN.

159
00:06:40,484 --> 00:06:42,110
PAIGE:

ONLINE COMMUNITY MODERATION.

169
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:15,394
ANY THOUGHTS?
IS IT GOOD? BAD?

170
00:07:15,477 --> 00:07:16,395
IT'S CENSORSHIP.

171
00:07:16,478 --> 00:07:18,814
IT'S ABOUT KEEPING THE INTERNET
SAFE FOR EVERYBODY.

172
00:07:18,897 --> 00:07:20,566
YEAH, WELL, WHO GETS
TO DECIDE WHAT'S SAFE

173
00:07:20,649 --> 00:07:21,149

174
00:07:21,233 --> 00:07:22,109
YOU?

175
00:07:25,195 --> 00:07:26,488
I'M NOT SURPRISED
YOU'D SAY THAT,

176
00:07:26,572 --> 00:07:27,990
YOU ONLY CARE
ABOUT YOURSELF.

177

NO GIRLFRIENDS,
NO GREASEMONKEY BOSSES.

359
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:04,882
COULD BE A REGULAR GIG, HUNH?

360
00:16:04,965 --> 00:16:05,924
YEAH, RIGHT.

361
00:16:06,008 --> 00:16:07,426
IF ANYBODY FINDS OUT
WE'RE USING THE STORE,

362
00:16:07,509 --> 00:16:08,677
I'M DEAD.

363

THERE'S NO WAY YOU GOT
THE STRAIGHT FLUSH,

367
00:16:29,448 --> 00:16:30,407
BLUFF-MEISTER.

368

JAY:
WELL, THE BEAUTIFUL THING IS,

369
00:16:32,159 --> 00:16:34,661
THERE'S NO SUCH THING

370
00:16:35,787 --> 00:16:37,539
SO, JAKE,

00:16:44,630 --> 00:16:45,380
WE GOT A BREAK
AND ENTER CALL.

375
00:16:45,464 --> 00:16:46,215

376
00:16:46,298 --> 00:16:47,424

00:16:52,554 --> 00:16:53,972
MARCO:
WHAT?! ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!

380
00:16:54,056 --> 00:16:55,432
DON'T YOU GUYS HAVE
SOME KIND OF MURDER

381
00:16:55,516 --> 00:16:56,767
YOU COULD BE SOLVING?

382
00:16:56,850 --> 00:17:00,771
FEMALE OFFICER:
YOU'RE UNDER ARREST
FOR TRESPASSING.

383
00:17:02,147 --> 00:17:03,857
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

384
00:17:03,941 --> 00:17:05,984
MAYBE IF YOU'D ANSWERED

385
00:17:06,068 --> 00:17:08,153
OR RETURNED MY MESSAGES?

386
00:17:08,237 --> 00:17:09,571
KIM TATTLED TO MY MOM.

387
00:17:09,655 --> 00:17:12,157
KIM SHOULD MIND
HER OWN BEESWAX.

388
00:17:12,241 --> 00:17:13,992
THERE'S NOTHING WRONG
WITH US BEING TOGETHER.

389
00:17:14,076 --> 00:17:15,911
WE'RE NOT GOING
TO BE TOGETHER.

390
00:17:15,994 --> 00:17:16,662
MY PARENTS ARE
TALKING ABOUT

391
00:17:16,745 --> 00:17:18,288
SENDING ME
TO BOARDING SCHOOL.

392
00:17:18,372 --> 00:17:19,957
WHAT?!
SHE CAN'T.

393
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:21,208
SHE ALSO SAID,

394
00:17:21,291 --> 00:17:23,001
IF YOU KNOW WHAT'S
GOOD FOR YOU,

395
00:17:23,085 --> 00:17:24,461
YOU'LL KEEP
YOUR DISTANCE.

396
00:17:24,545 --> 00:17:27,172
YOUR MOM CAN'T KEEP US APART,
PETER.

397
00:17:27,256 --> 00:17:29,383
DO YOU BELIEVE THAT
LOVE CONQUERS ALL?

398
00:17:29,466 --> 00:17:31,176
I DON'T THINK
IT'S GOING TO BE ENOUGH.

399
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:34,263
THERE'S ALWAYS SOMETHING
IN OUR WAY.

400
00:17:39,434 --> 00:17:42,271
I'LL BE AT OUR
SECRET PLACE TOMORROW.

401
00:17:42,354 --> 00:17:45,774

MARCO:
SPINNER! SPINNER!
THANK GOD.

405
00:18:00,789 --> 00:18:01,957
TELL HER...
TELL HER THAT I-

406
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:03,709
WHAT IS GOING ON HERE,
MARCO?

407
00:18:03,792 --> 00:18:05,169
DUDE, I PRESSED
THE ALARM CODE.

408
00:18:05,252 --> 00:18:06,461
IT DIDN'T EVEN GO OFF.

409
00:18:06,545 --> 00:18:08,005
IT'S A SILENT ALARM,
IDIOT.

410
00:18:08,088 --> 00:18:10,007
OFFICER:
IS THIS A FRIEND
OF YOURS?

411
00:18:10,090 --> 00:18:11,425
HE'S A PART-TIME
EMPLOYEE.

00:18:11,508 --> 00:18:14,553
OFFICER:
WITH PERMISSION
TO BE HERE?

413
00:18:14,636 --> 00:18:15,387

00:18:17,097 --> 00:18:20,475
OFFICER:
I'M GONNA HAVE
TO TAKE HIM IN.

415
00:18:22,102 --> 00:18:23,270
COME ON.

416
00:18:40,871 --> 00:18:43,540
(DOOR SQUEAKS AS IT OPENS)

417
00:18:54,468 --> 00:18:56,762
IF THEY'RE SENDING ME
AWAY,

418
00:18:56,845 --> 00:18:57,930
I HAVE NOTHING TO LOSE,

419
00:18:58,013 --> 00:18:59,097
EXCEPT YOU.

420
00:18:59,973 --> 00:19:02,226
PETER,
YOU'VE GOT ME.

421
00:19:13,570 --> 00:19:15,739
ELLIE LET ME IN.

422
00:19:15,822 --> 00:19:18,450
UNCLE LOUIE TALKED
TO HIS COP BUDDY AT 54.

423
00:19:18,534 --> 00:19:19,952
YOU HAD TROUBLE
AT THE STORE?

424
00:19:20,035 --> 00:19:20,536
YEAH.

425
00:19:20,619 --> 00:19:22,538
I WAS HOPING YOU WOULDN'T
FIND OUT ABOUT THAT.

426
00:19:23,372 --> 00:19:27,751
YEAH, WELL, UNCLE LOUIE
MENTIONED A POKER GAME.

427
00:19:28,293 --> 00:19:30,629
THE POLICE CONFISCATED
THE MONEY,

428
00:19:30,712 --> 00:19:32,923
SO I HAVE A BUNCH OF MECHANICS
FOR ENEMIES NOW.

429
00:19:33,006 --> 00:19:36,301
BUT SPINNER DROPPED
THE TRESPASSING CHARGES.

430
00:19:36,385 --> 00:19:37,845
IT'S FINE.

431
00:19:37,928 --> 00:19:40,222
I GUESS YOU'RE LUCKY.

432
00:19:42,057 --> 00:19:44,685
SO, DO YOU KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT THE $600 I'M MISSING?

433
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:46,770
UH...

434
00:19:50,816 --> 00:19:53,110
I WAS IN THE HOLE, DAD.

435
00:19:53,193 --> 00:19:54,903
MARCO, HOW COULD YOU?

436
00:19:55,445 --> 00:19:57,364
MARCO:
I NEEDED IT.

437
00:19:57,447 --> 00:19:58,407
COME ON,
YOU KNOW HOW IT IS.

438
00:19:58,490 --> 00:19:59,992
YOU GAMBLE EVERY WEEKEND.

439
00:20:00,075 --> 00:20:02,286
MARCO,
YOU STOLE FROM FAMILY!

440
00:20:02,369 --> 00:20:04,204
ARE-ARE YOU IN TROUBLE
OR SOMETHING, MARCO?

441
00:20:04,288 --> 00:20:05,497
IS THERE SOMETHING
YOU'RE NOT TELLING ME?

442
00:20:05,581 --> 00:20:05,873
NO!

443
00:20:11,253 --> 00:20:12,754
IT'S DYLAN, DAD.

444
00:20:12,838 --> 00:20:15,048
WELL, HOW'S DYLAN
THE PROBLEM, MARCO?

445
00:20:15,132 --> 00:20:17,926
I FEEL EMPTY WITHOUT HIM,
DAD.

446
00:20:18,010 --> 00:20:19,803
I'M LOST.

447
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:23,098
HE'S MY BOYFRIEND.

448
00:20:25,184 --> 00:20:27,019
YOU THINK I'M STUPID?

449
00:20:27,102 --> 00:20:29,396
NO, OF COURSE NOT.

450
00:20:29,479 --> 00:20:31,899
YOU ABUSED YOUR FRIENDS
AND YOUR FAMILY

451
00:20:31,982 --> 00:20:34,693
BECAUSE PLAYING CARDS
WAS MORE IMPORTANT.

452
00:20:34,776 --> 00:20:36,361
NOW, NO MATTER
WHAT DYLAN IS TO YOU,

453
00:20:36,445 --> 00:20:37,529
HE'S NOT A PART OF THIS

454
00:20:37,613 --> 00:20:39,615
AND YOU KNOW THAT.

455
00:20:45,412 --> 00:20:46,622
I'M DONE.

456
00:20:47,331 --> 00:20:49,750
I'M DONE WITH IT,
OKAY?

457
00:20:50,292 --> 00:20:51,460
PROMISE.

458
00:20:54,296 --> 00:20:57,382
I UNDERSTAND
IF YOU HATE ME FOR IT.

459
00:20:57,466 --> 00:20:58,467
MARCO...

460
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:01,803
YOU'RE MY SON.

461
00:21:01,887 --> 00:21:04,306
I'M GOING TO WATCH YOU.

462
00:21:05,307 --> 00:21:06,225
JUST...

463
00:21:07,809 --> 00:21:09,394
GO TO SCHOOL.

464
00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:12,439
AND IF YOU HAVE
ANY HONOUR,

465
00:21:12,523 --> 00:21:15,859
YOU'LL COME AND SEE ME
AT THE SHOP;

466
00:21:15,943 --> 00:21:19,112
YOU CAN WORK OFF
WHAT YOU STOLE.

467
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:23,909
PEOPLE LEAVE, MARCO.

468
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:28,330
YOU HAVE TO LIVE
YOUR OWN LIFE.
