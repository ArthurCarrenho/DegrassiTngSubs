00:08:14,328 --> 00:08:15,954
YOU'D UNDERSTAND.

183
00:08:16,038 --> 00:08:17,331
WELL, I DON'T.

184
00:08:17,414 --> 00:08:20,459
YOU HAVE TO TAKE
THIS DOWN.

185
00:08:20,542 --> 00:08:22,544
I-I DON'T WANT TO.

186
00:08:24,338 --> 00:08:26,423
I CAN'T EVEN DEAL WITH THIS
RIGHT NOW.

187
00:08:26,507 --> 00:08:27,925
I GOTTA GO.

188
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:31,929
(EXHALES)

189
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:40,979
OH.

190
00:08:42,439 --> 00:08:44,107
JESSE:
WOW. THAT'S UH...

191
00:08:44,191 --> 00:08:46,985
A LOT OF BIRTH CONTROL.

192
00:08:47,069 --> 00:08:49,446
IN SO MANY FORMS
AND COLOURS.

193
00:08:51,073 --> 00:08:52,616
YEAH, WELL UM...

194
00:08:52,699 --> 00:08:53,450
I TOLD THE WOMAN

195
00:08:53,534 --> 00:08:55,702
I DON'T ACTUALLY WANT
ANY BIRTH CONTROL,

196
00:08:55,786 --> 00:08:57,663
JUST...JUST THE INFORMATION
PLEASE.

197
00:08:57,746 --> 00:08:59,373
AND SHE LOOKED AT ME
LIKE I HAD FOUR NOSES

198
00:08:59,456 --> 00:09:00,958
AND INSISTED
I TAKE ALL THIS

199
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:01,708
WHEN I WAS LIKE,

200
00:09:01,792 --> 00:09:04,711
PLEASE, I JUST WANT
THE INFORMATION.

201
00:09:04,795 --> 00:09:05,546
THAT IS ALL.

202
00:09:05,629 --> 00:09:07,798
YOU KNOW,
I LIKE TO READ.

203
00:09:07,881 --> 00:09:09,383
I'M A RESEARCHY TYPE.

204
00:09:09,466 --> 00:09:10,634
NINA:

205
00:09:14,304 --> 00:09:15,931
JESSE:
I'LL UH...

206
00:09:16,014 --> 00:09:17,850
CATCH YOU LATER.

207
00:09:56,346 --> 00:09:58,098
SO HOW NAKED
ARE WE GETTING HERE?

208
00:09:58,182 --> 00:10:00,225
NAKED?
I DON'T DO THAT, THANKS.

209
00:10:00,309 --> 00:10:01,351
JOKING.

210
00:10:03,312 --> 00:10:05,731
SO YOU GOT INTO A FIGHT
WITH SPINNER?

211
00:10:05,814 --> 00:10:06,773
UH, WAS IT A FIGHT?

212
00:10:06,857 --> 00:10:08,317
OR THE FIGHT?

213
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:09,902
DID YOU GUYS BREAK UP?

214
00:10:09,985 --> 00:10:11,361
I DON'T KNOW YET.

215
00:10:13,447 --> 00:10:13,780
YET?

216
00:10:14,865 --> 00:10:16,783
THAT'S NOT SOUNDING GOOD.

217
00:10:17,367 --> 00:10:19,578
I COULDN'T BELIEVE IT
WHEN EMMA DUMPED ME.

218
00:10:19,661 --> 00:10:20,871
HURT LIKE HELL.

219
00:10:20,954 --> 00:10:22,581
STILL DOES.

220
00:10:22,664 --> 00:10:24,499
WHICH IS WHY THIS HAS
BEEN SO GREAT.

221
00:10:24,583 --> 00:10:27,252
SOMEONE TO HANG WITH
AND TO TALK TO.

222
00:10:27,336 --> 00:10:29,713
SOMEONE COOL...
LIKE YOU.

223
00:10:32,174 --> 00:10:33,342
LET'S GET ON WITH IT.

224
00:10:33,425 --> 00:10:37,596
I WANT GET THESE PICTURES

WOW!

00:10:49,149 --> 00:10:50,067
THAT ONE'S GORGEOUS.

228
00:10:53,278 --> 00:10:54,363
CAN YOU FLIP
YOUR HAIR A LITTLE?

229
00:10:59,368 --> 00:11:00,869
WOW! DARCY!

230
00:11:03,413 --> 00:11:04,373
THAT'S GOOD.

231
00:11:13,549 --> 00:11:14,258
PETER:
CAN YOU JUST SIT UP?

232
00:11:14,341 --> 00:11:17,302
TILT YOUR HEAD
JUST A LITTLE BIT.

233
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:22,724
WE SAW.

234
00:11:23,475 --> 00:11:25,185
THE RING?
A SHOOTING STAR?

235
00:11:25,269 --> 00:11:28,230
YOUR FUTURE LIVES
AS LONELY OLD DORKS?

236
00:11:28,313 --> 00:11:29,940
DEREK:

00:11:32,192 --> 00:11:33,694
OH, AND WE DON'T MEAN

239
00:11:33,777 --> 00:11:35,320
DANNY:
WE MEAN THE PRIVATE PAGE.

240
00:11:35,404 --> 00:11:36,238
SEX-AY.

241
00:11:36,321 --> 00:11:38,031
WHAT?!

242
00:11:38,115 --> 00:11:39,449
IT'S PASSWORD PROTECTED!

243
00:11:39,533 --> 00:11:40,909
WHAT CAN I SAY?

244
00:11:40,993 --> 00:11:43,036
YEARS OF COMPUTER CAMP
PAID OFF.

245
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:45,831
MY MAN IS LIKE THE OBI-WAN
OF PASSWORD HACKS.

246
00:11:45,914 --> 00:11:47,749
DUDE IS LIKE SCARY.

247
00:11:47,833 --> 00:11:49,293
YOU HACKED IN?
WHY?

248
00:11:49,376 --> 00:11:51,670

00:11:56,383 --> 00:11:57,676
DANNY:

00:11:57,759 --> 00:11:59,928
OH, WE WANT $20.00.

254
00:12:00,012 --> 00:12:01,013
WHOA!

255
00:12:01,096 --> 00:12:04,266
I FORGOT
MY LUNCH MONEY TODAY.

256
00:12:04,349 --> 00:12:08,145
AND WE ALSO WANT A SHOT
OF YOUR BAZOONGAS BY FRIDAY.

257
00:12:08,228 --> 00:12:10,689
BAZOONGAS ARE OFF
THE TABLE.

258
00:12:10,772 --> 00:12:11,899
YOU TWO LITTLE WEIRDOS

259
00:12:11,982 --> 00:12:13,275
FORGET YOU EVER SAW
THAT PAGE

260
00:12:13,358 --> 00:12:14,318
BECAUSE IT IS COMING DOWN

261
00:12:14,401 --> 00:12:17,029
IN OH,
ABOUT 5.7 SECONDS.

262
00:12:24,578 --> 00:12:26,288
BAZOONGAS?

263
00:12:26,371 --> 00:12:28,624
DUDE, YOU'RE SO LAME.

264
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:09,998
LET'S JOIN HANDS.

265
00:13:25,597 --> 00:13:27,391
LORD,
THERE ARE THOSE AMONG US

266
00:13:27,474 --> 00:13:29,268
WHO HAVE BENEFITTED FROM
YOUR LESSONS OF FORGIVENESS

267
00:13:29,351 --> 00:13:30,769
IN THE PAST.

268
00:13:30,853 --> 00:13:31,728
AND IT IS OUR HOPE

269
00:13:31,812 --> 00:13:34,189
THAT THEY WILL EXTEND
FURTHER FORGIVENESS,

270
00:13:34,273 --> 00:13:37,943
UM, TO THOSE WHO REALLY
BADLY NEED IT.

271
00:13:38,235 --> 00:13:38,902
AMEN.

272
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:48,662
DARCY:
SPINNER!

273
00:13:48,745 --> 00:13:50,581
SPINNER, STOP!
PLEASE!

274
00:13:51,498 --> 00:13:53,208
I TOOK THE PAGE DOWN.
IT'S ALL OVER.

275
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:56,378
YOU'RE RIGHT, DARCY.

276
00:13:56,461 --> 00:13:58,172
IT IS ALL OVER.

277
00:13:59,506 --> 00:14:02,009
SPIN,
I KNOW YOU'RE FURIOUS?

278
00:14:02,092 --> 00:14:03,343
BUT YOU HAVE TO KNOW

279
00:14:03,427 --> 00:14:05,387
THAT THESE PICTURES
MEAN NOTHING.

280
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:07,723
THEY MEAN EVERYTHING,
DARCY.

281
00:14:07,806 --> 00:14:09,558
YOU PUT ME THROUGH THE RINGER
ON REVIRGINIZING.

282
00:14:09,641 --> 00:14:11,101
AND THAT WHOLE THING
WITH PAIGE-

283
00:14:11,185 --> 00:14:12,644
THAT WAS CHEATING!

284
00:14:12,728 --> 00:14:13,896
YOU SLEPT WITH HER.

285
00:14:13,979 --> 00:14:14,938
AND THIS IS
SO MUCH BETTER?

286
00:14:15,022 --> 00:14:17,441
YOU'RE POSING FOR RANDOM GUYS
ON THE INTERNET?

287
00:14:17,524 --> 00:14:18,567
IT WASN'T RANDOM.

288
00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:20,235
I MEAN, I KNOW THE GUY.
HE'S A FRIEND.

289
00:14:20,319 --> 00:14:22,988
SO YOU WERE CHEATING.

290
00:14:23,071 --> 00:14:26,700
WHICH MAKES YOU THE BIGGEST
HYPOCRITE THAT EVER LIVED.

291
00:14:26,783 --> 00:14:28,535
JUST TELL ME WHO SENT YOU
THOSE PICTURES?

292
00:14:28,619 --> 00:14:30,621
WAS IT DANNY? DEREK?

293
00:14:30,704 --> 00:14:31,038
WHO?

294
00:14:33,165 --> 00:14:34,208
IT WAS PETER.

295
00:14:42,883 --> 00:14:43,926
EXCUSE ME, SIR?

296
00:14:44,009 --> 00:14:45,761
HI, CAN I HELP YOU?

297
00:14:45,844 --> 00:14:47,513
I'M JUST LOOKING
FOR SOMEBODY.

298
00:14:47,596 --> 00:14:48,680
OH, OKAY.

299
00:14:48,764 --> 00:14:50,933
CAN YOU TELL ME WHO?

300
00:14:53,018 --> 00:14:54,269
SIR, THIS IS A SCHOOL.

301
00:14:54,353 --> 00:14:57,898
WE CAN'T JUST LET STRANGERS
WALK OFF THE STREET.

302
00:14:57,981 --> 00:14:59,316
RIGHT.

303
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:01,026
I UNDERSTAND.

304
00:15:01,109 --> 00:15:02,277
I'LL GO.

305
00:15:14,373 --> 00:15:14,790
WHY?!

306
00:15:15,541 --> 00:15:16,583
JUST TELL ME WHY!

307
00:15:16,667 --> 00:15:19,503
WHY WOULD YOU DO
SOMETHING SO HORRIBLE?

308
00:15:19,586 --> 00:15:21,672
I DIDN'T THINK
IT WAS SO HORRIBLE.

309
00:15:21,755 --> 00:15:22,840
YOU TWO WERE GONNA
BREAK UP ANYWAY.

310
00:15:22,923 --> 00:15:24,341
I NEVER SAID THAT!

311
00:15:24,424 --> 00:15:25,467
YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO.

312
00:15:25,551 --> 00:15:26,301
COME ON, DARCY,

313
00:15:26,385 --> 00:15:27,761
YOU AND SPINNER
WERE NEVER GONNA LAST.

314
00:15:27,845 --> 00:15:29,304
EXCUSE ME?

315
00:15:29,388 --> 00:15:31,640
WHY WOULD YOU WANNA BE
WITH A BORING CHRISTIAN GUY?

316
00:15:31,723 --> 00:15:33,141
WHEN INSIDE OF YOU

317
00:15:33,225 --> 00:15:35,602
THERE'S A SEXY CHICK
TRYING TO BUST OUT?

318
00:15:41,733 --> 00:15:43,902
I WAS TRYING TO HELP YOU,
DARCY.

319
00:15:43,986 --> 00:15:45,487
SPINNER JUST DOESN'T
GET YOU.

320
00:15:45,571 --> 00:15:46,947
AND YOU DO?

321
00:15:47,573 --> 00:15:48,866
YOU'RE NOTHING TO ME,
PETER.

322
00:15:48,949 --> 00:15:50,784
NEVER HAVE BEEN.

323
00:15:51,493 --> 00:15:53,704
YEAH,
NOT LIKE ADAMS.

324
00:15:54,621 --> 00:15:56,999
DID YOU REALLY BUY THAT CRAP
I TOLD YOU ABOUT HIM?

325
00:15:57,082 --> 00:15:58,584
I MET ADAMS IN A CHATROOM.

326
00:15:58,667 --> 00:16:00,836
HE'S JUST SOME BORED,
LONELY LOSER...

327
00:16:00,919 --> 00:16:01,712
WITH MONEY.

328
00:16:02,045 --> 00:16:05,841
BUT I THOUGHT...
HE SAID...

329
00:16:05,924 --> 00:16:07,176
LIES.

330
00:16:07,259 --> 00:16:09,344
A LOT OF LIES.

331
00:16:09,428 --> 00:16:10,679
HE PLAYED YOU, DARCY.

332
00:16:10,762 --> 00:16:13,265
JUST LIKE YOU
PLAYED ME.

333
00:16:22,941 --> 00:16:24,693
YOU'RE QUIET TODAY.

334
00:16:24,776 --> 00:16:26,445
IS IT ABOUT
THE PICTURES?

335
00:16:26,528 --> 00:16:28,655
CLARE, YOU DIDN'T
LOOK AT THEM?

336
00:16:28,739 --> 00:16:29,740
THEY WERE ON
OUR COMPUTER.

337
00:16:29,823 --> 00:16:31,617
IF YOU DIDN'T WANT ME
TO SEE THEM...

338
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:32,868
JUST PROMISE,

339
00:16:32,951 --> 00:16:35,204
DON'T EVER DO SOMETHING
LIKE THAT, OKAY?

340
00:16:35,287 --> 00:16:38,498
WHAT DO YOU THINK I AM,
FIVE?

341
00:16:38,582 --> 00:16:39,625
ADAMS:
DARCY?

342
00:16:40,209 --> 00:16:40,459
HI.

343
00:16:43,962 --> 00:16:45,214
WHO'S HE?

344
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:47,674
ADAMS:
IT'S ME. ADAMS.

345
00:16:52,638 --> 00:16:53,347
GO INSIDE.

346
00:16:53,430 --> 00:16:54,056
CLARE:
I DON'T LIKE THIS.

347
00:16:54,139 --> 00:16:55,682
GO INSIDE.

348
00:16:55,766 --> 00:16:56,558
HI.

349
00:16:56,642 --> 00:16:58,060
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

350
00:16:58,143 --> 00:17:00,479
HOW'D YOU FIND
WHERE I LIVE?

351
00:17:00,562 --> 00:17:01,939
ADAMS:
JUST A LITTLE DETECTIVE WORK.

352
00:17:02,022 --> 00:17:04,066
YOUR CHEERLEADING PHOTO
HAD THE DEGRASSI LOGO

353
00:17:04,149 --> 00:17:05,192
SO I...

354
00:17:05,275 --> 00:17:07,069
I KINDA FOLLOWED YOU HOME.

355
00:17:07,152 --> 00:17:08,904
I JUST WANTED US
TO MEET.

356
00:17:08,987 --> 00:17:10,572
I THOUGHT WE COULD
GET TO KNOW EACH OTHER,

357
00:17:10,656 --> 00:17:11,740
JUST ONE-ON-ONE?

358
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:16,203
(REALIZING SIGH)

359
00:17:18,288 --> 00:17:19,289
THAT'S A NICE BRACELET.

360
00:17:19,373 --> 00:17:22,042
THANKS, MY BOYFRIEND MADE IT.
(MOUTHS 911)

361
00:17:22,125 --> 00:17:22,918
ADAMS:
OH, SPINNER?

362
00:17:23,001 --> 00:17:24,294
DARCY:
I TOOK DOWN MY PAGE.

363
00:17:24,378 --> 00:17:26,421
OH, I WAS SO SAD.

364
00:17:26,505 --> 00:17:28,090
WHAT HAPPENED?
WHY DID YOU DO THAT?

365
00:17:30,509 --> 00:17:31,343
HELLO, 911?

366
00:17:33,136 --> 00:17:33,971
(LAUGHING)

367
00:17:35,347 --> 00:17:37,349
NEXT PITCH...
ELLIE.

368
00:17:38,517 --> 00:17:39,351
UH... OKAY.

369
00:17:39,434 --> 00:17:42,271
UM...
AS MOST OF YOU KNOW,

370
00:17:42,354 --> 00:17:43,939
AND LOVE TO BUG ME ABOUT,

371
00:17:44,022 --> 00:17:45,315
I'M A FIRST YEAR.

372
00:17:45,399 --> 00:17:49,152
AND I'M A LITTLE FASCINATED
BY THAT OFFICE DOWN THE HALL.

373
00:17:49,236 --> 00:17:51,530
THE SEXUAL HEALTH
OFFICE?

374
00:17:51,613 --> 00:17:52,281
(LAUGHS)

375
00:17:53,532 --> 00:17:54,116
UM, SO...

376
00:17:55,617 --> 00:17:57,828
FOLLOWING IN THE GREAT,
THOUGH FICTIONAL,

377
00:17:57,911 --> 00:17:59,788
STEPS OF CARRIE BRADSHAW,

378
00:17:59,872 --> 00:18:01,456
I'D LIKE TO PITCH A SERIES

379
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:03,417
ON SEXUAL HEALTH
ON CAMPUS.

380
00:18:07,462 --> 00:18:08,463
JESSE:
PASS.

381
00:18:08,547 --> 00:18:08,964
NEXT?

382
00:18:09,715 --> 00:18:11,884
HANG ON,
I'VE DONE RESEARCH.

383
00:18:11,967 --> 00:18:13,010
JESSE:
IT'S OKAY.
WE GET IT.

384
00:18:13,093 --> 00:18:13,719
NEXT?

385
00:18:13,802 --> 00:18:14,678
ELLIE:
I... (NERVOUS LAUGH)

386
00:18:14,761 --> 00:18:16,388
I-I JUST UM...

387
00:18:16,471 --> 00:18:21,059
THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT
WE'RE ALL INFORMED ABOUT SEX.

388
00:18:22,227 --> 00:18:24,271
JESSE:
OUR READERS ARE INFORMED,
FROSH.

389
00:18:24,354 --> 00:18:24,688
BUT...

390
00:18:25,189 --> 00:18:26,315
JESSE:
IT'S DEAD, OKAY?

391
00:18:26,398 --> 00:18:27,482
STOP PITCHING IT.

392
00:18:27,566 --> 00:18:28,400
FREDDIE,
WHAT DO YOU GOT?

393
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:34,865
DARCY:
I... I SHOULD REALLY GO.

394
00:18:34,948 --> 00:18:36,992
WE HAVEN'T EVEN TALKED.

395
00:18:37,075 --> 00:18:39,870
HOW IS SCHOOL?
DO YOU LIKE IT?

396
00:18:39,953 --> 00:18:41,955
YOU MUST HAVE
SO MANY FRIENDS.

397
00:18:42,039 --> 00:18:43,081
I GUESS SO.

398
00:18:43,165 --> 00:18:44,541
I KNOW YOU WOULD.

399
00:18:44,625 --> 00:18:45,584
PRETTY GIRL LIKE YOU,

400
00:18:45,667 --> 00:18:48,837
EVERYONE WANTS TO BE
AROUND YOU.

401
00:18:50,339 --> 00:18:52,633
WAIT! DARCY, COME BACK!

402
00:18:52,716 --> 00:18:53,800
OFFICER:
SHOW ME YOUR HANDS, SIR.

403
00:18:53,884 --> 00:18:54,510
ADAMS:
WE WERE JUST TALKING!

404
00:18:54,593 --> 00:18:55,677
SHOW ME YOUR HANDS!

405
00:18:58,096 --> 00:18:59,765
DARCY,
I THOUGHT YOU LIKED ME?

406
00:19:00,349 --> 00:19:02,851
WE'RE INVESTIGATING A REPORT
OF A TRESPASSER IN THE AREA.

407
00:19:02,935 --> 00:19:03,936
I'M GONNA NEED
TO SEE SOME ID.

408
00:19:04,770 --> 00:19:05,646
DARCY!

409
00:19:05,729 --> 00:19:07,314
OFFICER:
SIR, YOU NEED TO STAY HERE.

410
00:19:07,397 --> 00:19:08,190
NO! NO, I DON'T!

411
00:19:08,273 --> 00:19:09,149
SHE'S MY FRIEND.

412
00:19:09,233 --> 00:19:10,692
TELL THEM THAT
YOU KNOW ME!

413
00:19:10,776 --> 00:19:12,653
DARCY, TELL THEM
I'M YOUR FRIEND!

414
00:19:12,736 --> 00:19:13,654
OFFICER:
YOU'RE COMING WITH ME!

415
00:19:13,737 --> 00:19:14,780
ADAMS:
DARCY!

416
00:19:26,875 --> 00:19:28,210
I WANT TO RESIGN -

417
00:19:28,293 --> 00:19:30,254
FROM THE PAPER
AND US.

418
00:19:30,337 --> 00:19:32,130
SO... GOODBYE.

419
00:19:32,756 --> 00:19:34,132
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

420
00:19:34,216 --> 00:19:35,425
CAN WE DISCUSS THIS?

421
00:19:35,509 --> 00:19:37,678
JESSE, I JUST MADE
A COMPLETE ASS OF MYSELF

422
00:19:37,761 --> 00:19:40,138
AND YOU JUST SAT THERE
WITH NINA AND WATCHED.

423
00:19:40,222 --> 00:19:41,640
NO, I DID NOT.

424
00:19:41,723 --> 00:19:42,808
I WAS TRYING
TO HELP YOU.

425
00:19:42,891 --> 00:19:44,268
WHY DO YOU THINK
I WAS TRYING TO STOP YOU?

426
00:19:44,351 --> 00:19:48,230
BUT YOU JUST KEPT GOING
AND GOING AND GOING.

427
00:19:48,313 --> 00:19:50,816
I DO HAVE
THAT TENDENCY.

428
00:19:52,776 --> 00:19:54,736
WHAT WERE YOU DOING
WITH ALL THAT STUFF ANYWAY?

429
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:56,280
I MEAN...

430
00:19:56,363 --> 00:19:58,490
HOW MUCH BIRTH CONTROL
DO YOU NEED?

431
00:19:58,574 --> 00:20:00,158
NO, JESSE, DON'T.

432
00:20:00,242 --> 00:20:02,578
IT'S NOT FUNNY
AT ALL.

433
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:06,164
YOU KNOW, YOU'RE CUTE
WHEN YOU'RE MORTIFIED.

434
00:20:06,248 --> 00:20:10,544
WELL, REMIND ME TO MORTIFY
MYSELF MORE OFTEN.

435
00:20:12,337 --> 00:20:15,257
REMIND ME WE NEED
TO HAVE A TALK,

436
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:16,967
ABOUT US.

437
00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:18,844
WHERE WE'RE GOING.

438
00:20:18,927 --> 00:20:22,222
THAT IS, IF THERE...
STILL IS AN US?

439
00:20:23,432 --> 00:20:25,767
RESIGNATION CANCELLED.

440
00:20:25,851 --> 00:20:26,768
GOOD.

441
00:20:27,728 --> 00:20:30,397
'CAUSE I WASN'T GONNA
ACCEPT IT ANYWAY.

442
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,482
YOU'RE STUCK WITH ME,
FROSH.

443
00:20:32,566 --> 00:20:34,943
FOR A LONG TIME,
I HOPE.

444
00:20:41,033 --> 00:20:43,619
SO, UM, THEY'RE GONNA
TAKE OUR COMPUTER AWAY

445
00:20:43,702 --> 00:20:44,703
FOR EVIDENCE.

446
00:20:44,786 --> 00:20:47,497
SO IF YOU HAVE ANYTHING
ON THERE...

447
00:20:47,581 --> 00:20:48,749
IT'S OKAY.

448
00:20:48,832 --> 00:20:49,875
DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING?

449
00:20:49,958 --> 00:20:51,418
EMAILS FROM SPINNER
OR SOMETHING?

450
00:20:53,837 --> 00:20:54,963
I DON'T WANNA REMEMBER.

451
00:20:55,964 --> 00:20:57,382
IT'S OKAY, DARCE.

452
00:20:58,300 --> 00:20:58,592
NO.

453
00:21:00,385 --> 00:21:02,554
NO, EVERYONE'S GONNA KNOW,
AT SCHOOL,

454
00:21:03,639 --> 00:21:05,641
ABOUT HOW I'M A HYPOCRITE.

455
00:21:05,724 --> 00:21:07,518
NOBODY'S GONNA FIND OUT.

456
00:21:07,601 --> 00:21:08,936
I'LL PUNCH THEM.

457
00:21:12,105 --> 00:21:13,899
YOU'RE GOOD, CLARE.

458
00:21:13,982 --> 00:21:15,234
YOU'RE REALLY GOOD.

459
00:21:15,317 --> 00:21:16,485
YOU ARE TOO, DARCE.

460
00:21:16,568 --> 00:21:19,655
YOU JUST GOT A LITTLE
TURNED AROUND IS ALL.

461
00:21:19,738 --> 00:21:23,492
I THINK IT'S A TEENSY BIT
MORE COMPLICATED THEN THAT.

462
00:21:23,575 --> 00:21:25,327
I'M PRETTY MIXED-UP.

463
00:21:25,410 --> 00:21:26,662
A PERSON CAN BE GOOD
AND MIXED-UP

464
00:21:26,745 --> 00:21:28,997
ALL AT THE SAME TIME.

465
00:21:30,123 --> 00:21:31,041
YEAH?

466
00:21:32,292 --> 00:21:33,210
OKAY.

467
00:21:34,711 --> 00:21:35,838
I HOPE YOU'RE RIGHT.
