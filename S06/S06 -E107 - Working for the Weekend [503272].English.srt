YEAH, TOO HARD!

358
00:16:11,847 --> 00:16:13,932
SPIN...
LOOK, I'VE BEEN THINKING.

359
00:16:14,016 --> 00:16:15,350
MAYBE THIS IS A BAD IDEA.

360
00:16:15,434 --> 00:16:17,477
MAYBE MY DAD WAS RIGHT?

361
00:16:17,561 --> 00:16:18,770
NO, HE WAS WRONG.

362
00:16:18,854 --> 00:16:20,856
AND WE'LL SEE JUST HOW WRONG
AND LAUGH

363
00:16:20,939 --> 00:16:22,274
IN 10 YEARS,

364
00:16:22,357 --> 00:16:25,152
WHEN WE'RE SIPPING COGNAC
ON OUR FLY COMPANY YACHT.

365
00:16:25,235 --> 00:16:26,737
SPINNER, WAKE UP!

366
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:28,113
THERE'S NO YACHT,
OKAY?

367
00:16:28,197 --> 00:16:30,782
IN TEN YEARS, I WILL BE
PRACTICING LAW IN NEW YORK

368
00:16:30,866 --> 00:16:32,451
AND YOU WILL BE TWISTING
BALLOON ANIMALS

369
00:16:32,534 --> 00:16:34,036
IN NORTH YORK!

370
00:16:39,625 --> 00:16:41,960
LOOK, LET'S JUST FIX
THESE TAGS, PLEASE,

371
00:16:42,044 --> 00:16:44,046
AND SELL EVERYTHING WE HAVE
ON THE SHELVES,

372
00:16:44,129 --> 00:16:45,047
AND WE'LL BE DONE.

373
00:16:45,130 --> 00:16:48,133
YEAH, YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU DO IT.

374
00:16:48,217 --> 00:16:49,801
I'M ON BREAK.

375
00:16:55,724 --> 00:16:56,308
SIRINA!

376
00:16:58,060 --> 00:17:00,646
SO YOU FINALLY
REMEMBERED MY NAME.

377
00:17:00,729 --> 00:17:03,065
MS. HATZILAKOS TOLD ME.

378
00:17:03,148 --> 00:17:03,690
SHE ALSO TOLD ME

379
00:17:03,774 --> 00:17:07,653
THAT YOU AND I HAVE
TO GET ALONG.

380
00:17:07,736 --> 00:17:08,445
SO...?

381
00:17:10,197 --> 00:17:11,573
GO TEAM GO!

382
00:17:14,618 --> 00:17:16,328
I'M TRYING TO BE NICE HERE.

383
00:17:16,411 --> 00:17:17,496
PLEASE!

384
00:17:17,996 --> 00:17:21,500
YOU KNOW,
YOU'RE NOT FOOLING ANYONE.

385
00:17:21,583 --> 00:17:23,877
YOU'RE A HATEFUL BITCH,
ALEX.

386
00:17:23,961 --> 00:17:27,172
IT'S ALL YOU'RE EVER
GONNA BE.

387
00:17:27,256 --> 00:17:28,632
MS. HATZILAKOS:
ALEX!

388
00:17:28,715 --> 00:17:30,092
MY OFFICE.

389
00:17:31,218 --> 00:17:32,052
NOW!

390
00:17:47,609 --> 00:17:49,027
HEY, WHAT'S UP?

391
00:17:49,111 --> 00:17:50,362
FEEL FREE TO LOOK AROUND.

392
00:17:50,445 --> 00:17:51,613
WE'VE GOT SOME COOL TEES HERE.

393
00:17:51,697 --> 00:17:54,867
SO JUST IGNORE THE PRICES,
I'M STILL FIXING THEM.

394
00:17:54,950 --> 00:17:56,952
IT'S NOT THE TEES
THAT I'M INTERESTED IN.

395
00:18:07,171 --> 00:18:08,589
JIMMY:
HEY!

396
00:18:11,633 --> 00:18:13,051
(GRUNTS OF EFFORT)

397
00:18:13,135 --> 00:18:14,887
JIMMY:
SPINNER! HELP!

398
00:18:31,486 --> 00:18:32,529
(PAINED GROANS)

399
00:18:32,613 --> 00:18:34,448
MOVE AND I BREAK IT
IN HALF.

400
00:18:35,866 --> 00:18:37,534
I OWE YOU ONE.

401
00:18:57,471 --> 00:18:59,056
THEY'RE NOT POISONED.

402
00:18:59,139 --> 00:19:02,392
AND THEY MAKE GREAT
PROJECTILES.

403
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:04,144
(SIGHS)

404
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:06,146
I GOT A WEEK'S
WORTH DETENTION.

405
00:19:06,230 --> 00:19:08,941
THAT SHOULD
MAKE YOU HAPPY.

406
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:12,277
YOU REALLY DON'T REMEMBER,
DO YOU?

407
00:19:12,361 --> 00:19:13,487
AM I IN
THE TWILIGHT ZONE?

408
00:19:13,570 --> 00:19:16,615
NO.
I DON'T KNOW YOU, SIRINA.

409
00:19:16,698 --> 00:19:18,659
TWO YEARS AGO
YOU ALMOST BLINDED ME

410
00:19:18,742 --> 00:19:20,369
WITH A LASER POINTER

411
00:19:20,452 --> 00:19:23,997
DURING MY FIRST
AND LAST DEBATE.

412
00:19:24,081 --> 00:19:27,042
OR HOW ABOUT
WHEN YOU TRIPPED ME

413
00:19:27,125 --> 00:19:29,545
ON THE WAY TO THE CAF.

414
00:19:30,254 --> 00:19:31,797
I SPRAINED MY ANKLE,

415
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:33,841
AND I HAD TO QUIT
THE TEAM.

416
00:19:33,924 --> 00:19:34,842
IT WASN'T PERSONAL.

417
00:19:34,925 --> 00:19:36,176
YOU COULD HAVE
BEEN ANYBODY.

418
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:37,928
BUT IT WAS ME.

419
00:19:38,554 --> 00:19:40,222
A REAL PERSON.

420
00:19:41,974 --> 00:19:43,308
YOU MADE MY LIFE HELL.

421
00:19:43,392 --> 00:19:44,309
AND THE WORST PART?

422
00:19:44,393 --> 00:19:47,646
YOU DON'T EVEN
REMEMBER DOING IT.

423
00:19:58,365 --> 00:20:00,951
COP:
HECK OF A TAKEDOWN THERE,
CHIEF.

424
00:20:01,034 --> 00:20:02,286
YOU GUYS'LL GET
THAT VENDOR'S LICENCE

425
00:20:02,369 --> 00:20:03,871
BEFORE YOU OPEN UP
AGAIN?

426
00:20:03,954 --> 00:20:05,956
JIMMY:
ACTUALLY, WE UH...

427
00:20:06,039 --> 00:20:06,832
WE WON'T NEED IT.

428
00:20:06,915 --> 00:20:09,835
WE'RE GONNA CLOSE SHOP
PERMANENTLY.

429
00:20:13,046 --> 00:20:15,465
COP:
WE'LL BE IN TOUCH.

430
00:20:16,091 --> 00:20:18,886
YOU KNOW, YOU HAVE NO IDEA
HOW LUCKY YOU ARE.

431
00:20:18,969 --> 00:20:20,179
YOU'RE RIGHT.

432
00:20:20,262 --> 00:20:21,597
THAT GUY COULD
HAVE KILLED ME.

433
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:22,764
I'M NOT I'M TALKING
ABOUT THAT.

434
00:20:22,848 --> 00:20:24,516
I'M TALKING ABOUT THIS!

435
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:26,351
LOOK AT THAT DESIGN.

436
00:20:26,435 --> 00:20:28,061
IT'S AWESOME.

437
00:20:28,145 --> 00:20:29,396
PEOPLE LOVE IT.

438
00:20:29,479 --> 00:20:32,858
I WOULD GIVE ANYTHING TO
HAVE WHAT YOU HAVE, JIMMY -

439
00:20:32,941 --> 00:20:33,984
TALENT.

440
00:20:34,651 --> 00:20:36,612
WHO SAYS YOU DON'T?

441
00:20:36,695 --> 00:20:38,155
I JUST WATCHED YOU
TAKE DOWN SOME DUDE

442
00:20:38,238 --> 00:20:39,823
LIKE JACK BAUER IN THERE,
MAN.

443
00:20:39,907 --> 00:20:41,241
THAT WAS SICK.

444
00:20:41,325 --> 00:20:44,328
IF THAT AIN'T TALENT...
DUDE.

445
00:20:44,411 --> 00:20:46,580
YEAH, I GUESS I AM
A CRIME-FIGHTING SUPER STUD.

446
00:20:46,663 --> 00:20:49,166
YOU'RE RIGHT ABOUT THAT.

447
00:20:50,584 --> 00:20:52,920
MR. BROOKS:
OFFICER, WHAT'S-
WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?

448
00:20:53,003 --> 00:20:53,670
WELL, IT SEEMS TO ME

449
00:20:53,754 --> 00:20:56,048
THERE WAS A ROBBERY
IN THIS LOCATION.

450
00:20:56,131 --> 00:20:57,966
HE LOOKS PISSED.

451
00:21:00,344 --> 00:21:00,928
JUST WAIT TILL I TELL HIM

452
00:21:01,011 --> 00:21:02,596
WHERE I GOT THE MONEY
FOR THIS PLACE.

453
00:21:02,679 --> 00:21:05,265
MAN,
I AM A DEAD MAN ROLLING.

454
00:21:05,349 --> 00:21:08,477
DUDE, I JUST FACED DOWN
A ROBBER.

455
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:11,980
I THINK YOU CAN
FACE DOWN YOUR DAD.

456
00:21:12,814 --> 00:21:14,733
THANKS.
I APPRECIATE IT.

457
00:21:18,195 --> 00:21:21,365
JIM, I'M SO RELIEVED
YOU'RE ALL RIGHT.

458
00:21:21,907 --> 00:21:23,784
LET'S GET YOU HOME NOW, OKAY?

459
00:21:23,867 --> 00:21:24,910
OKAY.

460
00:21:24,993 --> 00:21:26,578
DAD, UH... JUST WAIT.

461
00:21:27,579 --> 00:21:28,080
WE GOTTA TALK.
