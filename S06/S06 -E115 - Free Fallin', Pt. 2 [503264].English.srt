I THOUGHT YOU GOT

180
00:08:49,488 --> 00:08:50,239
MMM.

181
00:08:51,782 --> 00:08:53,075
WHAT'S WRONG, PICKY?

182
00:08:53,158 --> 00:08:54,409
I THOUGHT WE WERE
CELEBRATING.

183
00:08:54,493 --> 00:08:56,161
YEAH, WELL, AREN'T SALADS
SUPPOSED TO BE FRESH?

184
00:08:56,245 --> 00:08:57,704
THIS IS DISGUSTING.

185
00:08:57,788 --> 00:08:59,373
WELL, MAYBE IF YOU
TRIED RED MEAT,

186
00:08:59,456 --> 00:09:00,832
YOU WOULDN'T BE
SO CRANKY.

187
00:09:00,916 --> 00:09:03,293
YOU ARE UNBELIEVABLE.

188
00:09:03,377 --> 00:09:06,296
ISN'T SHE?
HUMAN TRASH COMPACTOR.

189
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:07,756
EITHER YOU'RE IN TORONTO
MID-WEEK

190
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,216
OR THIS AIN'T ROOT BEER.

191
00:09:09,299 --> 00:09:10,467
DINNER'S ON ME.

192
00:09:10,551 --> 00:09:12,177
UH... OKAY, MY MOM.

193
00:09:12,261 --> 00:09:16,014
TO ALEX, THE NEWEST SCHOLAR

194
00:09:16,098 --> 00:09:17,891
YOU DROVE THREE HOURS

195
00:09:17,975 --> 00:09:19,893
YEAH, YOU MUST'VE BEEN
THIRSTY.

196
00:09:19,977 --> 00:09:21,812
I DROVE THREE HOURS
FOR A GREAT REASON,

197
00:09:21,895 --> 00:09:24,231
BUT TONIGHT IS ALL ABOUT
MS. A-PLUS,

198
00:09:24,314 --> 00:09:25,566
THE BRIGHTEST NUNEZ EVER.

199
00:09:25,649 --> 00:09:28,068
OH, YOU KNOW SHE TURNED DOWN
PARADISO BISTRO

200
00:09:28,151 --> 00:09:28,944
TO COME HERE.

201
00:09:29,027 --> 00:09:30,195
I'M NOT SAYING
SHE'S PERFECT.

202
00:09:30,279 --> 00:09:31,280
(CHUCKLES)

203
00:09:31,363 --> 00:09:32,906
SHOULD I LEAVE
YOU TWO ALONE?

204
00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:33,949
PAIGE:
YEAH, WELL,
I WANNA HEAR

205
00:09:34,032 --> 00:09:35,242
ALL ABOUT A DAY
IN THE LIFE

206
00:09:35,325 --> 00:09:36,910
OF AN HONOURS GRAD
MARATHON RUNNER

207
00:09:36,994 --> 00:09:38,078
AT TORONTO U.

208
00:09:38,161 --> 00:09:42,457
WELL, IT'S, IT'S NOT
THAT INTERESTING REALLY.

209
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,466
ALEX:
QUESTION OF THE NIGHT:

210
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:53,260
WHY AREN'T YOU SLEEPING
AT MARCO'S AND DYLAN'S?

211
00:09:53,343 --> 00:09:54,970
WELL, EVERYONE'S BACK
FROM THE WEEKEND;

212
00:09:55,053 --> 00:09:57,097
IT'S A FULL HOUSE.

213
00:09:57,181 --> 00:09:58,640
AND WHY ARE YOU
IN TOWN?

214
00:09:58,724 --> 00:10:03,395
BECAUSE PEOPLE HERE
DON'T ASK A MILLION QUESTIONS?

215
00:10:04,521 --> 00:10:06,773
NICE TRY,
MICHALCHUK.

216
00:10:08,692 --> 00:10:11,278
I DON'T KNOW.
IT WAS SO CHAOTIC

217
00:10:11,361 --> 00:10:14,364
WITH ALL THE FAMILY
AND THE SCHOOLWORK

218
00:10:14,448 --> 00:10:17,326
I WAS JUST
CRAVING SOME HAPPY;

219
00:10:17,409 --> 00:10:18,702
SOME YOU.

220
00:10:21,997 --> 00:10:23,916
HON, WE'RE GONNA STAY
THIS CLOSE FOREVER, RIGHT?

221
00:10:23,999 --> 00:10:25,667
DEPENDS. ARE YOU GONNA
SCREAM AT ME

222
00:10:25,751 --> 00:10:27,628
FROM BEHIND ANY
BATHROOM DOORS?

223
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:30,214
(CHORTLES)
BUT SEE, I DID THAT,

224
00:10:30,297 --> 00:10:33,175
AND THREE DAYS LATER
YOU'RE MAKING ME A COUCH-BED.

225
00:10:33,258 --> 00:10:35,636
I'M CRAZY,
AND YOU'RE SO STRONG.

226
00:10:35,719 --> 00:10:37,554
EVEN PERFECT BANTING GIRLS
NEED TO LET THEIR HAIR DOWN

227
00:10:37,638 --> 00:10:38,972
ONCE IN A WHILE.

228
00:10:39,056 --> 00:10:39,932
(SIGHS)

229
00:10:40,015 --> 00:10:43,977
YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE
WHO HAS ANY IDEA.

230
00:10:44,061 --> 00:10:48,232
WELL, IT'S A SCHOOL NIGHT.
I'LL TUCK YOU IN.

231
00:10:57,741 --> 00:10:58,575
WHAT WAS THAT?

232
00:11:00,077 --> 00:11:00,744
UM...

233
00:11:02,246 --> 00:11:04,081
GOOD NIGHT KISS?

234
00:11:21,807 --> 00:11:22,724
PENANCE WAFFLES?

235
00:11:22,808 --> 00:11:25,644
WITH EXTRA
"I'M SORRY" WHIP.

236
00:11:26,562 --> 00:11:27,980
AND "I WOULD
NEVER INTENTIONALLY

237
00:11:28,063 --> 00:11:30,524
PLAY WITH YOUR FEELINGS"
STRAWBERRIES.

238
00:11:30,607 --> 00:11:31,900
MY FOOD USUALLY
ONLY SAYS,

239
00:11:31,984 --> 00:11:32,568
"EAT ME."

240
00:11:33,318 --> 00:11:35,571
WELL YOUR MOM AND CHAD
CALLED THEM

241
00:11:35,654 --> 00:11:38,073
"LITTLE PUFFS OF HEAVEN."

242
00:11:38,156 --> 00:11:39,658
AND THEY WERE MADE
BY SUCH AN ANGEL.

243
00:11:43,871 --> 00:11:44,580
ARE WE GOING TO
TALK ABOUT

244
00:11:44,663 --> 00:11:45,581
WHAT THAT LITTLE
SMOOCHY-SMOOCH

245
00:11:45,664 --> 00:11:46,999
WAS ALL ABOUT
LAST NIGHT?

246
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:50,169
OH, YOU MEAN THAT THING
THAT NEVER HAPPENED?

247
00:11:51,587 --> 00:11:52,004
OKAY...

248
00:11:54,339 --> 00:11:56,216
YOU'VE DRIVEN HERE
TWICE THIS WEEK.

249
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:58,135
AND FOR WHAT?
TO COOK A COUPLE OF MEALS?

250
00:11:58,844 --> 00:12:00,554
IT SEEMS KINDA STRANGE,

251
00:12:00,637 --> 00:12:02,014
EVEN FOR YOU.

252
00:12:02,097 --> 00:12:05,225
OKAY, VERONICA MARS,
I MISS HOME.

253
00:12:05,309 --> 00:12:07,436
(SCOFFS) OKAY,
WHAT'S IN THESE WAFFLES?

254
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:09,271
PAIGE:
NOTHING. I'M JUST...

255
00:12:09,354 --> 00:12:11,773
I'M HAPPY,
AND I HAVE A PLAN.

256
00:12:11,857 --> 00:12:13,442
IS TONIGHT STILL
KARAOKE NIGHT?

257
00:12:14,443 --> 00:12:15,277
UH HUH.

258
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,571
PAIGE:
WELL, THEN ROUND UP
THE TROOPS.

259
00:12:17,654 --> 00:12:20,032
I HAVE A FEELING
I'LL NEED TO CELEBRATE.

260
00:12:20,115 --> 00:12:22,743
I KNEW I WASN'T THE ONLY REASON
YOU CAME BACK.

261
00:12:22,826 --> 00:12:23,869
DO I EVEN GET A HINT?

262
00:12:34,087 --> 00:12:36,215
HERE. THE REVEREND
HOPES TO SEE YOU

263
00:12:36,298 --> 00:12:37,966
AT THE NEXT SOUP KITCHEN.

264
00:12:38,050 --> 00:12:39,968
WAIT, DARCY,
I HATE SOUP.

265
00:12:40,052 --> 00:12:42,054
I HATE DOG TURDS

266
00:12:42,137 --> 00:12:43,972
BUT I LIKE YOU.

267
00:12:44,056 --> 00:12:44,765
I HAVE FUN WITH YOU.

268
00:12:44,848 --> 00:12:45,974
YOU'RE UNDER
HOUSE ARREST.

269
00:12:46,058 --> 00:12:48,477
I'VE GOT SPIRIT SQUAD,

273
00:12:53,607 --> 00:12:54,566

SO, I WAS HOPING
I COULD TRANSFER.

278
00:13:13,085 --> 00:13:15,838
WE'LL NEED YOUR BANTING
TRANSCRIPTS.

279
00:13:15,921 --> 00:13:19,049
EVEN IF I TAKE
A DIFFERENT PROGRAM?

280
00:13:19,132 --> 00:13:20,175
YEAH.

281
00:13:20,259 --> 00:13:23,011
UNLESS YOU WANNA REAPPLY
FOR THE FALL.

282
00:13:23,095 --> 00:13:24,429
NEXT FALL?

283
00:13:24,930 --> 00:13:26,557
MY MOM WILL DIE -

284
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:28,433

00:13:44,449 --> 00:13:46,201
BANTING HAS TURNED ME

294
00:13:46,285 --> 00:13:49,663
A CHUNKY, ESSAY-FLUNKING

304

00:16:22,441 --> 00:16:23,317
THAT'S IT?

351
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:26,528
PAIGE:
BANTING WAS GREAT FOR MY MOM,
BUT...

352
00:16:26,612 --> 00:16:27,946
I HAVE CONNECTIONS HERE.

353
00:16:29,489 --> 00:16:30,490
CONNECTIONS?

354
00:16:31,366 --> 00:16:32,659
BY THAT YOU MEAN...?

355
00:16:32,743 --> 00:16:33,994
MY FRIENDS,

356
00:16:34,077 --> 00:16:36,705
PEOPLE WHO THINK
I COUNT FOR SOMETHING.

357
00:16:36,788 --> 00:16:37,789
COOL PEOPLE.

358
00:16:38,707 --> 00:16:39,625
OH...

359
00:16:39,708 --> 00:16:41,043
MY PINCHY BOOTS.

360
00:16:41,126 --> 00:16:44,379
UM... THERE SHOULD BE
PAPER TOWELS IN HERE SOMEWHERE.

361
00:16:44,463 --> 00:16:46,632
MY DAD WENT ALL BOY SCOUT
WHEN I GOT THE CAR.

362
00:16:57,351 --> 00:16:58,936
(SIGHS)
DID YOU FIND ANYTHING?

363
00:16:59,019 --> 00:16:59,436
YEAH.

364
00:17:02,814 --> 00:17:03,732
I SURE DID.

365
00:17:07,819 --> 00:17:08,403
UGH! EW!

366
00:17:13,742 --> 00:17:15,327
PETER:
OKAY. BYE, DAD.

367
00:17:18,580 --> 00:17:20,207
HERE.
IT'S A DAY-TIMER.

368
00:17:20,290 --> 00:17:22,084
I WROTE DOWN
ALL MY FREE TIME THIS WEEK.

369
00:17:22,167 --> 00:17:24,336
YOU DO THE SAME
AND THAT'S WHEN I'LL SEE YOU.

370
00:17:24,419 --> 00:17:26,046
COOL! THANKS.

371
00:17:26,129 --> 00:17:28,757
OH, SO YOU'RE FREE TODAY
AFTER SCHOOL?

372
00:17:28,841 --> 00:17:30,092
I HAVE AN HOUR
BEFORE I HAVE TO REPORT

373
00:17:30,175 --> 00:17:31,635
TO MY PROBATION OFFICER.

374
00:17:31,718 --> 00:17:33,220
IT'S A DATE.

375
00:17:33,929 --> 00:17:36,348
MRS. HATZILAKOS:
OH. HERE YOU GO.

376
00:17:36,431 --> 00:17:37,307
WHAT'S THIS?

377
00:17:37,391 --> 00:17:39,059
DIRECTIONS TO A
"CONVICTED STREET RACERS"

378
00:17:39,142 --> 00:17:40,686
PRESS CONFERENCE
AFTER SCHOOL.

379
00:17:40,769 --> 00:17:42,479
I VOLUNTEERED YOU
TO GIVE AN APOLOGY.

380
00:17:42,563 --> 00:17:45,023
TODAY?
YOU'VE GOT TO BE JOKING.

381
00:17:45,107 --> 00:17:46,942
AND IF YOU'RE THINKING
ON SKIPPING, DON'T.

382
00:17:47,025 --> 00:17:48,193
I'LL BE THERE.

383
00:17:51,446 --> 00:17:52,197
TRASHMAN?

384
00:17:54,575 --> 00:17:55,284
FORGET SOMETHING?

385
00:17:55,367 --> 00:17:57,035
PETER:
YEAH, CAN'T LIVE WITHOUT THIS.

386
00:17:57,119 --> 00:17:57,870
AND YOUR UNCLE'S
LOOKING FORWARD

387
00:17:57,953 --> 00:17:59,079
TO SOME SQUEAKY CLEAN DISHES

388
00:17:59,162 --> 00:18:00,581
AT HIS RESTAURANT
THIS WEEKEND.

389
00:18:00,664 --> 00:18:03,292
PETER:
YEAH, AND EVERY OTHER WEEKEND.
I KNOW.

390
00:18:03,375 --> 00:18:04,626
YOU KNOW ANOTHER WAY
TO MAKE THE FIVE GRAND

391
00:18:04,710 --> 00:18:06,378
IT COST ME TO GET THE CAR
OUT OF IMPOUND?

392
00:18:07,671 --> 00:18:08,797
MAYBE YOUR MOTHER'LL
TAKE A CUT

393
00:18:08,881 --> 00:18:10,549
TO HER ALIMONY PAYMENTS.

394
00:18:11,592 --> 00:18:13,218
LOVE YOU TOO!

395
00:18:14,178 --> 00:18:16,847
MY OFFICE,
3:00 SHARP!

396
00:18:19,391 --> 00:18:20,976
YEAH,
YOU WERE RIGHT.

397
00:18:21,059 --> 00:18:22,060
THIS ISN'T GOING TO WORK.

398
00:18:25,939 --> 00:18:26,565
(SIGHS)

399
00:18:27,482 --> 00:18:30,152
PAIGE:
TWO BEDROOM,
ON THE SUBWAY LINE.

400
00:18:30,235 --> 00:18:31,945
TWELVE HUNDRED.
OUCH.

401
00:18:32,029 --> 00:18:33,405
TWO BEDROOM?

402
00:18:33,488 --> 00:18:34,740
ISN'T IT TIME
YOU GAVE YOUR MOM

403
00:18:34,823 --> 00:18:38,076
AND CHAD
THEIR PERSONAL SPACE?

404
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,912
HON, ARE YOU WAITING
FOR SOMEONE?

405
00:18:39,995 --> 00:18:40,954
MAYBE.

406
00:18:41,038 --> 00:18:42,372
WHO, CARLA?

407
00:18:42,456 --> 00:18:46,627
LOOK, IF WE MOVE IN TOGETHER,
IT DOESN'T MEAN...

408
00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:47,544
MOM?

409
00:18:48,545 --> 00:18:50,339
HI.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

410
00:18:50,422 --> 00:18:51,548
WE NEED TO TALK,
PAIGE.

411
00:18:51,632 --> 00:18:53,217
YOU HAVE SOME
EXPLAINING TO DO.

412
00:18:55,719 --> 00:18:57,012
WHAT'S GOING ON?

413
00:18:57,095 --> 00:18:59,681
ALEX FOUND SOME ESSAYS,
SOME TESTS, IN YOUR CAR.

414
00:19:00,891 --> 00:19:01,892
YOU DID THIS?

415
00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:05,270
I'LL LET YOU GUYS TALK.

416
00:19:11,527 --> 00:19:13,529
(PANICKY BREATHS)

417
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:19,743
(INAUDIBLE ANNOUNCEMENT
ON THE P.A.)

418
00:19:20,285 --> 00:19:22,204
DARCY:
THOUGHT I'D FIND YOU HERE.

419
00:19:22,287 --> 00:19:24,122
YEAH, I'M FORMING
A PERMANENT BUTT-GROOVE.

420
00:19:24,206 --> 00:19:25,624
WHY ARE YOU HERE?

421
00:19:25,707 --> 00:19:26,792
(SIGHS)

422
00:19:28,502 --> 00:19:31,421
JUST SEEING YOUR PARENTS,
THE WAY FIGHT...

423
00:19:31,505 --> 00:19:32,130
IT MUST BE HORRIBLE

424
00:19:32,214 --> 00:19:34,466
TO FEEL LIKE
THEY'RE ALWAYS ANGRY.

425
00:19:34,550 --> 00:19:37,135
JUST NOT A GREAT EXAMPLE
OF LOVE, I GUESS.

426
00:19:37,219 --> 00:19:39,638
I KNOW SOMEONE WHO HAS
A LOT OF LOVE TO GIVE.

427
00:19:39,721 --> 00:19:40,556
OKAY, NO OFFENCE,

428
00:19:40,639 --> 00:19:44,810
BUT YOU BETTER NOT BE
TALKING ABOUT JESUS.

429
00:19:46,979 --> 00:19:49,982
DARCE, I'M GONNA BE LATE
TO PICK YOU UP.

430
00:19:50,065 --> 00:19:51,483
I'M GONNA BAIL ON DATES.

431
00:19:51,567 --> 00:19:52,484
ALL THE DAY PLANNERS
IN THE WORLD

432
00:19:52,568 --> 00:19:54,778
CAN'T CHANGE THAT.

433
00:19:54,862 --> 00:19:56,488
BUT I'LL NEVER STOP
THINKING ABOUT YOU.

434
00:19:56,572 --> 00:19:57,948
I HOPE NOT.

435
00:19:58,657 --> 00:20:00,409
AND IF YOU EVER HURT ME?

436
00:20:00,492 --> 00:20:01,702
I'LL TELL YOUR MOM.

437
00:20:01,785 --> 00:20:02,870
(PLAYFUL HUFF)

438
00:20:19,469 --> 00:20:21,430
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU TOLD MY MOTHER!

439
00:20:21,513 --> 00:20:22,431
WHO ELSE WOULD I TELL?

440
00:20:22,514 --> 00:20:25,601
(STAMMERS)
I DON'T KNOW!
NOBODY?

441
00:20:25,684 --> 00:20:27,436
YOU NEED HELP,
PAIGE.

442
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:30,105
AND YOU NEEDED TO TELL
THE TRUTH TO SOMEONE.

443
00:20:30,189 --> 00:20:32,441
IT WAS THE ONLY WAY
TO FORCE IT OUT.

444
00:20:32,524 --> 00:20:34,902
WELL, WHY DIDN'T YOU
TALK TO ME FIRST?

445
00:20:34,985 --> 00:20:36,195
PAIGE,
YOU'VE BEEN LYING TO ME

446
00:20:36,278 --> 00:20:38,780
EVER SINCE YOU GOT HERE,

447
00:20:39,448 --> 00:20:41,825
AND I HAVE NO IDEA WHY.

448
00:20:47,789 --> 00:20:49,833
I'VE ALWAYS
KIND OF FELT LIKE...

449
00:20:49,917 --> 00:20:51,543
YOU LOOKED UP TO ME.

450
00:20:51,627 --> 00:20:53,754
AND I WANT YOU
TO BE PROUD OF ME,

451
00:20:53,837 --> 00:20:56,673
BUT THE TRUTH IS
I'M JUST A...

452
00:20:57,341 --> 00:20:58,717
A LOSER.

453
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:01,094
AND YOU USED ME TO PULL
SOME BIG, CRAZY SCAM?

454
00:21:01,178 --> 00:21:02,679
(SIGHS)
I'M SORRY, ALEX.

455
00:21:02,763 --> 00:21:04,556
I DIDN'T KNOW WHO ELSE
TO TURN TO.

456
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:05,891
WELL, NEXT TIME
YOU NEED A SAFETY NET,

457
00:21:05,974 --> 00:21:08,560
CALL THE FIRE DEPARTMENT.

458
00:21:09,686 --> 00:21:13,106
ACTUALLY, THEY'LL PROBABLY
BE CALLING ME.

459
00:21:15,150 --> 00:21:16,944
I KINDA BURNED DOWN
MY DORM ROOM.

460
00:21:18,987 --> 00:21:19,821
SERIOUSLY?

461
00:21:22,366 --> 00:21:22,699
WOW.

462
00:21:23,659 --> 00:21:25,869
WHEN YOU FLAME OUT,
YOU REALLY FLAME OUT.

463
00:21:26,995 --> 00:21:27,955
WHAT AM I GONNA DO?

464
00:21:30,082 --> 00:21:31,416
THAT'S THE THING, MISSY,

465
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:32,668
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO?
