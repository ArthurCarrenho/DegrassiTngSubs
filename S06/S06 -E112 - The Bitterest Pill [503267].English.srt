181
00:08:05,068 --> 00:08:05,944
VERY ARTICULATE.

182
00:08:06,028 --> 00:08:06,904
CAN I QUOTE YOU?

183
00:08:09,031 --> 00:08:10,324
ANYTHING ELSE TO SAY?

184
00:08:10,407 --> 00:08:13,660
THERE'S KIND OF AN EXPECTED
RESPONSE HERE.

185
00:08:13,744 --> 00:08:16,455
THREE WORDS?
BEGINS WITH I?

186
00:08:18,624 --> 00:08:20,501
I KISSED CRAIG.

187
00:08:20,584 --> 00:08:21,668
YOU WHAT?

188
00:08:21,752 --> 00:08:23,670
I'M SORRY, JESSE.

189
00:08:23,754 --> 00:08:25,756
I HAD TO TELL YOU.

190
00:08:27,925 --> 00:08:30,093
PLEASE DON'T BE MAD.

191
00:08:30,761 --> 00:08:31,220
WHEN I SAW HIM

192
00:08:31,303 --> 00:08:33,931
ALL THESE FEELINGS
CAME RUSHING BACK.

193
00:08:34,014 --> 00:08:38,268
BUT IT'S TOTALLY,
COMPLETELY OVER BETWEEN US.

194
00:08:39,019 --> 00:08:40,979
I GET IT.
CRAIG MEANT A LOT TO YOU.

195
00:08:41,063 --> 00:08:42,564
I'M NOT MAD.

196
00:08:43,774 --> 00:08:45,901
SHOULDN'T YOU BE?

197
00:08:45,984 --> 00:08:48,737
I MEAN...
EVEN JUST A LITTLE?

198
00:08:50,739 --> 00:08:53,992
THOSE WHO LIVE
IN GLASS HOUSES...

199
00:08:56,495 --> 00:08:59,289
LOOK, I HAVEN'T SEEN YOU
IN WEEKS, ELLIE.

200
00:08:59,373 --> 00:09:02,376
I DIDN'T KNOW
WHICH WAY WAS UP.

201
00:09:04,419 --> 00:09:07,798
THE OTHER NIGHT
I WAS AT A BAR AND...

202
00:09:08,549 --> 00:09:10,717
THERE WAS THIS GIRL...

203
00:09:12,344 --> 00:09:15,514
LET'S JUST SAY
I MADE A MISTAKE.

204
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:19,893
WHAT...
WHAT KIND OF MISTAKE?

205
00:09:19,977 --> 00:09:21,228
HOW BAD?

206
00:09:21,311 --> 00:09:25,023
NOT THE WORST,
BUT... BAD.

207
00:09:25,107 --> 00:09:27,150
LOOK,
YOU WERE HONEST WITH ME,

208
00:09:27,234 --> 00:09:29,778
I FELT I OWED IT TO YOU.

209
00:09:29,862 --> 00:09:32,865
I DON'T NEED
YOUR GUILT PRIZE.

210
00:09:39,538 --> 00:09:40,956
ARE YOU SURE
ABOUT THIS?

211
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:42,583
YOU KNOW,
CUTTING CLASS?

212
00:09:42,666 --> 00:09:43,750
LIBERTY, COME ON!

213
00:09:43,834 --> 00:09:45,502
IT'LL BE LIKE
A MINI-VACATION!

214
00:09:45,586 --> 00:09:47,421
JUST ME AND YOU!

215
00:09:49,464 --> 00:09:51,633
(ENGINE ROARS,
CAR STALLS)

216
00:09:52,885 --> 00:09:54,553
DAMN YOU,
BUBBIE'S CAR!

217
00:09:54,636 --> 00:09:57,222
YOU STUPID PIECE
OF JUNK!

218
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:02,269
EVERY SINGLE TIME
I DRIVE YOU...

219
00:10:02,352 --> 00:10:04,313
YOU BREAK,
GODDAMN YOU!

220
00:10:06,899 --> 00:10:08,108
THIS IS FUNNY TO YOU?

221
00:10:08,192 --> 00:10:09,902
ACTUALLY, IT REALLY IS.

222
00:10:09,985 --> 00:10:10,694
(GIGGLES)

223
00:10:11,737 --> 00:10:14,448
LOOK, I JUST THOUGHT
THAT WE COULD GET AWAY,

224
00:10:14,531 --> 00:10:16,283
MAYBE YOU'D FEEL BETTER.

225
00:10:16,366 --> 00:10:17,743
WELL, IT WORKED.

226
00:10:17,826 --> 00:10:20,370
MAYBE NOT FOR THE REASONS
YOU INTENDED...

227
00:10:20,454 --> 00:10:23,207
YEAH, YOUR BUBBIE'S GOING TO BE
REALLY MAD AT YOU FOR THIS.

228
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:24,124
(CHUCKLES)

229
00:10:24,208 --> 00:10:25,709
SEE?
YOU'RE LAUGHING.

230
00:10:25,792 --> 00:10:27,336
THAT'S GOOD.

231
00:10:27,419 --> 00:10:30,297
AT LEAST I DIDN'T
TOTALLY FAIL.

232
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:32,883
NO, YOU DIDN'T FAIL.

233
00:10:32,966 --> 00:10:35,302
YOU'RE AMAZING,
TRULY.

234
00:10:55,822 --> 00:10:57,741
(NERVOUS CHUCKLE)

235
00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:08,710
GOTTA THANK YOU, DUDE,
FOR LOOKING AFTER LIBERTY.

236
00:11:08,794 --> 00:11:10,879
LAST NIGHT, SHE KEPT GOING ON
ABOUT YOUR LITTLE ROAD TRIP.

237
00:11:10,963 --> 00:11:12,881
AH, IT WAS NO BIG THING.

238
00:11:12,965 --> 00:11:14,466
IT WAS TO HER.

239
00:11:17,094 --> 00:11:18,929
MORNING, TOBY.

240
00:11:19,012 --> 00:11:20,180
MORNING.

241
00:11:23,016 --> 00:11:24,601
IF I DIDN'T KNOW
ANY BETTER,

242
00:11:24,685 --> 00:11:25,936
I'D THINK SOMETHING
WAS GOING DOWN

243
00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:27,312
BETWEEN YOU
AND MY SISTER.

244
00:11:27,396 --> 00:11:29,898
WHAT? NO. COME ON!
THAT'S CRAZY TALK.

245
00:11:29,982 --> 00:11:31,817
GOOD. CAUSE IF NOT,

246
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:33,652
DANNY WOULD HAVE
TO CHOKE A DUDE.

247
00:11:33,735 --> 00:11:37,030
DOES DANNY HAVE TO CHOKE
A DUDE, TOBY?

248
00:11:37,114 --> 00:11:38,532
RELAX, MAN.

249
00:11:38,615 --> 00:11:40,242
WE'RE JUST FRIENDS.

250
00:11:43,662 --> 00:11:44,913
(RELIEVED EXHALE)

251
00:11:49,418 --> 00:11:51,670
TELL ME HE'S BEING
A PARANOID FREAK.

252
00:11:51,753 --> 00:11:52,838
FREAK, YES.

253
00:11:52,921 --> 00:11:55,174
PARANOID?
NOT SO MUCH.

254
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:58,177
I KISSED LIBERTY.

255
00:11:58,260 --> 00:11:59,428
OWWW!

256
00:11:59,511 --> 00:12:00,387
ARE YOU CUCKOO-BANANAS?

257
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:02,222
NO! WELL, YEAH.

258
00:12:02,890 --> 00:12:03,974
I DON'T KNOW.
AM I?

259
00:12:04,057 --> 00:12:05,225
YES!

260
00:12:05,309 --> 00:12:06,768
TOBY:
WHAT? WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

261
00:12:09,396 --> 00:12:10,022
WHY ON EARTH

262
00:12:10,105 --> 00:12:12,441
WOULD YOU DO SOMETHING
SO RIDICULOUSLY STUPID?

263
00:12:12,524 --> 00:12:13,609
TOBY:
BECAUSE I LIKE HER, MANNY.

264
00:12:13,692 --> 00:12:15,777
BECAUSE SHE'S CUTE
AND SHE'S SWEET AND SAD

265
00:12:15,861 --> 00:12:17,070
AND SHE NEEDS ME.

266
00:12:17,154 --> 00:12:18,697
AND YOU WANNA BE HER KNIGHT
IN SHINING ARMOR.

267
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:20,032
WELL, IT'S WRONG.

268
00:12:20,115 --> 00:12:21,533
BOTH OF YOU ARE
A MESS RIGHT NOW.

269
00:12:21,617 --> 00:12:24,870
THIS IS THE WORST
POSSIBLE TIME.

270
00:12:24,953 --> 00:12:25,913
TOBY...

271
00:12:26,955 --> 00:12:29,124
YOU JUST BURIED
YOUR FRIEND.

272
00:12:29,208 --> 00:12:30,375
A FRIEND WHO STILL
HAD FEELINGS

273
00:12:30,459 --> 00:12:31,668
FOR THE GIRL
YOU JUST KISSED.

274
00:12:31,752 --> 00:12:32,878
I KNOW, MANNY.
I KNOW.

275
00:12:32,961 --> 00:12:34,546
AND I COULDN'T FEEL GUILTIER,
BELIEVE ME.

276
00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:36,215
BUT WHAT NOW?

277
00:12:36,298 --> 00:12:37,549
WHAT CAN I DO?

278
00:12:37,633 --> 00:12:39,343
TAKE THE KISS BACK.

279
00:12:39,426 --> 00:12:40,427
WHAT?!

280
00:12:41,094 --> 00:12:42,596
H-HOW?
GET IN A TIME MACHINE?

281
00:12:42,679 --> 00:12:43,555
TELL HER
YOU DIDN'T MEAN IT.

282
00:12:43,639 --> 00:12:45,057
TELL HER YOU WERE ON CRACK,
WHATEVER.

283
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:47,142
JUST TAKE IT BACK.

284
00:12:47,893 --> 00:12:49,811
FINE. FINE.
I WILL.

285
00:12:49,895 --> 00:12:52,523
I'LL ISSUE AN OFFICIAL
KISS RETRACTION.

286
00:12:52,606 --> 00:12:53,524
HAPPY?

287
00:13:03,992 --> 00:13:04,409
WHAT'S THAT?

288
00:13:04,493 --> 00:13:05,577
GUESS.

289
00:13:06,119 --> 00:13:07,412
ELLIE, WAIT!

290
00:13:07,496 --> 00:13:08,247
HEY! HEY!

291
00:13:08,747 --> 00:13:09,915
HOLD ON!

292
00:13:11,375 --> 00:13:12,584
DON'T JUST THROW THIS AWAY,
OKAY?

293
00:13:12,668 --> 00:13:13,877
WE BOTH MADE A MISTAKE.

294
00:13:13,961 --> 00:13:15,128
REALLY?

295
00:13:15,212 --> 00:13:16,922
I KISSED SOMEONE.

296
00:13:17,005 --> 00:13:20,717
YOU HAD A RANDOM HOOKUP
WITH SOME BAR SKANK.

297
00:13:20,801 --> 00:13:22,511
I DIDN'T HAVE SEX
WITH HER, OKAY?

298
00:13:22,594 --> 00:13:24,179
I DON'T CARE.

299
00:13:24,263 --> 00:13:25,389
IT WAS STILL MORE
THAN A KISS.

300
00:13:25,472 --> 00:13:26,723
WAY MORE.

301
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:28,809
YOU KISSED SOME GUY

302
00:13:28,892 --> 00:13:31,186
THAT YOU'VE BEEN CRUSHING ON
SINCE FOREVER.

303
00:13:31,270 --> 00:13:33,772
RIGHT? YOU THINK THAT
DOESN'T HURT, HM?

304
00:13:33,856 --> 00:13:35,190
I'M SORRY.

305
00:13:35,691 --> 00:13:38,235
I'M SORRY, TOO.
OKAY?

306
00:13:38,318 --> 00:13:39,862
SO COULD WE JUST GET
PAST THIS, OKAY?

307
00:13:39,945 --> 00:13:41,321
JUST MOVE ON?

308
00:13:41,405 --> 00:13:43,365
NO, IT'S NOT THAT SIMPLE,
JESSE.

309
00:13:43,448 --> 00:13:45,284
IT CAN'T BE
THAT SIMPLE.

310
00:13:45,367 --> 00:13:46,952
SAYS WHO, HM?

311
00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:49,329
LOOK...

312
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:53,458
DO YOU LOVE ME?

313
00:13:54,376 --> 00:13:57,337
I...WHAT KIND OF QUESTION
IS THAT?

314
00:13:57,421 --> 00:13:58,547
AN IMPORTANT ONE.

315
00:13:58,630 --> 00:14:00,382
MAYBE THE ONLY ONE
THAT MATTERS RIGHT NOW.

316
00:14:00,465 --> 00:14:01,925
I HAVE TO GET
TO THE MEMORIAL.

317
00:14:13,645 --> 00:14:16,732
LIBERTY?
I NEED TO TALK TO YOU.

318
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:21,361
WHAT HAPPENED YESTERDAY
WAS NICE AND EVERYTHING,

319
00:14:21,445 --> 00:14:22,779
BUT WRONG.

320
00:14:23,739 --> 00:14:28,327
AND I WAS WONDERING
IF I COULD TAKE IT BACK?

321
00:14:28,410 --> 00:14:30,037
THE KISS, I MEAN.

322
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:31,580
IT'S NOT A LIBRARY BOOK,
TOBY.

323
00:14:31,663 --> 00:14:33,123
YOU CAN'T JUST RETURN IT.

324
00:14:33,207 --> 00:14:33,957
YEAH, I KNOW.

325
00:14:34,041 --> 00:14:35,834
I WAS JUST HOPING THAT,
IN THIS CASE,

326
00:14:35,918 --> 00:14:38,295
WE COULD MAKE
A SPECIAL EXCEPTION?

327
00:14:38,378 --> 00:14:40,839
TOBY,
DO YOU LIKE ME?

328
00:14:40,923 --> 00:14:43,258
YEAH.
A LOT, ACTUALLY.

329
00:14:44,343 --> 00:14:47,930
WELL, I LIKE YOU, TOO.
PROBLEM SOLVED.

330
00:14:53,101 --> 00:14:53,602
(SIGHS)

331
00:14:55,521 --> 00:14:57,356
SO I'VE HEARD
THERE WAS A WAR

332
00:14:57,439 --> 00:14:58,982
BETWEEN LAKEHURST
AND DEGRASSI.

333
00:14:59,066 --> 00:15:01,443
DO YOU THINK JT
WAS A VICTIM OF THAT?

334
00:15:01,527 --> 00:15:02,361
NO.

335
00:15:02,444 --> 00:15:04,613
I THINK THAT PSYCHO, DRAKE,
WAS A TICKING TIME BOMB,

336
00:15:04,696 --> 00:15:05,489
AND IF IT WASN'T JT,

337
00:15:05,572 --> 00:15:07,366
IT WOULD'VE BEEN
SOMEBODY ELSE.

338
00:15:07,449 --> 00:15:10,619
IT'S JUST SO
IMPOSSIBLY RANDOM.

339
00:15:10,702 --> 00:15:13,372
THING IS,
LIFE IS RANDOM.

340
00:15:14,706 --> 00:15:18,168
SOMETIMES IT'S TRAGIC
AND TOTALLY MESSED UP.

341
00:15:18,252 --> 00:15:20,045
BUT THERE IS ONE THING
THAT MAKES ALL THE DRAMA

342
00:15:20,128 --> 00:15:22,714
AND THE TEARS WORTHWHILE:

343
00:15:24,007 --> 00:15:27,511
IF YOU'RE LUCKY ENOUGH
TO FIND SOMEONE YOU LOVE

344
00:15:27,594 --> 00:15:29,805
WHO LOVES YOU BACK,

345
00:15:29,888 --> 00:15:31,640
IT'S A GIFT.

346
00:15:31,723 --> 00:15:34,309
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYIN'?

347
00:15:37,771 --> 00:15:40,399
YOU'RE A WISE MAN,
JIMMY BROOKS.

348
00:15:40,482 --> 00:15:42,734
DON'T FORGET
GOOD-LOOKING.

349
00:15:42,818 --> 00:15:44,236
HATZILAKOS:
ATTENTION STUDENTS,

350
00:15:44,319 --> 00:15:46,572
PLEASE MAKE YOUR WAY
TO THE GYMNASIUM.

351
00:15:46,655 --> 00:15:50,492
THE JT YORKE MEMORIAL
IS ABOUT TO BEGIN.

352
00:15:58,292 --> 00:16:02,921
SIMPSON:
EVERYONE, MAY I HAVE
YOUR ATTENTION?

353
00:16:03,005 --> 00:16:05,716
WELCOME TO THE JT YORKE
MEMORIAL.

354
00:16:09,595 --> 00:16:11,263
THERE'S A LOT OF US

355
00:16:12,347 --> 00:16:13,807
THAT ARE AFFECTED BY THIS,

356
00:16:13,891 --> 00:16:14,516
BUT UH...

AND I'D LIKE TO START

I WANT TO SHOW MY VIDEO,

368
00:17:03,398 --> 00:17:05,359
BUT LIBERTY SAYS
WE DON'T HAVE TIME.

369
00:17:05,442 --> 00:17:07,319
SHE'S RIGHT.
I'M SORRY, MIA.

370
00:17:07,402 --> 00:17:09,321
GOD! WHY ARE YOU ALWAYS
TAKING HER SIDE?

371
00:17:09,404 --> 00:17:10,989
IT'S NOT ABOUT SIDES,
OKAY?

372
00:17:11,073 --> 00:17:12,991
WHY ARE YOU GETTING
SO UPSET ABOUT THIS?

373
00:17:13,075 --> 00:17:15,327
BECAUSE IT'S THE PRINCIPLE.

374
00:17:15,410 --> 00:17:18,121
WHY DOES LIBERTY GET A SAY
IN ANYTHING TO DO WITH JT?

375
00:17:18,205 --> 00:17:18,997
HE COULDN'T STAND HER.

376
00:17:19,081 --> 00:17:19,831
THAT'S NOT TRUE.

377
00:17:19,915 --> 00:17:21,333
MIA:
OH, REALLY?

378
00:17:21,416 --> 00:17:23,293
YOU KNOW WHAT HE USED TO CALL
HER BEHIND HER BACK?

379
00:17:23,377 --> 00:17:25,254
LIBERTY 3000.

380
00:17:25,337 --> 00:17:26,296
HE TOLD ME HATED HER.

381
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:27,548
FUNNY, BECAUSE I SEEM
TO REMEMBER

382
00:17:27,631 --> 00:17:30,300
HIM TELLING ME
THE EXACT OPPOSITE.

383
00:17:30,384 --> 00:17:31,301
WHAT?

384
00:17:31,802 --> 00:17:33,720
WHEN?
WHEN DID HE SAY THIS?

385
00:17:33,804 --> 00:17:35,347
JUST FORGET I SAID ANYTHING,
PLEASE?

386
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:37,599
NO, NO.
I CAN'T JUST FORGET IT.

387
00:17:37,683 --> 00:17:40,435
I NEED TO KNOW, TOBY.
WHEN?

388
00:17:41,728 --> 00:17:43,772
RIGHT BEFORE HE DIED.

389
00:17:43,856 --> 00:17:45,941
THE THING ABOUT OATMEAL?

390
00:17:46,024 --> 00:17:48,318
HE MEANT LIBERTY.

391
00:17:48,402 --> 00:17:52,114
I'M SORRY, MIA,
BUT HE STILL LIKED HER.

392
00:17:53,657 --> 00:17:55,200
YOU SUCK, ISAACS.

393
00:17:55,284 --> 00:17:57,119
YOU SUCK SO BAD.

394
00:18:03,208 --> 00:18:05,127
GIVE ME THE TAPE.

395
00:18:07,171 --> 00:18:09,673
YOU'RE GOING
TO PLAY IT?

396
00:18:15,596 --> 00:18:18,056
LIBERTY,
WHAT DID YOU HEAR?

397
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:19,558
EVERYTHING.

398
00:18:20,142 --> 00:18:22,311
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU.

399
00:18:25,689 --> 00:18:27,649
LIBERTY!
LIBERTY!

400
00:18:29,735 --> 00:18:31,153
JUST TELL ME WHY?

401
00:18:31,236 --> 00:18:32,529
WHY WOULD YOU WANT
TO HURT ME LIKE THIS?

402
00:18:32,613 --> 00:18:33,572
I DIDN'T WANT
TO HURT YOU.

403
00:18:33,655 --> 00:18:34,656
I WANTED TO HELP YOU!

404
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:37,534
TOBY, YOU KNEW HOW
I FELT ABOUT JT,

405
00:18:37,618 --> 00:18:39,453
AND YOU KNEW HOW MUCH
IT WOULD MEAN TO ME

406
00:18:39,536 --> 00:18:41,455
TO KNOW HE FELT
THE SAME WAY.

407
00:18:41,538 --> 00:18:44,666
LIBERTY, I WAS TRYING
TO PROTECT YOU!

408
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:47,336
AND THAT INVOLVES
KISSING ME?!

409
00:18:47,419 --> 00:18:48,170
THAT'S IDIOTIC!

410
00:18:48,253 --> 00:18:48,670

IT'LL NEVER HAPPEN.
