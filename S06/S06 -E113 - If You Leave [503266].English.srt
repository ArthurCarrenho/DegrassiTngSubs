00:07:31,326 --> 00:07:33,787
I NEVER GET TO SEE YOU.

180
00:07:33,871 --> 00:07:36,707
I JUST REALLY WANT TO TALK
TO YOU, YOU KNOW?

181
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:39,626
WOW. MOST GUYS AREN'T AFTER ME
FOR CONVERSATION.

182
00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:42,254
WELL,
I'M NOT MOST GUYS.

183
00:07:42,337 --> 00:07:43,463
COME ON, MANNY.

184
00:07:43,547 --> 00:07:46,133
HANG OUT WITH ME

(PHONE RINGS)

186
00:07:53,307 --> 00:07:54,474
WHERE ARE YOU?

187
00:07:54,558 --> 00:07:56,268
MANNY:
HEY, EM.

188
00:07:56,852 --> 00:07:58,979
I CAME HOME AFTER
SEEING DAMIAN?

189
00:07:59,062 --> 00:08:01,273
AND MY DAD'S TOTALLY BACK
IN TYRANT MODE.

190
00:08:01,356 --> 00:08:03,567
EMMA:
OH, YOU POOR THING!

191
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:06,028
I'M OKAY. I JUST...
I THINK NEED TO STAY HOME

192
00:08:06,111 --> 00:08:07,571
AND LET IT BLOW OVER?

193
00:08:07,654 --> 00:08:08,947
EMMA:
OKAY.

194
00:08:09,031 --> 00:08:10,407
WELL, I MISS YOU.

195
00:08:11,366 --> 00:08:13,827

I MISS YOU, TOO.

196
00:08:13,911 --> 00:08:14,244

DYLAN:
SORRY, MY SEMINAR WENT LONG.

198
00:08:25,297 --> 00:08:27,633
YOU COULD'VE CALLED.

199
00:08:27,716 --> 00:08:29,510
DYLAN:
PHONE'S DEAD.

200
00:08:29,593 --> 00:08:30,844
OH, SMELLS GREAT,
MARCO.

201
00:08:30,928 --> 00:08:32,387
DID YOU MAKE STEAK?

202
00:08:32,471 --> 00:08:33,597
YEAH.

203
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:35,265
IT'S MY NONA'S
BISTECCA.

204
00:08:35,974 --> 00:08:37,351
YOU KNOW, SUPPOSEDLY,

205
00:08:37,434 --> 00:08:40,312
IT'S THE FASTEST WAY
TO ANY MAN'S HEART.

206
00:08:42,231 --> 00:08:45,192
SO LUCKILY, I CONVINCED
ELLIE TO GO TO THE MOVIES

208
00:08:46,777 --> 00:08:49,196

JUST ME AND YOU.

212
00:08:55,786 --> 00:08:56,537
WELL, WHO KNOWS
WHAT COULD HAPPEN

213
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:58,705

215
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:03,210

217
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:07,548
I GOTTA TAKE THIS.

218
00:09:08,382 --> 00:09:09,550
I THOUGHT YOUR PHONE
WAS DEAD.

219
00:09:10,634 --> 00:09:12,928
I GUESS IT RECOVERED POWER
OR SOMETHING.

220
00:09:13,011 --> 00:09:13,971
FUNNY, HUH?

221
00:09:14,805 --> 00:09:15,305

222
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:19,476

224
00:09:26,191 --> 00:09:27,192
MANNY:
FINE.

225
00:09:28,026 --> 00:09:29,403
THAT'S FUNNY,
YOUR DAD DIDN'T SEEM FINE

226
00:09:29,486 --> 00:09:31,905

LOOKING FOR YOU.

227
00:09:31,989 --> 00:09:33,115

228
00:09:33,198 --> 00:09:35,742

OF COURSE.

229
00:09:35,826 --> 00:09:36,451
I'M NOT SURE WHY,

230
00:09:36,535 --> 00:09:38,495
SINCE YOU TOTALLY
BLEW ME OFF.

231
00:09:38,579 --> 00:09:39,746
I'M SORRY.

232
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:42,291

236
00:09:48,881 --> 00:09:50,757

THEY DESERVE.

237
00:09:51,592 --> 00:09:52,843
HOW GOOD CAN IT BE?

238
00:09:52,926 --> 00:09:54,511
YOU'VE KNOWN HIM

239
00:09:54,595 --> 00:09:55,929
COME FIND OUT.

240
00:09:56,013 --> 00:09:57,639
I'M MEETING HIM
AT THE DOT AFTER SCHOOL.

241
00:09:57,723 --> 00:09:59,766
BRING SEAN, TOO.
I WANT US ALL TO BE FRIENDS.

242
00:09:59,850 --> 00:10:01,768
I'M NOT SURE
THAT'S A GOOD IDEA.

243
00:10:01,852 --> 00:10:04,771
PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE,
PLEASE, PLEASE?!

244
00:10:04,855 --> 00:10:07,232
CLEARLY RESISTANCE
IS FUTILE.

245
00:10:07,316 --> 00:10:10,277

249
00:10:56,323 --> 00:10:59,409

WONDERFUL BEAU, SEAN.

250
00:10:59,493 --> 00:11:01,828
DAMIAN:

251
00:11:03,413 --> 00:11:04,248
SEAN:
HEY...

252
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:08,794
SO, HOW ARE THINGS
AT LAKEHURST?

253
00:11:08,877 --> 00:11:10,128
AH, FINE.

00:11:10,212 --> 00:11:11,547
SEAN:
SERIOUSLY?

255
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:12,339
'CAUSE LAST I HEARD

256
00:11:12,422 --> 00:11:13,966
ONE OF YOUR STUDENTS
WAS IN JAIL.

257

258
00:11:18,011 --> 00:11:19,012
DAMIAN:
LOOK, MAN.

259
00:11:19,096 --> 00:11:22,349
I'M REALLY SORRY
ABOUT YOUR FRIEND JT.

260
00:11:22,432 --> 00:11:25,352
I MEAN,
IT'S A TOTAL TRAGEDY.

261
00:11:26,186 --> 00:11:27,563
DAMIAN.

262
00:11:27,646 --> 00:11:30,774
SO UH, TELL ME,
HOW'S DRAKE DOING?

263
00:11:30,858 --> 00:11:33,360
I HAVE NO IDEA, MIA.

264
00:11:33,443 --> 00:11:35,195
BUT HE'S YOUR FRIEND,
ISN'T HE?

265
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:37,364
NO. THAT'S NOT TRUE.

266
00:11:37,447 --> 00:11:38,991
EXCUSE ME,
BUT I WENT TO LAKEHURST?

267
00:11:39,074 --> 00:11:40,492
SO HOW ABOUT
YOU SAVE YOUR LIES

268
00:11:40,576 --> 00:11:42,911
FOR SOMEONE WHO'LL
BUY THEM?

269
00:11:46,123 --> 00:11:47,749
SO, MANNY,
WHO ARE YOU LOYAL TO?

270
00:11:47,833 --> 00:11:50,043
YOUR DEAD FRIEND
OR YOUR NEW LAKEHURST CRUSH?

271
00:11:50,127 --> 00:11:51,503
LET'S GO, MANNY.

272
00:11:51,587 --> 00:11:52,546
NO, WAIT.

273
00:11:52,629 --> 00:11:55,215
EM, A LITTLE HELP
HERE PLEASE?

274
00:11:55,299 --> 00:11:56,383
WHAT DO YOU WANT ME
TO SAY?

275
00:11:56,466 --> 00:11:59,052
YOU'RE SLEEPING
WITH THE ENEMY.

276
00:11:59,136 --> 00:11:59,803
YOU KNOW WHAT, EMMA?

277
00:11:59,887 --> 00:12:01,013
I'M SO GLAD
I'VE MOVED HOME.

278
00:12:01,096 --> 00:12:02,556

HAVE TO SEE YOUR MEAN,

282
00:12:18,405 --> 00:12:20,073
COME OUT TOMORROW
AND SUPPORT THE SQUAD.

283
00:12:20,157 --> 00:12:21,158
GO DEGRASSI!

284
00:12:22,409 --> 00:12:23,827

IN THE MAKING.

285

286
00:12:24,912 --> 00:12:25,954
MANNY:
THANKS, MR. S.

287
00:12:26,038 --> 00:12:27,164
IT'S ALL ABOUT
PANTHER PRIDE.

288
00:12:27,247 --> 00:12:29,333
WHICH IS SO MUCH MORE
IMPORTANT THAN ACADEMICS

289
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:31,335
OR EVEN ACTUAL SPORTS.

290
00:12:31,418 --> 00:12:32,878
YEAH, IF THE SCHOOL
PRINTED MONEY,

291
00:12:32,961 --> 00:12:34,338
YOUR FACE WOULD BE ON IT.

292
00:12:34,421 --> 00:12:35,339
AND I'D USE IT
TO BUY YOU

293
00:12:35,422 --> 00:12:36,798
A BIG BOX OF SHUT UP.

294
00:12:36,882 --> 00:12:39,176
UH, GIRLS?
CLASS HAS BEGUN.

295
00:12:39,259 --> 00:12:41,011
OKAY. I'D LIKE TO BRING UP
A DISCUSSION TOPIC,

296
00:12:41,094 --> 00:12:42,012
IF I MAY?

297
00:12:42,095 --> 00:12:43,805
FINE.
WHAT IS IT, EM?

298
00:12:44,431 --> 00:12:46,934
IN THE AFTERMATH OF THE DEATH
OF ONE OF OUR CLASSMATES,

299
00:12:47,017 --> 00:12:50,521
WHAT DOES DEFEATING
LAKEHURST PROVE, EXACTLY?

300
00:12:50,604 --> 00:12:52,356
THAT WE'RE BETTER
THAN THEM?

301
00:12:52,439 --> 00:12:54,525
MANNY, OUR ENTIRE SCHOOL
IS IN MOURNING.

302
00:12:54,608 --> 00:12:55,734
AND NOT ONLY THAT,
THERE'S ANGER.

303
00:12:55,817 --> 00:12:57,736
THEY WANT REVENGE.

304
00:12:57,819 --> 00:12:58,695
WHAT DOES THAT
HAVE TO DO

305
00:12:58,779 --> 00:13:00,322
WITH THE SPIRIT SQUAD
COMPETITION?

306
00:13:00,405 --> 00:13:02,199
I THINK WE SHOULD
CANCEL IT.

307
00:13:02,282 --> 00:13:03,700
IT PREVENTS LAKEHURST
FROM SHOWING UP HERE,

308
00:13:03,784 --> 00:13:05,369
FROM REMINDING US
OF OUR LOSS,

309
00:13:05,452 --> 00:13:07,162
AND RUBBING OUR NOSES
IN IT.

310
00:13:07,246 --> 00:13:08,830
AFTER ALL THE HARD WORK
THAT WE'VE PUT INTO IT?

311
00:13:08,914 --> 00:13:10,207
I THINK NOT.

312
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:12,209

ONE YEAR.

00:15:29,346 --> 00:15:30,430
NICE TO MEET YOU.

353
00:15:30,514 --> 00:15:32,808
MARCO:
SORRY I CAN'T SAY THE SAME,
JULIEN.

354
00:15:32,891 --> 00:15:35,269
DID DYLAN HERE
EVEN BOTHER TO TELL YOU

355
00:15:35,936 --> 00:15:37,813
THAT HE'S IN A COMMITTED
RELATIONSHIP OR...?

356
00:15:37,896 --> 00:15:38,689
MARCO, WHOA!

357
00:15:38,772 --> 00:15:39,523
MARCO:
SHUT UP, CURLY.

358
00:15:39,606 --> 00:15:41,024
BECAUSE YOU KNOW HE IS.

359
00:15:41,108 --> 00:15:42,234
OR AT LEAST HE WAS.

360
00:15:42,317 --> 00:15:44,403
BEFORE HE STARTED CHEATING...
AGAIN.

361
00:15:44,486 --> 00:15:46,363
DYLAN:
MARCO, STOP!

362
00:15:46,446 --> 00:15:49,032
JULIEN IS FROM ZURICH HC,

363
00:15:49,575 --> 00:15:51,660
A HOCKEY TEAM
IN SWITZERLAND.

364
00:15:51,743 --> 00:15:53,537
HE'S BEEN SCOUTING ME.

365
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:56,623
THEY WANT ME TO PLAY
FOR THEM.

366
00:15:59,751 --> 00:16:00,669
YEAH.

367
00:16:07,801 --> 00:16:10,179
JUDGE:
LET'S SEE IF LAKEHURST

368
00:16:10,262 --> 00:16:12,306

JUDGE:
(INDISTINCT COMMENT)

384
00:17:03,774 --> 00:17:05,234
IS THIS WHAT
YOU WANTED?

385
00:17:05,317 --> 00:17:07,402
FINALLY FEELING
SELF-RIGHTEOUS ENOUGH?

386
00:17:07,486 --> 00:17:09,238
EMMA:
MANNY, YOU WON.

387
00:17:09,321 --> 00:17:10,697
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?
I SO FEEL MUCH BETTER.

388
00:17:10,781 --> 00:17:12,241
I THINK I CAN ACTUALLY FEEL
THE SCHOOL SPIRIT

389
00:17:12,324 --> 00:17:13,951
COURSING THROUGH MY VEINS.

390
00:17:14,034 --> 00:17:15,118
YEAH,
CALL THE MEDIA.

391
00:17:15,202 --> 00:17:17,204
MANNY SANTOS HAS HEALED
THE ENTIRE SCHOOL!

392
00:17:18,372 --> 00:17:20,541
NOW I KNOW WHY MANNY
WAS YOUR ONLY FRIEND.

393
00:17:20,624 --> 00:17:22,209
SHE'S A SAINT TO PUT UP
WITH YOUR CRAP.

394
00:17:22,709 --> 00:17:24,211
TAKE A BIG STEP BACK,
LAKEHURST GUY.

395
00:17:25,754 --> 00:17:26,839
DAMIAN!

396
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:29,466
HATZILAKOS:
OKAY, THAT'S ENOUGH!
THAT'S ENOUGH!

397
00:17:29,550 --> 00:17:30,175
BREAK IT UP!

398
00:17:30,259 --> 00:17:32,302
I SAID BREAK IT UP!
THAT'S ENOUGH!

399
00:17:32,386 --> 00:17:33,971
BREAK IT UP,
I SAID!

400
00:17:34,054 --> 00:17:35,389
BREAK IT UP!

401
00:17:35,472 --> 00:17:37,266
ALL RIGHT,
THIS COMPETITION'S OVER!

402
00:17:37,349 --> 00:17:40,018
I WANT EVERYONE TO LEAVE
AND GO HOME RIGHT NOW!

403
00:17:40,102 --> 00:17:41,270
EXCEPT FOR
THE DEGRASSI STUDENTS,

404
00:17:41,353 --> 00:17:44,398
WHO'RE GONNA WAIT IN THE GYM
UNTIL EVERYONE IS GONE!

405
00:17:44,481 --> 00:17:45,148
MOVE IT!

406
00:17:46,066 --> 00:17:46,400
NOW!

407
00:17:49,987 --> 00:17:51,154
SIMPSON:
YOU BOUGHT YOURSELF DETENTION
FOR A MONTH,

408
00:17:51,238 --> 00:17:52,447
AND I'M NOT SURE
THAT'S ALL!

409
00:17:52,531 --> 00:17:53,323
SO?

410
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:54,074
SO, I WANT YOU TO KNOW

411
00:17:54,157 --> 00:17:55,826
THAT I'M NOT EXACTLY
PROUD OF YOU RIGHT NOW.

412
00:17:55,909 --> 00:17:56,994
I'M SORRY.

413
00:17:57,077 --> 00:17:58,871
EMMA,
YOU RUINED A COMPETITION

414
00:17:58,954 --> 00:18:01,206
THAT MEANT A LOT
TO A LOT OF PEOPLE.

415
00:18:01,290 --> 00:18:02,875
AND I CARE?

416
00:18:02,958 --> 00:18:04,334
LAKEHURST KILLED JT!

417
00:18:04,418 --> 00:18:04,960
SIMPSON:
WRONG.

418
00:18:05,043 --> 00:18:07,171
ONE KID KILLED JT.

419
00:18:07,254 --> 00:18:08,297
YOU CAN'T BLAME
THE ENTIRE SCHOOL FOR THAT;

420
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:09,840
IT DOESN'T MAKE
ANY SENSE!

421
00:18:09,923 --> 00:18:11,592
I'M JUST MAD, OKAY?

422
00:18:11,675 --> 00:18:12,593
JT IS GONE,

423
00:18:12,676 --> 00:18:13,343
AND PEOPLE LIKE MANNY

424
00:18:13,427 --> 00:18:14,344
WANNA PRETEND
LIKE IT DIDN'T HAPPEN.

425
00:18:14,428 --> 00:18:16,138
BUT IT DID HAPPEN,

426
00:18:16,221 --> 00:18:17,931
AND I'M PISSED!

427
00:18:18,557 --> 00:18:20,851
WE ALL ARE,
OKAY?

428
00:18:20,934 --> 00:18:22,769
INCLUDING MANNY.

429
00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:24,688
BUT YOU CAN'T BLAME,
MANNY.

430
00:18:24,771 --> 00:18:26,940
SHE'S NOT THE ENEMY.

431
00:18:27,482 --> 00:18:28,525
EMMA,
SHE'S YOUR BEST FRIEND,

432
00:18:28,609 --> 00:18:30,402
AND MAYBE IT'S TIME
THAT YOU REMEMBER THAT.

433
00:18:37,117 --> 00:18:38,285
AS FAR AS SMELLS GO,

434
00:18:38,368 --> 00:18:41,872
THAT'S UH...
THAT'S JUST ABOVE ROADKILL.

435
00:18:42,873 --> 00:18:45,292
BUT I'M GOING
TO MISS IT.

436
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:46,835
I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE,
OKAY?

437
00:18:46,919 --> 00:18:47,628
NOT YET.

438
00:18:47,711 --> 00:18:50,589
I'M JUST...
I WAS JUST THINKING ABOUT IT.

439
00:18:50,672 --> 00:18:53,383
WELL, AS LONG AS YOU'RE
THINKING ABOUT IT,

440
00:18:53,467 --> 00:18:55,469
YOU JUST LET ME KNOW
WHEN YOU'VE DECIDED.

441
00:18:55,552 --> 00:18:57,179
SEE? THAT'S EXACLTY WHY
I DIDN'T TELL YOU.

442
00:18:57,262 --> 00:18:58,472
BECAUSE I KNEW
YOU'D FREAK OUT!

443
00:18:58,555 --> 00:19:00,015
HOW COULD I NOT,
DYLAN?!

444
00:19:00,098 --> 00:19:02,643
WHAT IS IT THAT YOU WANT ME
TO SAY RIGHT NOW?!

445
00:19:02,726 --> 00:19:06,104
MAYBE THAT YOU'RE
PROUD OF ME?!

446
00:19:06,188 --> 00:19:08,148
I AM PROUD OF YOU.

447
00:19:08,232 --> 00:19:08,941
YOU KNOW THAT.

448
00:19:09,024 --> 00:19:10,526
NO, I DON'T.

449
00:19:10,609 --> 00:19:12,027
YOU'VE NEVER TOLD ME.

450
00:19:12,110 --> 00:19:13,570
TO YOU,
HOCKEY'S MY DUMB HOBBY;

451
00:19:13,654 --> 00:19:15,572
TO ME, IT'S LIFE.

452
00:19:22,079 --> 00:19:23,080
DYLAN...

453
00:19:23,622 --> 00:19:27,125
IF THIS IS WHAT
YOU WANT TO DO THEN...

454
00:19:28,085 --> 00:19:30,045
YOU GOTTA DO IT.

455
00:19:31,588 --> 00:19:33,173
BUT I WANT TO BE WITH YOU.

456
00:19:43,851 --> 00:19:46,770
THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY
KNOCKING.

457
00:19:48,272 --> 00:19:49,940
FORGET KNOCKING,

458
00:19:50,023 --> 00:19:52,317
IT'S BREAKING
THE DOOR DOWN.

459
00:19:52,401 --> 00:19:54,736
YOU GOTTA DO IT,
OKAY?

460
00:19:58,657 --> 00:20:00,075
SO THEN UM...

461
00:20:01,618 --> 00:20:02,911
HOW LONG...

462
00:20:04,621 --> 00:20:06,123
TILL YOU GO?

463
00:20:06,915 --> 00:20:09,376
THERE'S WORK VISAS
AND STUFF TO FIGURE OUT.

464
00:20:09,459 --> 00:20:11,461
MAYBE A FEW WEEKS.

465
00:20:12,337 --> 00:20:13,672
WELL, THEN...

466
00:20:15,591 --> 00:20:18,969
WE BETTER MAKE
THE MOST OF IT, HUH?

467
00:20:29,771 --> 00:20:31,732
SO, GOT YOUR TEXT.

468
00:20:31,815 --> 00:20:33,984
WHAT DO YOU WANNA
SHOW ME?

469
00:20:34,067 --> 00:20:34,985
THIS.

470
00:20:35,819 --> 00:20:37,821
THIS CURB RIGHT HERE.

471
00:20:37,905 --> 00:20:39,406
THIS IS WHERE
IT HAPPENED.

472
00:20:39,489 --> 00:20:40,908
JT DIED HERE.

473
00:20:40,991 --> 00:20:43,410
EM, YOU DON'T HAVE
TO SHOW ME THIS.

474
00:20:43,493 --> 00:20:45,370
NO, I THINK I DO.

475
00:20:45,454 --> 00:20:47,372
BECAUSE THIS WHOLE THING
BETWEEN US,

476
00:20:47,456 --> 00:20:50,667
IT ISN'T ABOUT LAKEHURST
OR DAMIAN.

477
00:20:50,751 --> 00:20:54,922
IT'S ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED
RIGHT HERE TWO WEEKS AGO.

478
00:20:55,005 --> 00:20:56,089
I KNOW.

479
00:21:00,177 --> 00:21:01,178
MANNY...

480
00:21:01,678 --> 00:21:05,140
I'M REALLY, REALLY SORRY,
FOR EVERYTHING.

481
00:21:05,224 --> 00:21:07,309
I KNOW YOU ARE.

482
00:21:07,392 --> 00:21:10,437
BUT EMMA YOU TURNED ME
INTO THE BAD GUY.

483
00:21:10,521 --> 00:21:12,773
YOU TRIED TO HATE ME.

484
00:21:13,690 --> 00:21:15,943
WELL, IT DIDN'T WORK.

485
00:21:17,528 --> 00:21:21,573
ANYTHING WE'VE EVER GOTTEN
THROUGH HAS BEEN TOGETHER.

486
00:21:21,657 --> 00:21:25,327
DON'T GO AND CHANGE
THE FORMULA, OKAY?

487
00:21:26,078 --> 00:21:28,705
THANKS FOR THE REMINDER.
