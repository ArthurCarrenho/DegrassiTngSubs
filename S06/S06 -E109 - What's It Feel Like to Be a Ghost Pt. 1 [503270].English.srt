00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:30,829
JT:
I PROPOSE THAT DEGRASSI

356
00:14:30,913 --> 00:14:32,581
SHOULD HAVE AN ON-SITE
DAYCARE.

357
00:14:32,664 --> 00:14:33,707
BENEFITS WOULD BE PLENTIFUL

358
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:36,001
FOR BOTH STAFF AND STUDENTS
WITH CHILDREN-

359
00:14:36,084 --> 00:14:38,170
THAT'S PREPOSTEROUS.
NEXT?

360
00:14:38,253 --> 00:14:39,796
JU- WAIT A MINUTE!

361
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:41,298
I HAVEN'T EVEN
FINISHED MY PITCH.

362
00:14:41,381 --> 00:14:42,549
YOU DON'T HAVE TO.

363
00:14:42,633 --> 00:14:43,467
I ALREADY KNOW
IT IS FOOLISH

364
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:45,052
AND ILL-CONCEIVED.

365
00:14:45,886 --> 00:14:47,179
WHAT ABOUT BUILDING
CODES, JT?

366
00:14:47,262 --> 00:14:48,889
WHAT ABOUT ER...

367
00:14:48,972 --> 00:14:51,141
CHILD HEIGHT COUNTERS,

368
00:14:51,225 --> 00:14:53,143
FACILITIES,
A PLAYGROUND?

369
00:14:53,227 --> 00:14:54,728
COME ON...

370
00:14:54,811 --> 00:14:55,729
TOBY...

371
00:14:56,897 --> 00:14:58,065
HELP ME OUT.

372
00:14:58,148 --> 00:15:01,985
UM, MAYBE YOU SHOULD
LET HIM FINISH HIS PITCH.

373
00:15:03,529 --> 00:15:04,112
OR NOT.

374
00:15:05,113 --> 00:15:06,573
NEXT!
MOVING ON.

375
00:15:06,657 --> 00:15:07,574
WAIT!

376
00:15:09,076 --> 00:15:10,118
JUST HEAR ME OUT.

377
00:15:10,202 --> 00:15:12,204
OUR COMMUNITY CAN
BENEFIT FROM THIS.

378
00:15:12,287 --> 00:15:13,580
YOU MEAN YOUR
GIRLFRIEND CAN.

379
00:15:13,664 --> 00:15:14,540
JT:
YEAH, AND?

380
00:15:14,623 --> 00:15:16,917
LIBERTY:
AND SO THIS ISN'T
PRACTICAL FOR DEGRASSI,

381
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:17,960
ESPECIALLY SINCE
A DAYCARE

382
00:15:18,043 --> 00:15:19,586
WOULDN'T EVEN OPEN
FOR 2 YEARS!

383
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:22,005
LOOK THIS IS PERSONAL,
NOT SERIOUS.

384
00:15:22,089 --> 00:15:23,048
NEXT?

385
00:15:23,882 --> 00:15:25,342
IS THIS EARTH?

386
00:15:25,425 --> 00:15:26,635
YOU'RE THE ONE
MAKING IT PERSONAL.

387
00:15:26,718 --> 00:15:27,553
IT'S A GOOD IDEA!

388
00:15:27,636 --> 00:15:29,721
WE DON'T TAKE PITCHES
FROM IRRESPONSIBLE SLACKERS

389
00:15:29,805 --> 00:15:31,181
WITH ILL-RESEARCHED
SCHEMES!

390
00:15:31,265 --> 00:15:32,057
I GUESS NOT.

391
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:34,518
SINCE JUDGMENTAL ROBOTS
MAKE THE DECISIONS!

392
00:15:34,601 --> 00:15:35,727
A DEGRASSI DAYCARE

393
00:15:35,811 --> 00:15:37,479
COULD MAKE LIFE EASIER
FOR STUDENTS.

394
00:15:37,563 --> 00:15:39,356
FOR ONE STUDENT.

395
00:15:39,439 --> 00:15:43,318
LIBERTY, YOU OF ALL PEOPLE
KNOW I'M NOT ALONE.

396
00:15:43,402 --> 00:15:45,445
IT COULD HELP...
EVENTUALLY.

397
00:15:45,529 --> 00:15:46,780
JT:
SO JUST TO CLARIFY HERE,

398
00:15:46,864 --> 00:15:48,740
THE REASON YOU WON'T SUPPORT
A DEGRASSI DAYCARE

399
00:15:48,824 --> 00:15:50,909
IS PURELY SELFISH.

400
00:15:50,993 --> 00:15:53,871
IS THAT RIGHT,
MS. PRESIDENT?

401
00:15:58,375 --> 00:15:59,751
ELLIE:
YEAH, BUT IT WAS HIS CHOICE!

402
00:15:59,835 --> 00:16:00,794
(SATISFIED EATING SOUNDS)

403
00:16:00,878 --> 00:16:02,546
WELL, ROUSSEAU DID SAY,

404
00:16:02,629 --> 00:16:03,797
"MAN'S CHOICES
ARE LIMITED."

405
00:16:03,881 --> 00:16:05,215
YOU KNOW,
"MAN IS BORN FREE,

406
00:16:05,299 --> 00:16:06,800
BUT EVERYWHERE
IS IN CHAINS."

407
00:16:06,884 --> 00:16:08,969
ONLY TRUE
IF HE'S PART OF SOCIETY!

408
00:16:09,052 --> 00:16:09,303
HMM.

409
00:16:09,386 --> 00:16:10,137
CRAIG:
YEAH, BUT YOU CAN'T
NOT BE THOUGH!

410
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:11,597
IT'S NOT EXACTLY OPTIONAL.

411
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:13,223
(POLITE LAUGHTER)

412
00:16:13,307 --> 00:16:14,474
SO TRUE.

413
00:16:16,185 --> 00:16:18,562
MANNY,
YOU'VE STUDIED ROUSSEAU?

414
00:16:18,645 --> 00:16:20,480
UM... NOT EXACTLY.

415
00:16:22,149 --> 00:16:23,192
HE WAS UH...

416
00:16:23,275 --> 00:16:26,236
HE WAS A BIG
18TH CENTURY THINKER.

417
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,154
ELLIE SENT ME
ONE OF HIS BOOKS

418
00:16:27,237 --> 00:16:29,156
WHEN I WAS ON THE ROAD.

419
00:16:29,823 --> 00:16:30,908
UM, HOW NICE.

420
00:16:33,202 --> 00:16:36,079
MARCO:
WELL, ELLIE AND I HAVE BEEN
TAKING INTRO TO PYSCH?

421
00:16:36,163 --> 00:16:37,873
AND AH, JUNG SAYS

422
00:16:37,956 --> 00:16:40,459
THAT WE ALL HAVE LIKE,
MASSIVE COMPLEXES.

423
00:16:40,542 --> 00:16:42,377
HMM. NO KIDDING!
NEUROSIS RULES!

424
00:16:42,461 --> 00:16:45,172
(ALL GIVE FAKE CHEERS)
(LAUGHTER)

425
00:16:45,714 --> 00:16:47,758
MANNY,
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

426
00:16:47,841 --> 00:16:50,844
UM... SOMEONE TOLD ME
THAT WOODY ALLEN

427
00:16:52,054 --> 00:16:54,681
WAS A PERFECT ONSCREEN
NEUROTIC.

428
00:16:58,852 --> 00:16:59,478
UH HUH...

429
00:17:00,812 --> 00:17:04,066
WELL, I DON'T HAVE
ANY NEUROSES, OF COURSE.

430
00:17:04,149 --> 00:17:04,816
(LAUGHS)

431
00:17:05,859 --> 00:17:06,443
REALLY.

432
00:17:06,527 --> 00:17:08,529
BECAUSE I THOUGHT BEING
CONSTANTLY REJECTED BY GUYS

433
00:17:08,612 --> 00:17:10,697
WOULD MESS YOU UP,
ELLIE.

434
00:17:14,493 --> 00:17:16,245
YEAH.
(CHUCKLES)

435
00:17:16,328 --> 00:17:18,622
YEAH, I FEEL BAD THAT
I TAKE TIME TO MEET GUYS

436
00:17:18,705 --> 00:17:20,791
WHO ACTUALLY LIKE ME.

437
00:17:20,874 --> 00:17:21,458
OH, DEAR.

438
00:17:21,542 --> 00:17:22,501
ELLIE:
IN FACT,

439
00:17:22,584 --> 00:17:24,336
I DON'T KNOW HOW I MADE IT
THROUGH HIGH SCHOOL

440
00:17:24,419 --> 00:17:28,173
WITHOUT HAVING MY BREASTS
SHOWN ONLINE.

441
00:17:46,525 --> 00:17:47,276
WHERE ARE YOU
GOING?

442
00:17:47,359 --> 00:17:48,902
DID YOU HEAR
WHAT SHE SAID?

443
00:17:48,986 --> 00:17:51,154
YEAH,
BUT YOU STARTED IT.

444
00:17:51,238 --> 00:17:52,531
I MEAN, WHY CAN'T YOU
JUST GET OVER HER?

445
00:17:52,614 --> 00:17:53,699
BECAUSE-

446
00:17:53,782 --> 00:17:55,701
SHE'S SMARTER THAN ME,
SHE'S FUNNIER THAN ME,

447
00:17:55,784 --> 00:17:57,160
SHE'S EVERYTHING
THAT I'M NOT.

448
00:17:57,244 --> 00:17:58,245
KEEP BELIEVING IT,
MANNY.

449
00:17:58,328 --> 00:18:00,581
IT'S REAL ATTRACTIVE.

450
00:18:01,164 --> 00:18:03,375
THEY WON'T LET ME
INTO THEIR LITTLE CLUB.

451
00:18:03,458 --> 00:18:05,961
MANNY,
YOU'RE SPONTANEOUS.

452
00:18:06,044 --> 00:18:06,879
YOU'RE BRIGHT.

453
00:18:06,962 --> 00:18:07,754
AND YOU'RE MY GIRL.

454
00:18:07,838 --> 00:18:10,924
WHY CAN'T YOU
JUST BE YOURSELF?

455
00:18:12,593 --> 00:18:16,221
MAYBE I JUST
NEED A LITTLE BOOST.

456
00:18:16,305 --> 00:18:17,222
WHERE IS IT?

457
00:18:17,306 --> 00:18:20,058
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

458
00:18:20,934 --> 00:18:21,852
WHOA.

459
00:18:23,812 --> 00:18:24,980
SHOW ME.

460
00:18:27,316 --> 00:18:28,817
WHAT?
NO.

461
00:18:28,901 --> 00:18:29,860
WHY?

462
00:18:29,943 --> 00:18:30,736
'CAUSE THEN I CAN TALK

463
00:18:30,819 --> 00:18:32,863
WITH ALL YOUR
SMART FRIENDS.

464
00:18:32,946 --> 00:18:35,949
THESE ARE THE PEOPLE YOU
WANNA SPEND TIME WITH, RIGHT?

465
00:18:36,033 --> 00:18:37,242
COME ON...

466
00:18:37,326 --> 00:18:39,036
THIS IS YOUR CLUB.

467
00:18:39,119 --> 00:18:40,454
I WANT IN.

468
00:18:54,259 --> 00:18:55,928
MANNY:
ANYWAYS, IT DOESN'T REALLY
MATTER IF I GET THE PART

469
00:18:56,011 --> 00:18:58,764
BECAUSE IT ALL THAT
IS HOW I PRESENT MYSELF

470
00:18:58,847 --> 00:18:59,765
IN THE LONG TERM.

471
00:18:59,848 --> 00:19:01,892
THAT'S WHAT
MY AGENT SAYS.

472
00:19:01,975 --> 00:19:03,393
YEAH, YEAH, NO.

473
00:19:03,477 --> 00:19:05,687
I MEAN, YOU HAVE TO GET
THEM TO REMEMBER YOU.

474
00:19:05,771 --> 00:19:06,438
YEAH!

475
00:19:06,522 --> 00:19:08,857
BECAUSE WHO WANTS TO BE YET
ANOTHER DUMB BORING ACTRESS,

476
00:19:08,941 --> 00:19:10,651
RIGHT, ELLIE?
(CHUCKLES)

477
00:19:10,734 --> 00:19:12,778
ANYWAYS,
I TOLD HER JUST CAST ME

478
00:19:12,861 --> 00:19:14,988
AS THE FUNNY GIRL,
YOU KNOW.

479
00:19:15,072 --> 00:19:15,948
I SAID THAT TO HER.

480
00:19:16,031 --> 00:19:17,658
IT'S SMART, YOU HAVE
TO GET NOTICED, RIGHT?

481
00:19:17,741 --> 00:19:18,575
MANNY:
OH MY!

482
00:19:18,659 --> 00:19:19,785
(CRAIG LAUGHS NERVOUSLY)

483
00:19:19,868 --> 00:19:21,954
I LOVE YOU SO MUCH.

OH MY... (LAUGHS)

486
00:19:24,831 --> 00:19:26,708
OH MY GOSH!
GET IT... OH.

00:19:30,504 --> 00:19:32,214
YOU KNOW MANNY,
IT'S REALLY FINE. IT'S...

490
00:19:32,297 --> 00:19:33,465
I AM SO SORRY.

OH BABY!

00:19:44,726 --> 00:19:45,894
JT:
LIBERTY!

494
00:19:45,978 --> 00:19:47,396
WHAT THE HELL
WAS THAT YESTERDAY?

495
00:19:47,479 --> 00:19:48,814
YOU DISMISSED
EVERYTHING I SAID

496
00:19:48,897 --> 00:19:50,190
VERY PROFESSIONAL,

497
00:19:50,274 --> 00:19:52,109
AND THEN YOU BAILED.

498
00:19:52,192 --> 00:19:53,402
YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT
WORDS LIKE THAT MEAN,

499
00:19:53,485 --> 00:19:54,862
MAN-CHILD!

500
00:19:54,945 --> 00:19:57,489
WHAT WAS IRRESPONSIBLE?

501
00:19:57,573 --> 00:19:59,116
SUPPORTING YOU?

502
00:19:59,199 --> 00:20:00,826
BEGGING YOU TO GO
TO THE DOCTORS?

503
00:20:00,909 --> 00:20:02,327
BACKING YOU WHEN
YOU GAVE HIM UP

504
00:20:02,411 --> 00:20:04,496
EVEN THOUGH
HE WAS MY SON TOO?

505
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:05,998
YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE SAYING.

506
00:20:06,081 --> 00:20:08,709
WHAT I'M SAYING
IS THAT I'M HAPPY.

507
00:20:08,792 --> 00:20:11,170
AND THAT MAKES YOU BURN.

508
00:20:11,253 --> 00:20:12,087
WHY?

509
00:20:12,796 --> 00:20:13,672
YOU'RE RIDICULOUS.

510
00:20:13,755 --> 00:20:15,382
NO, I'M RIGHT.

511
00:20:15,465 --> 00:20:17,843
OKAY, I HAVE A RIGHT
TO BE HAPPY.

512
00:20:17,926 --> 00:20:20,596
SO STOP TRYING TO MAKE ME
AS MISERABLE AS YOU ARE.

513
00:20:32,107 --> 00:20:33,192

THAN YOU WERE LAST NIGHT.

516
00:20:39,198 --> 00:20:39,948

HOW THIS HAPPENED.

WHAT'S GOING ON?

IT WOULD GET BAD SO FAST.
