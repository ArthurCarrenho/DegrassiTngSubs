00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:42,940
AND THE WAY THE LIGHT
HITS YOUR CHEEK...

184
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:45,317
IT'S ALL BURNED
INTO MY MEMORY.

185
00:08:45,317 --> 00:08:47,069
THANK YOU.

186
00:08:47,069 --> 00:08:49,780
NO ASH,
THANK YOU.

187
00:08:50,155 --> 00:08:52,824
YOU'RE MY NUMBER ONE.

188
00:08:52,824 --> 00:08:54,826
BEFORE EVERYTHING,

189
00:08:56,161 --> 00:08:57,913
IT'S ALL YOU.

190
00:08:59,998 --> 00:09:03,919
YOU KNOW, I WAS HOPING
TO POSE FOR YOU SOMEDAY.

191
00:09:04,294 --> 00:09:05,087
BUT LIKE YOU SAID,

192
00:09:05,087 --> 00:09:07,506
GOOD THINGS COME
TO THOSE WHO WAIT.

193
00:09:07,506 --> 00:09:10,050
I THINK THAT WAIT
IS ABOUT TO END.

194
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:11,635
MY PARENTS ARE
GOING OUT LATER

195
00:09:11,635 --> 00:09:12,970
AND I WAS THINKING

196
00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:15,514
YOU COULD COME OVER
TONIGHT.

197
00:09:15,514 --> 00:09:16,098
ARE YOU SURE?

198
00:09:16,098 --> 00:09:17,182
I MEAN...

199
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:19,309
WHY NOW?

200
00:09:19,977 --> 00:09:22,521
LET'S JUST SAY I THINK
I'M FINALLY READY...

201
00:09:22,521 --> 00:09:23,856
AND ABLE.

202
00:09:27,109 --> 00:09:28,443
DARCY:
WHAT IS THE ONE TROPHY MISSING

203
00:09:28,443 --> 00:09:30,112
FROM THE DEGRASSI
WALL OF GLORY?

204
00:09:30,112 --> 00:09:31,822
MANNY:
METRO CHEERLEADING
COMPETITION!

205
00:09:31,822 --> 00:09:33,490
AND WITH YOU, ME,

206
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:34,700
AND OUR NEW
SECRET WEAPON,

207
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:36,118
I THINK WE'RE READY
TO TAKE THIS SQUAD

208
00:09:36,118 --> 00:09:38,370
TO A WHOLE NEW LEVEL.

209
00:09:41,498 --> 00:09:43,709
HEY GUYS, THIS IS MY DAUGHTER,
ISABELLA.

210
00:09:43,709 --> 00:09:46,128
ISABELLA,
MEET MANNY AND DARCY.

211
00:09:46,128 --> 00:09:48,797
MANNY:
OH MY GOD! SHE'S ADORABLE!

212
00:09:48,797 --> 00:09:50,799
THAT'S YOUR BABY?

213
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:52,509
MANNY:
SIT. SIT. SIT. SIT. SIT.

214
00:09:52,509 --> 00:09:53,802
SPIRIT SQUAD,
SHMIRIT SQUAD.

215
00:09:53,802 --> 00:09:55,637
I HAVE TO HEAR ALL ABOUT
THIS LITTLE ANGEL.

216
00:09:57,139 --> 00:09:58,390
HI.
MY NAME'S MANNY.

217
00:10:00,934 --> 00:10:03,437
AND YOU ARE JUST SO CUTE.

218
00:10:14,156 --> 00:10:14,489
WHAT?

219
00:10:15,699 --> 00:10:16,116
WOW!

220
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:18,827
YOU LOOK...

221
00:10:20,787 --> 00:10:21,163
WOW.

222
00:10:35,677 --> 00:10:36,929
EVERYTHING OKAY?

223
00:10:36,929 --> 00:10:38,180
YEAH, YEAH.

224
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:40,432
I'M FINE.
DON'T STOP.

225
00:10:43,018 --> 00:10:44,603
YOU KNOW WHAT?

226
00:10:45,479 --> 00:10:47,773
THERE'S NOTHING
YOU CAN DO.

227
00:10:47,773 --> 00:10:50,192
YOU SHOULD PROBABLY
JUST GO.

228
00:11:09,253 --> 00:11:10,838
JIMMY:
ASHLEY...

229
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:15,551
ASH, I'M SORRY ABOUT
WHAT HAPPENED LAST NIGHT.

230
00:11:15,551 --> 00:11:18,178
OR IN MY CASE,
WHAT DIDN'T HAPPEN.

231
00:11:18,178 --> 00:11:19,930
YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU SHOULD APOLOGIZE.

232
00:11:19,930 --> 00:11:21,139
BUT NOT FOR THAT.

233
00:11:21,139 --> 00:11:23,475
JIMMY, WHEN A GIRL THROWS
HERSELF AT YOU?

234
00:11:23,475 --> 00:11:25,561
YOU DON'T KICK HER OUT.

235
00:11:25,561 --> 00:11:27,145
I'M SORRY.

236
00:11:27,145 --> 00:11:29,273
I JUST...
I COULDN'T DEAL.

237
00:11:29,273 --> 00:11:30,649
LOOK, SO IT WAS
A BAD IDEA.

238
00:11:30,649 --> 00:11:31,984
JIMMY,
IT DOESN'T MATTER.

239
00:11:31,984 --> 00:11:34,027
WE CAN TOTALLY LIVE
WITHOUT EVER...

240
00:11:34,027 --> 00:11:36,071
YOU KNOW.

241
00:11:36,071 --> 00:11:36,572
OKAY.

242
00:11:37,656 --> 00:11:41,952
WE CANNOT LIVE
WITHOUT "YOU KNOW."

243
00:11:41,952 --> 00:11:44,580
I'M GOING TO MAKE
THIS WORK.

244
00:11:48,792 --> 00:11:51,253
THERE ARE METHODS.

245
00:11:51,253 --> 00:11:52,754
I'VE DONE RESEARCH.

246
00:11:52,754 --> 00:11:54,339
THERE'RE MEDICAL OPTIONS.

247
00:11:54,339 --> 00:11:55,716
I KNOW.

248
00:11:55,716 --> 00:11:59,928
THAT'S WHY I'VE MADE
A DOCTOR'S APPOINTMENT.

249
00:12:03,473 --> 00:12:04,391
5, 6, 7, 8!

250
00:12:06,101 --> 00:12:07,686
HEY! ARE YOU READY?!

251
00:12:08,896 --> 00:12:11,523
ARE YOU READY
TO SHOUT IT OUT!

252
00:12:11,899 --> 00:12:13,609
BLUE AND GOLD!

253
00:12:14,943 --> 00:12:16,737
WE ARE DEGRASSI!

254
00:12:18,614 --> 00:12:20,073
THAT WAS GREAT.

255
00:12:20,073 --> 00:12:21,909
YOU'RE NOT MAKING
THIS DECISION EASY.

256
00:12:21,909 --> 00:12:24,244
UH, MIA? UP FRONT.

257
00:12:28,624 --> 00:12:29,750
DROP THE POMS.

258
00:12:32,377 --> 00:12:34,796
LET'S SEE
A HEAL STRETCH.

259
00:12:34,796 --> 00:12:35,297
SURE.

260
00:12:38,634 --> 00:12:41,512
HOW ABOUT
A BACK WALK OVER?

261
00:12:45,974 --> 00:12:47,893
DARCY:
TOE TOUCH?

262
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:52,231
NEEDS WORK.

263
00:12:54,650 --> 00:12:57,319
AND WOULD IT
KILL YOU TO SMILE?

264
00:12:57,319 --> 00:12:59,071
WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM?

265
00:12:59,071 --> 00:13:00,656
SHE'S OUR GIRL,
DARCY.

266
00:13:00,656 --> 00:13:01,657
FINE.

267
00:13:02,991 --> 00:13:03,909
GO BACK TO YOUR CHEERS.

268
00:13:06,662 --> 00:13:09,122
MANNY:
OKAY! WE'RE GOING TO TRY
SOMETHING A LITTLE DIFFERENT...

269
00:13:11,542 --> 00:13:14,670
JIMMY:
I WAS INTO IT.
SHE WAS INTO IT.

270
00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:15,671
WE WERE IN THE MOMENT

271
00:13:15,671 --> 00:13:17,673
AND UH...NOTHING.

272
00:13:18,674 --> 00:13:19,842
ANY OTHER TIME
YOU HAD AN ERECTION?

273
00:13:19,842 --> 00:13:21,510
WERE YOU IN
THE MOMENT THEN?

274
00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:23,178
I'M NOT ATTRACTED
TO MY PHYSIOTHERAPIST.

275
00:13:23,178 --> 00:13:24,888
IT JUST...
JUST HAPPENED.

276
00:13:24,888 --> 00:13:26,682
I UNDERSTAND.

277
00:13:26,682 --> 00:13:28,684
JIMMY, IT'S GOOD THAT
YOU HAD SOME ACTIVITY.

278
00:13:28,684 --> 00:13:31,186
IT JUST SEEMS
A LITTLE INVOLUNTARY.

279
00:13:31,186 --> 00:13:33,689
YOU KNOW, NOT THERE
WHEN YOU NEED IT,

280
00:13:33,689 --> 00:13:36,316
THERE WHEN YOU DON'T.

281
00:13:36,316 --> 00:13:37,609
LIKE WAITING FOR A BUS.

282
00:13:37,609 --> 00:13:38,527
YEAH. YEAH.

283
00:13:39,570 --> 00:13:42,948
LOOK, THERE ARE OPTIONS
FOR ERECTILE DYSFUNCTION:

284
00:13:42,948 --> 00:13:44,366
IMPLANTS, PUMPS.

285
00:13:44,992 --> 00:13:45,534
JIMMY:
IS THAT-

286
00:13:45,534 --> 00:13:47,160
IS THAT ALL THERE IS
THOUGH?

287
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:48,954
I HAVE TO TURN INTO
SOME SEX ROBOT,

288
00:13:48,954 --> 00:13:50,539
WIND ME UP
AND WATCH ME GO?

289
00:13:50,539 --> 00:13:53,709
WELL, IMPLANTS AND PUMPS,
THOSE ARE DOWN THE ROAD.

290
00:13:53,709 --> 00:13:54,626
FIRST THINGS FIRST,

291
00:13:54,626 --> 00:13:56,295
WE'RE GONNA GET YOU
ON SOME MEDICATION.

292
00:13:57,713 --> 00:13:59,715
AS IN THE PILL THAT GETS
THE MIDDLE-AGED PEOPLE

293
00:13:59,715 --> 00:14:01,383
DANCING IN THE STREETS?

294
00:14:01,383 --> 00:14:05,053
WELL, IT CAN BE EFFECTIVE
IN SOME CASES, YEAH.

295
00:14:08,182 --> 00:14:10,726
WHAT IF IT'S NOT,
THOUGH?

296
00:14:11,727 --> 00:14:12,895
I MEAN, I...

297
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:18,609
I JUST DON'T WANT TO BE
A VIRGIN

298
00:14:18,609 --> 00:14:20,986
FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE.

299
00:14:22,613 --> 00:14:24,698
DON'T BROADCAST IT.

300
00:14:25,574 --> 00:14:27,659
LOOK,
IF THIS DOESN'T WORK?

301
00:14:27,659 --> 00:14:29,912
WE EXPLORE THE OTHER OPTIONS.

302
00:14:31,872 --> 00:14:34,499
YOU TAKE ONE,
GIVE IT AN HOUR.

303
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:37,878
AND REMEMBER TO RELAX,
OKAY?

304
00:14:44,801 --> 00:14:46,720
SHOULD I PUT
SOME MUSIC ON?

305
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,805
NO, I LIKE THE QUIET.

306
00:14:51,183 --> 00:14:53,185
LET'S SEE HERE.

307
00:14:53,977 --> 00:14:57,397
SAYS SIDE EFFECTS MAY INCLUDE
INCREASED TENSION,

308
00:14:57,397 --> 00:14:58,774
MUSCLE SPASMS,

309
00:14:58,774 --> 00:15:01,360
UPSET STOMACH,
DIARRHEA.

310
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,779
GREAT.
NOW I'M IN THE MOOD.

311
00:15:03,779 --> 00:15:04,947
(THEY CHUCKLE)

312
00:15:04,947 --> 00:15:06,657
WELL, IT SAYS IT COULD TAKE
OVER AN HOUR.

313
00:15:06,657 --> 00:15:08,325
IT'S BEEN ALMOST TWO.

314
00:15:08,825 --> 00:15:10,619
WELL, DID YOU HAVE
A BIG LUNCH OR ANYTHING?

315
00:15:10,619 --> 00:15:12,621
NO, I'M STARVING MYSELF.

316
00:15:14,164 --> 00:15:15,165
I JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE
THIS'D WORK.

317
00:15:17,125 --> 00:15:19,628
MAYBE YOU JUST NEED TO RELAX.

318
00:15:26,885 --> 00:15:28,804
SEE, ISN'T THAT NICE?

319
00:15:29,555 --> 00:15:30,556
JIMMY:
YEAH.

320
00:15:40,315 --> 00:15:41,817
(TURNS TV ON)

321
00:15:41,817 --> 00:15:43,485
ASHLEY:
WHAT'S WRONG?

322
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:46,280
JIMMY:
JUST FORGET IT.

323
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:47,197
STRIKE TWO.

324
00:15:55,914 --> 00:15:57,165
MS. HATZILAKOS: (OVER P.A.)
LISTEN UP, DEGRASSI.

325
00:15:57,165 --> 00:15:59,084
TONIGHT, THE JUNIOR GIRLS
BASKETBALL TEAM

326
00:15:59,084 --> 00:16:00,502
PLAYS THEIR FIRST GAME...

327
00:16:00,502 --> 00:16:01,628
I SAY FORGET
ABOUT CHEERS.

328
00:16:01,628 --> 00:16:03,422
IF WE WANNA WIN
THE METRO COMPETITION,

329
00:16:03,422 --> 00:16:04,923
IT NEEDS TO BE MORE
ABOUT DANCE,

330
00:16:04,923 --> 00:16:07,217
GYMNASTICS, STUNTS,
PYRAMIDS...

331
00:16:07,217 --> 00:16:09,720
YEAH, THAT'S ASSUMING
I'M EVEN ON THE SQUAD.

332
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:11,471
CAPTAIN DARCY'S BEEN GIVING ME
THE FREEZIE-CHILLS.

333
00:16:11,471 --> 00:16:12,681
SHE'S A BIT UPTIGHT,

334
00:16:12,681 --> 00:16:16,059
BUT SHE WANTS TO WIN
AS BAD AS I DO.

335
00:16:19,438 --> 00:16:20,856
(EXCITED CHATTER)

336
00:16:22,441 --> 00:16:24,026
NO. NO!
DARCY!

337
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:27,029
SOMEONE'S MISSING
FROM THIS LIST!

338
00:16:27,029 --> 00:16:28,447
EVERYONE WHO DESERVES
TO BE ON THE TEAM

339
00:16:28,447 --> 00:16:28,864
IS THERE.

340
00:16:28,864 --> 00:16:29,823
YEAH, RIGHT.

341
00:16:29,823 --> 00:16:30,866
NOBODY DESERVES
TO BE ON THE SQUAD

342
00:16:30,866 --> 00:16:32,201
MORE THAN MIA DOES.

343
00:16:32,201 --> 00:16:35,704
SORRY, MANNY.
MY DECISION'S FINAL.

344
00:16:39,041 --> 00:16:47,883
♪♪♪

345
00:16:48,759 --> 00:16:50,010
YOU'RE GOING DOWN,
DEGRASSI!

346
00:16:57,893 --> 00:16:59,770
WHOA! THEY'RE BIG.

347
00:17:00,521 --> 00:17:01,897
SIZE ISN'T EVERYTHING,
JT.

348
00:17:09,112 --> 00:17:10,280
DARCY:
WHAT IS THIS?

349
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:11,740
MANNY:
YOU CAN'T KEEP HER
OFF THE TEAM.

350
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:13,075
YOU KNOW
I DESERVE THIS.

351
00:17:13,075 --> 00:17:15,536
OR IS THERE SOME SORT OF
NO-SINGLE-MOMS POLICY?

352
00:17:15,536 --> 00:17:17,996
MIA, YOUR BABY IS
A HUGE RESPONSIBILITY,

353
00:17:17,996 --> 00:17:19,915
AND, WELL,
SO IS SPIRIT SQUAD.

354
00:17:19,915 --> 00:17:20,874
I'M SORRY.

355
00:17:21,917 --> 00:17:23,669
MANNY:
WHEN MY NEW MANICURE
MEETS YOUR FACE?

356
00:17:23,669 --> 00:17:24,670
THEN YOU'LL BE SORRY.

357
00:17:24,670 --> 00:17:26,505
MIA:
DARCY, ISABELLA HAS DAYCARE.

358
00:17:26,505 --> 00:17:28,674
SHE CAN BE TAKEN CARE OF
WHENEVER I'M AT PRACTICE.

359

I CAN DO BOTH.

360
00:17:29,925 --> 00:17:31,134
HOW CAN I BELIEVE SOMEONE

361
00:17:31,134 --> 00:17:33,554
WHO'S MADE SUCH ENORMOUS
LIFE MISTAKES?

362
00:17:33,554 --> 00:17:34,346
MISTAKES?!

363
00:17:34,346 --> 00:17:35,931
UNLESS YOU GOT KNOCKED UP
ON PURPOSE.

364
00:17:35,931 --> 00:17:37,891

YOU'VE GOT EVEN BIGGER ISSUES.

JT:
WHAT CAN I SAY?

381
00:18:25,772 --> 00:18:27,065
WHEN MY SCHOOL NEEDED ME,
I POUNCED.

YEAH, WELL, THAT'S GREAT.

384
00:18:31,236 --> 00:18:32,696

THIS ISN'T OVER.

388
00:18:41,997 --> 00:18:44,666
DETENTION NEVER
SOUNDED SO GOOD.

389
00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:49,379
FORFEITING -
NOT THE SAME AS LOSING.

390
00:18:49,379 --> 00:18:51,173
SURE.
WHATEVER.

391
00:18:51,173 --> 00:18:52,007
YOU GOING HOME?

392
00:18:52,007 --> 00:18:54,468
BECAUSE WE STILL HAVE THAT
MEDIA EMERSION ASSIGNMENT.

393
00:18:54,468 --> 00:18:57,221
WE COULD JUST HANG OUT,
DO SOME HOMEWORK.

394
00:18:57,221 --> 00:18:58,180
NO LINGERIE.

395
00:18:58,180 --> 00:18:59,973

NO PRESSURE.

YOU KNOW WHAT?

397
00:19:00,599 --> 00:19:04,853
COME OVER TONIGHT
AND GET YOUR STUFF.

398
00:19:04,853 --> 00:19:06,021
I CAN'T DO THIS.

399
00:19:19,159 --> 00:19:20,953
MIA'S IN WITH MS. H.
GETTING LECTURED.

400
00:19:20,953 --> 00:19:21,954
I HOPE YOU'RE HAPPY.

401
00:19:21,954 --> 00:19:23,163
SHE'S A TEENAGE MOTHER,
MANNY,

402
00:19:23,163 --> 00:19:24,540
WITH A VIOLENT STREAK.

403
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:26,917
AND SOMEHOW YOU HAVE
THE RIGHT TO PUNISH HER?

404
00:19:26,917 --> 00:19:29,545
SHE HAS BETTER THINGS TO DO
THAN WAVE POM-POMS.

405
00:19:29,545 --> 00:19:31,547
AND YOU'RE JUST SO CONCERNED
FOR HER DAUGHTER.

406
00:19:31,547 --> 00:19:32,881
SPARE ME.

407
00:19:36,552 --> 00:19:37,678
I'M OFF THE SQUAD.

408
00:19:37,678 --> 00:19:38,679
PROBLEM SOLVED.

409
00:19:38,679 --> 00:19:41,181
WELL, THEN I QUIT.

410
00:19:41,181 --> 00:19:42,683
AND LET MEAN GIRL
TAKE OVER?

411
00:19:42,683 --> 00:19:43,892
DON'T BE STUPID.

412
00:19:43,892 --> 00:19:45,561
THEY NEED YOU.

413
00:19:54,570 --> 00:19:55,821
THIS IS YOURS.

414
00:19:55,821 --> 00:19:56,572
JIMMY:
YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU CAN KEEP IT.

415
00:19:56,572 --> 00:19:58,115
I DON'T WANT IT.

416
00:19:58,115 --> 00:19:59,491
ASHLEY:
I THOUGHT YOU WANTED
TO BREAK UP.

417
00:19:59,491 --> 00:20:01,285
JIMMY:
I DON'T.

418
00:20:01,785 --> 00:20:03,036
WE JUST MAY AS WELL
DO IT NOW.

419
00:20:03,036 --> 00:20:04,580
IT'S GONNA HAPPEN
EVENTUALLY.

420
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:05,664
WHY WOULD YOU SAY THAT?

421
00:20:05,664 --> 00:20:06,665
WHAT?
DID YOU GET YOUR PALM READ?

422
00:20:06,665 --> 00:20:08,500
TAROT CARDS?

423
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:08,750
LOOK...

424
00:20:09,585 --> 00:20:10,419
IF I CAN'T DO THIS,

425
00:20:10,419 --> 00:20:12,296
HOW LONG ARE YOU REALLY
GONNA STICK AROUND?

426
00:20:12,296 --> 00:20:13,881
SIX MONTHS?
A YEAR?

427
00:20:13,881 --> 00:20:16,175
WHY DO GUYS ONLY THINK
ABOUT ONE THING?

428
00:20:16,175 --> 00:20:17,926
I'M THINKING ABOUT
A LOT OF THINGS.

429
00:20:17,926 --> 00:20:19,803
WHAT IF I CAN'T,
EVER?

430
00:20:19,803 --> 00:20:21,638
THEN WE DEAL WITH IT.
WHO CARES?

431
00:20:21,638 --> 00:20:23,557
I CARE, ASHLEY!

432
00:20:24,224 --> 00:20:27,019
I'M A VIRGIN.
DO YOU GET IT?

433
00:20:27,019 --> 00:20:28,437
DO YOU KNOW WHAT
IT FEELS LIKE

434
00:20:28,437 --> 00:20:29,980
TO KNOW THAT YOUR EPITAPH
IS GONNA READ

435
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:31,607
"JIMMY BROOKS:
CRIPPLED VIRGIN."

436
00:20:35,611 --> 00:20:36,612
I MEAN...

437
00:20:36,612 --> 00:20:38,238
I CAN'T WALK.

438
00:20:38,238 --> 00:20:39,448
I CAN'T RUN.

439
00:20:39,448 --> 00:20:40,157
I CAN'T DANCE.

440
00:20:40,157 --> 00:20:43,118
I CAN'T PLAY BASKETBALL.

441
00:20:43,118 --> 00:20:44,786
I CAN'T EVEN...

442
00:20:46,955 --> 00:20:48,624
I CAN'T EVEN
MAKE LOVE TO YOU.

443
00:20:51,126 --> 00:20:52,628
BUT YOU CAN, JIMMY.

444
00:20:52,628 --> 00:20:53,212
YOU CAN.

445
00:20:53,212 --> 00:20:54,546
NO, I CAN'T.

446
00:20:54,546 --> 00:20:55,672
SAYS WHO?

447
00:20:55,672 --> 00:20:57,883
WHO SAYS SEX HAS TO BE
JUST ONE THING.

448
00:20:57,883 --> 00:20:59,426
JIMMY...

449
00:20:59,426 --> 00:21:01,637
THERE'RE A LOT OF WAYS
TO MAKE LOVE.

450
00:21:01,637 --> 00:21:03,388
I KNOW, ASH.

451
00:21:03,931 --> 00:21:04,848
I KNOW.

452
00:21:04,848 --> 00:21:05,641
BUT...

453
00:21:06,642 --> 00:21:09,394
THIS ISN'T JUST
ABOUT SEX.

454
00:21:10,437 --> 00:21:11,647
THIS IS ABOUT WHETHER
I CAN DO

455
00:21:11,647 --> 00:21:13,899
ALL THE THINGS
THAT I WANNA DO.

456
00:21:17,027 --> 00:21:18,278
THIS IS ABOUT WHETHER
I CAN BE

457
00:21:18,278 --> 00:21:19,738
THE MAN THAT I WANNA BE.

458
00:21:24,826 --> 00:21:27,287
YOU'RE THE MAN THAT
I WANT YOU TO BE, JIMMY.

459
00:21:27,287 --> 00:21:29,289
ISN'T THAT ENOUGH?

460
00:21:32,376 --> 00:21:33,377
YEAH.
