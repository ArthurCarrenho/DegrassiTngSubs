LOCKER RENOVATION
TIME?

3
00:00:08,842 --> 00:00:10,677
TIMES CHANGE,
THINGS GET OUTDATED.

4
00:00:10,761 --> 00:00:13,013
LIKE HAIRSTYLES,
OUTFITS,

5
00:00:13,096 --> 00:00:14,640
AND STUPID COKEHEAD
BOYFRIENDS.

6
00:00:15,182 --> 00:00:15,974
JT:
HEY.

7
00:00:16,058 --> 00:00:18,352
I HEARD ABOUT YOU
AND CRAIG.

8
00:00:18,435 --> 00:00:19,520
SORRY.

9
00:00:19,603 --> 00:00:20,812
DON'T BE.

10
00:00:20,896 --> 00:00:22,731
I DUMPED HIM
AND I COULDN'T BE HAPPIER.

11
00:00:23,232 --> 00:00:25,025
HAPPY, HAPPY, HAPPY!

12
00:00:25,108 --> 00:00:26,276
THIS IS HAPPY?

13
00:00:27,069 --> 00:00:27,903
MANNY:
(IRRITATED EXHALE)

14
00:00:27,986 --> 00:00:30,614
I GUESS I AM
A LITTLE CUCKOO-BANANAS.

15
00:00:30,697 --> 00:00:33,075
WHICH IS TOTALLY NORMAL
RIGHT NOW.

16
00:00:33,158 --> 00:00:35,452
DR. EM'S PRESCRIPTION
IS TO CHILL.

17
00:00:35,536 --> 00:00:36,620
AND AS OF THIS AFT,

18
00:00:36,703 --> 00:00:38,872
THE HOUSE IS OURS
THE ENTIRE WEEKEND!

19
00:00:38,956 --> 00:00:40,999
WE CAN DO WHATEVER.

20
00:00:42,084 --> 00:00:44,002
WE SHOULD HAVE A PARTY!

21
00:00:44,545 --> 00:00:45,879
OR WE COULD...
RENT A DVD,

22
00:00:45,963 --> 00:00:48,841
JUST YOU, ME AND SEAN,
COZY AND QUIET.

23
00:00:48,924 --> 00:00:50,843
OR WE COULD HAVE
A PARTY!

24
00:00:50,926 --> 00:00:51,885
OKAY, LET'S JUST SAY

25
00:00:51,969 --> 00:00:54,054
WE GO AGAINST MY MOM'S
SPECIFIC ORDERS

26
00:00:54,137 --> 00:00:56,306
NOT TO HAVE A PARTY.

27
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:59,017
WE DON'T HAVE A REASON
OR AN OCCASION TO CELEBRATE...

28
00:00:59,101 --> 00:00:59,810
AT ALL.

29
00:00:59,893 --> 00:01:00,727
JT:
YOU KNOW WHAT?

30
00:01:00,811 --> 00:01:02,938
IT IS LIBERTY'S BIRTHDAY.

31
00:01:03,021 --> 00:01:05,065
SHE COULD REALLY USE
SOME CHEERING UP.

32
00:01:05,148 --> 00:01:07,401
AND AS HER OLDEST FRIENDS,

33
00:01:07,484 --> 00:01:08,902
THAT'S OUR SOLEMN DUTY,
ISN'T IT?

34
00:01:08,986 --> 00:01:10,070
WE JUST HAVE
TO HAVE A PARTY!

35
00:01:10,153 --> 00:01:12,239
THANKS, JT.
YOU ARE SO THOUGHTFUL!

36
00:01:12,322 --> 00:01:13,323
JT:
WELL, THAT'S ME.

37
00:01:13,407 --> 00:01:14,658
MR. THOUGHTFUL.

LIBERTY!

JUST THE PERSON
I WANTED TO TALK TO.

44
00:02:17,387 --> 00:02:19,097
UM, WHAT YOU'RE UP TO?

45
00:02:19,181 --> 00:02:20,390
OH, JUST SENDING
A REMINDER EMAIL

46
00:02:20,474 --> 00:02:22,267
FOR THE "INCREASE THE PEACE"
SUMMIT.

47
00:02:22,351 --> 00:02:23,477
I MEANT TONIGHT.

00:02:28,106 --> 00:02:29,399
EXCUSE ME?

52
00:02:29,483 --> 00:02:31,443
I'M HOLDING A BIRTHDAY PARTY
FOR YOU, LIB,

53
00:02:31,527 --> 00:02:34,154
MY OLDEST, DEAREST FRIEND
IN THE ENTIRE SCHOOL.

54
00:02:34,238 --> 00:02:35,739
WE'VE BARELY TALKED
ALL YEAR.

55
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:36,782
MANNY:
WE'LL FIX THAT TONIGHT.

56
00:02:36,865 --> 00:02:39,576
MUCHO CONVO WHILE WE PARTY
OUR BRAINS OUT!

57
00:02:41,328 --> 00:02:42,829
(GROANS) I DON'T HAVE
A THING TO WEAR,

58
00:02:42,913 --> 00:02:44,164
AND MY HAIR'S A MESS.

59
00:02:44,248 --> 00:02:45,624
WHO ARE YOU
TALKING TO HERE?

60
00:02:45,707 --> 00:02:47,251
COME OVER EARLY,
I'LL HOT YOU UP.

61
00:02:49,586 --> 00:02:52,172
WELL, I SUPPOSE THIS
STUDENT COUNCIL PRESIDENT

62
00:02:52,256 --> 00:02:54,466
COULD USE
A LITTLE ROMANCE.

63
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:55,342
THAT'S THE SPIRIT!

64
00:02:55,425 --> 00:02:57,845
WE ARE GONNA PARTY TONIGHT,
GIRLFRIEND!

65
00:02:57,928 --> 00:03:00,514
PARTY WE WILL,
GIRLFRIEND.

66
00:03:00,597 --> 00:03:02,015
BUT IT COMES
AT A PRICE.

67
00:03:02,099 --> 00:03:04,893
COME TO MY PEACE SUMMIT
WITH LAKEHURST, AT LUNCH.

68
00:03:04,977 --> 00:03:06,395
ME? WHY ME?

69
00:03:06,937 --> 00:03:08,522
EXPERIENCE SHOWS
THAT MANNY SANTOS

70
00:03:08,605 --> 00:03:10,858
DOUBLES THE MALE
ATTENDANCE.

71
00:03:10,941 --> 00:03:12,943
WHATEVER. I JUST HOPE
SOMEONE CUTE IS COMING

72
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:15,070
BECAUSE YOU NEED
A DATE FOR TONIGHT.

73
00:03:15,153 --> 00:03:16,989
MM.
LET US PRAY.

74
00:03:20,117 --> 00:03:20,951
DAMIAN:
HI, I'M DAMIAN.

75
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:22,578
I'M LAKEHURST'S
STUDENT COUNCIL PRESIDENT.

76
00:03:22,661 --> 00:03:24,204
THIS IS OUR VP, NORA.

77
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:25,664
HEY GUYS,
NICE TO BE HERE.

78
00:03:26,832 --> 00:03:28,792
SOMEONE'S PRAYERS
WERE ANSWERED.

79
00:03:28,876 --> 00:03:30,210
DAMIAN:
SO, WE'RE HERE TODAY
TO FIGURE OUT

80
00:03:30,294 --> 00:03:31,837
HOW TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM
OF VIOLENCE

81
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,297
BETWEEN OUR SCHOOLS.

82
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:34,715
WHAT DO WE DO?

83
00:03:34,798 --> 00:03:36,091
DANNY:
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT
THE PROBLEM IS:

84
00:03:36,175 --> 00:03:38,135
YOUR SCHOOL IS FULL
OF PSYCHOS!

85
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:39,469
(QUIET CHATTER)

86
00:03:40,888 --> 00:03:42,556
PEOPLE, IF PEACE IS
TO BE ACHIEVED,

87
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:44,016
WE NEED TO GET
TOGETHER.

88
00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:45,392
ANY IDEAS?

89
00:03:45,475 --> 00:03:47,227
HOW ABOUT A SPIRIT SQUAD RALLY?

90
00:03:48,896 --> 00:03:50,564
TOBY:
UH, HOW DOES CHEERING

91
00:03:50,647 --> 00:03:52,983
PREVENT MY OTHER ARM
FROM GETTING SPRAINED?

92
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:54,985
OKAY.
WELL, WE CAN FOLLOW IT

93
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:56,445
WITH AN "INCREASE THE PEACE"
DANCE?

94
00:03:56,528 --> 00:03:58,697
KIND OF LIKE THE U.N.,
EXCEPT WITH HUMAN PYRAMIDS

95
00:03:58,780 --> 00:03:59,781
AND DANCING?

96
00:04:00,866 --> 00:04:03,076
SOLD.
SOUNDS LIKE FUN.

97
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:04,161
ALL IN FAVOUR?

98
00:04:05,495 --> 00:04:06,747
EXCELLENT!
WE'LL TAKE MANNY'S IDEA

99
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:07,623
TO OUR PRINCIPALS.

100
00:04:07,706 --> 00:04:09,708

101
00:04:12,377 --> 00:04:14,546

KOFI ANNAN.

102
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:17,132

AND A DIPLOMAT;

104

BRAINS AND BEAUTY.

105
00:04:21,595 --> 00:04:23,764
SPEAKING OF BRAINS
AND BEAUTY,

106
00:04:23,847 --> 00:04:24,765
IT'S LIBERTY'S BIRTHDAY.

107
00:04:24,848 --> 00:04:26,475
BIG BASH TONIGHT!

108
00:04:26,558 --> 00:04:27,976
CLOSE FRIENDS,
FELLOW PEACENIKS.

109
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:30,854
GOTTA "INCREASE
THE PEACE", RIGHT?

110
00:04:30,938 --> 00:04:32,105
RIGHT.
COUNT ME IN.

111
00:04:32,189 --> 00:04:34,233
UNTIL THEN,
HAVE A GOOD ONE, LIBERTY.

112
00:04:34,316 --> 00:04:36,652
I'LL DO MY DARNEDNEST!

113
00:04:40,697 --> 00:04:42,032
LIBERTY.

114
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:43,116
HEY!

115
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:46,036
YOU MISSED
THE PEACE SUMMIT.

116
00:04:47,538 --> 00:04:49,373
I'M STAYING OUT OF IT.

117
00:04:49,456 --> 00:04:50,999
I'VE CAUSED
ENOUGH PROBLEMS.

118
00:04:51,083 --> 00:04:52,751
I JUST WANTED TO
CONGRATULATE YOU.

119
00:04:52,835 --> 00:04:55,629
YOUR B.B.P.E.
IS WELL DESERVED.

120
00:04:55,712 --> 00:04:56,797
TRANSLATION?

121
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,800
BIG BIRTHDAY PARTY
EXTRAVAGANZA.

122
00:04:59,883 --> 00:05:01,176
YEAH, I APPRECIATE
MANNY'S EFFORT,

123
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:03,971
BUT YOU KNOW HOW I FEEL
ABOUT BIRTHDAYS.

124
00:05:04,054 --> 00:05:05,764
AH, YES.
AS I RECALL,

125
00:05:05,848 --> 00:05:07,432
YOUR EXACT WORDS
LAST YEAR WERE,

126
00:05:07,516 --> 00:05:09,977
"WHY CELEBRATE
THE PASSAGE OF TIME?"

127
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:12,104
YEAH, WELL, A LOT
HAS CHANGED SINCE THEN.

128
00:05:12,187 --> 00:05:15,023
WE'VE MOVED ON,
GROWN UP.

129
00:05:15,107 --> 00:05:16,692
BOTH MATURED.

130
00:05:16,775 --> 00:05:17,693
EVEN YOU, JT.

131
00:05:17,776 --> 00:05:20,904
(LAUGHS)
HA HA, VERY FUNNY.

132
00:05:20,988 --> 00:05:23,240
MIA'S A LUCKY GIRL.

133
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:26,243
ALAS, SHE'S GONZO
THIS WEEKEND.

134
00:05:28,495 --> 00:05:31,123
WELL, THERE IS
MY BIRTHDAY PARTY.

135
00:05:31,206 --> 00:05:33,041
YOUR PRESENCE WOULDN'T
BE OBJECTED TO.

136
00:05:33,125 --> 00:05:36,211
(LAUGHS) WOW,
WHAT A WARM INVITATION,

137
00:05:36,295 --> 00:05:39,173
CONSIDERING THAT I'M THE ONE
WHO SUGGESTED IT!

138
00:05:39,256 --> 00:05:40,757
YOU TOLD MANNY
TO HOLD A PARTY?

139
00:05:40,841 --> 00:05:41,675
NO BIG.

140
00:05:41,758 --> 00:05:42,718
YOU'VE JUST BEEN
IN A FUNK.

141
00:05:42,801 --> 00:05:44,011
SO I THOUGHT THAT
A BIRTHDAY PARTY

142
00:05:44,094 --> 00:05:45,679
WOULD GIVE YOU SOMETHING
TO SMILE ABOUT.

143
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:48,599
SEE YOU LATER.

144
00:05:52,811 --> 00:05:54,438
MANNY:
YOUR LOVE CHARIOT'S HERE
TO WHISK YOU OFF

145
00:05:54,521 --> 00:05:55,731
TO A LAND OF ROMANCE!

146
00:05:55,814 --> 00:05:57,691
SIMPSON:
IT'S A NATURE RETREAT,
MANNY.

147
00:05:57,774 --> 00:05:59,735
REMEMBER THE RULES:
KEEP THE HOUSE CLEAN

148
00:05:59,818 --> 00:06:01,111
AND NO PARTIES!

149
00:06:01,195 --> 00:06:03,572
DON'T WORRY.
IT'LL BE LIKE YOU NEVER LEFT.

150
00:06:05,157 --> 00:06:08,368
SAY HI TO NATURE FOR ME.

151
00:06:08,452 --> 00:06:10,037
TOBY:
♪ PARTY, PARTY, PART-Y! ♪

152
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,622
♪ PARTY, PARTY, PAR... ♪

153
00:06:14,499 --> 00:06:16,001
WHAT'S WITH
THE CORNY SAMBA?

154
00:06:16,084 --> 00:06:18,504
TOBY:
IS IT WRONG TO BE EXCITED
ABOUT A ROCKIN' BASH

155
00:06:18,587 --> 00:06:19,880
AT CASA EMMA-MANNY?

156
00:06:19,963 --> 00:06:20,297
YES!

157
00:06:20,923 --> 00:06:22,216
BECAUSE IT'S NOT
A ROCKING BASH.

158
00:06:22,299 --> 00:06:23,842
IT'S A TEENY-TINY
BIRTHDAY PARTY

159
00:06:23,926 --> 00:06:25,594
ENDING AT 9:00 SHARP.

160
00:06:25,677 --> 00:06:28,222
THAT'S NOT WHAT
MANNY TOLD ME.

161
00:06:28,305 --> 00:06:29,389
EMMA:
MANNY!

162
00:06:29,473 --> 00:06:31,975
COME ON, EM.
I REALLY NEED THIS.

163
00:06:32,059 --> 00:06:33,727
I KNOW, BUT...

164
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:36,313
SEAN AND I SORT OF
HAD PLANS LATER.

165
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:38,649
OF A ROMANTIC NATURE?

166
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:41,318
NO WAY! REALLY?

167
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:43,153
REALLY.
TONIGHT IS THE NIGHT.

168
00:06:43,237 --> 00:06:45,239
ER... AT LEAST IT WAS.

169
00:06:45,322 --> 00:06:46,532
WELL, ABORT! ABORT!

170
00:06:46,615 --> 00:06:47,491
I'LL SEND BULK EMAILS,

171
00:06:47,574 --> 00:06:49,284
I'LL CARPET BOMB
THE SCHOOL WITH FLYERS.

172
00:06:49,368 --> 00:06:49,868
ANYTHING.

173
00:06:49,952 --> 00:06:52,663
IT'S TOO LATE.
WORD'S OUT.

174
00:06:52,746 --> 00:06:56,166
BUT I GUESS SEAN AND I
COULD STILL...

175
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:57,751
YOU KNOW.

176
00:06:57,835 --> 00:07:00,087
JUST PROMISE IT WON'T
GET TOO CRAZY?

177
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:01,839

356
00:15:40,566 --> 00:15:41,733
BOTH:
(GIGGLE)

357
00:15:41,817 --> 00:15:43,318
SEAN:
WHOA! OH... (LAUGHS)

358
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:46,321
EM, ARE YOU WASTED?

359
00:15:46,405 --> 00:15:49,616
THE QUESTION IS,
AM I WASTED ENOUGH?

360
00:15:51,994 --> 00:15:53,120
(VOMITING)

361
00:15:53,203 --> 00:15:54,079
OH, OKAY.
ALL RIGHT.

362
00:15:55,664 --> 00:15:57,541
WELL,
MARGARITA MEET WASTEBASKET.

363
00:15:57,624 --> 00:15:59,334
WASTEBASKET MEET MARGARITA.

364
00:16:01,378 --> 00:16:02,754
SOMEBODY'S HUNGRY.

365
00:16:04,006 --> 00:16:05,507
MY BEST FRIEND'S LOADED,

366
00:16:05,591 --> 00:16:07,092
I JUST KISSED A STRANGER,

367
00:16:07,176 --> 00:16:10,179
AND THE HOUSE IS COVERED
IN A BOOZY FILM.

368
00:16:10,262 --> 00:16:11,722
WHEN I'M STRESSED,
I EAT.

369
00:16:12,431 --> 00:16:13,849
GLAD I'M NOT THE SOURCE.

370
00:16:15,934 --> 00:16:18,353
MY WORLD DOESN'T REVOLVE
AROUND YOU, ELLIE.

371
00:16:18,437 --> 00:16:20,189
ELLIE:
GOOD.

372
00:16:20,272 --> 00:16:21,356
BUT THAT...

373
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,901
THAT LITTLE VOICE
INSIDE MY HEAD,

374
00:16:23,984 --> 00:16:26,486
IT, IT WANTS ME TO APOLOGIZE

375
00:16:27,821 --> 00:16:29,948
FOR WHAT HAPPENED
WITH CRAIG.

376
00:16:30,032 --> 00:16:31,450
HE FOOLED BOTH OF US.

377
00:16:31,533 --> 00:16:34,536
AND... THANKFULLY,
HE'S FAR, FAR AWAY NOW.

378
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:35,996
IT'S FUNNY THOUGH,

379
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:39,499
I'M-I'M SO INCREDIBLY
PISSED AT CRAIG,

380
00:16:39,583 --> 00:16:41,627
BUT I STILL
THINK ABOUT HIM.

381
00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:43,462
WORRY A LITTLE.

382
00:16:44,046 --> 00:16:45,422
ME, TOO.

383
00:16:45,506 --> 00:16:48,133
HE REALLY MESSED
WITH US.

384
00:16:49,968 --> 00:16:50,928
BOY:
SORRY.

385
00:16:59,394 --> 00:17:01,730
JOHNNY:
HEY. PEACE OFFERING.

386
00:17:05,484 --> 00:17:07,152
(BEER SPRAYS AND FIZZES)

387
00:17:07,236 --> 00:17:07,903
JOHNNY:
(LAUGHING)

388
00:17:08,654 --> 00:17:11,281
JAY:
YOU KNOW WHAT THIS MEANS?
BUH-BYE.

389
00:17:11,365 --> 00:17:13,534
HEY RELAX, SLIM SHADY.
IT'S A PARTY.

390
00:17:13,992 --> 00:17:15,577
AND NOW IT'S TIME TO GO.

391
00:17:15,661 --> 00:17:18,497
JOHNNY:
MAN, GET YOUR HANDS OFF OF ME!

392
00:17:19,790 --> 00:17:21,208
BAD MOVE, DEGRASSI.

393
00:17:25,087 --> 00:17:26,421
PEE BREAK!

394
00:17:28,340 --> 00:17:30,217
KNOW WHAT ROCKS, JT?

395
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:31,468
MAKING OUT...

396
00:17:31,552 --> 00:17:33,345
WITH A CHICK!

397
00:17:33,428 --> 00:17:35,097
WELL, AT LEAST SOMEONE'S
HAVING A GOOD TIME.

398
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:36,974
OH! (LAUGHS)
AM I EVER!

399
00:17:37,057 --> 00:17:39,434
DUDE,
I CAN'T FEEL MY LIPS!

400
00:17:39,518 --> 00:17:40,686
TOBES,

401
00:17:40,769 --> 00:17:42,604
I GOT A SITUATION HERE.

402
00:17:42,688 --> 00:17:44,106
ALL RIGHT, SHOOT.

403
00:17:44,189 --> 00:17:45,691
(EXHALES)
OKAY, SO,

404
00:17:45,774 --> 00:17:48,652
I HAVE THIS MEATBALL SUB,
RIGHT?

405
00:17:48,735 --> 00:17:50,195
YOU KNOW, ZESTY SAUCE,

406
00:17:50,279 --> 00:17:52,865
OOEY-GOOEY CHEESE...
AND-AND I LIKE THE SUB -

407
00:17:52,948 --> 00:17:53,949
A LOT.

408
00:17:54,449 --> 00:17:55,450
BUT... (SIGHS)

409
00:17:55,534 --> 00:17:59,204
SOMEHOW I FIND MYSELF
CRAVING OATMEAL.

410
00:18:00,122 --> 00:18:02,291
THIS A MIA-BALL SUB?

411
00:18:03,625 --> 00:18:05,919
ALL RIGHT.
WELL, IT'S VERY TASTY,

412
00:18:06,003 --> 00:18:07,963
BUT YOU GET TIRED OF IT.

413
00:18:08,046 --> 00:18:09,298
OATMEAL...

414
00:18:09,381 --> 00:18:10,716
IT'S ALWAYS BEEN
THERE FOR YOU.

415
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:13,051
YOU CAN DEPEND ON IT.

416
00:18:14,469 --> 00:18:15,762
I MISS HER, TOBES.

417
00:18:15,846 --> 00:18:18,807
I-I-I KNOW I SHOULDN'T,
BUT I DO.

418
00:18:18,891 --> 00:18:20,350
IT'S SO STUPID.

419
00:18:20,434 --> 00:18:22,102
NO, LOOK,
IT'S NOT STUPID.

420
00:18:22,186 --> 00:18:24,062
YOU CAN'T FIGHT
HOW YOU FEEL.

421
00:18:24,146 --> 00:18:26,815
GO OUT THERE
AND FIND HER.

422
00:18:28,317 --> 00:18:29,818
YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU'RE RIGHT.

423
00:18:29,902 --> 00:18:31,236
YOU'RE ALWAYS RIGHT,
TOBES.

424
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:32,487
I'M GONNA GO OUT THERE
AND I'M GONNA GET MYSELF

425
00:18:32,571 --> 00:18:34,907
A BIG BOWL OF LIBERTY!

426
00:18:35,449 --> 00:18:36,533
OATMEAL.

427
00:18:43,874 --> 00:18:45,042
LIBERTY!

428
00:18:45,834 --> 00:18:47,169
(CRICKETS CHIRP)

429
00:18:52,090 --> 00:18:53,383
COULDN'T FIND A TOILET?

430
00:18:56,386 --> 00:18:57,429
HE DID!

431
00:18:58,931 --> 00:18:59,848
JT:
OH, I GET IT!

432
00:18:59,932 --> 00:19:01,600
MY CAR SUCKS.
HA HA!

433
00:19:02,476 --> 00:19:05,020
YOU GUYS SLAY ME
WITH YOUR HUMOUR!

434
00:19:05,103 --> 00:19:07,356
YEAH, MASCOT BOY?

435
00:19:07,439 --> 00:19:09,107
LAUGH AT THIS.

436
00:19:19,409 --> 00:19:20,953
MAN, WHAT THE HELL
DID YOU DO?!

437
00:19:44,685 --> 00:19:46,436
(HYSTERICAL SCREAMING)
SOMEBODY HELP!

438
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:47,145
PLEASE!

439
00:19:49,231 --> 00:19:51,233
(PANICKED WHIMPERS)

440
00:19:51,316 --> 00:19:52,025
SOMEBODY!

441
00:19:58,991 --> 00:20:01,118
(EXHALES) DRAKE LEMBKE
AND JOHNNY DIMARCO -

442
00:20:01,201 --> 00:20:02,369
BOTH LAKEHURST GUYS.

443
00:20:02,452 --> 00:20:04,830
DETECTIVE:
AND YOU DIDN'T SEE WHICH ONE
COMMITTED THE OFFENCE?

444
00:20:10,252 --> 00:20:11,253
MANNY:
THIS IS ALL MY FAULT.

445
00:20:11,336 --> 00:20:13,213
THIS PARTY WAS MY IDEA.

446
00:20:13,297 --> 00:20:13,589
THIS IS MY FAULT.

447
00:20:13,672 --> 00:20:15,507
MANNY, NO,
IT'S NOT, OKAY?

448
00:20:16,091 --> 00:20:18,093
JT'S HURT.
IT'S SERIOUS.

449
00:20:19,261 --> 00:20:20,762
MOM, I'M SO SORRY.

450
00:20:23,182 --> 00:20:25,684
OKAY.
I'LL SEE YOU SOON.

451
00:20:27,561 --> 00:20:29,855
I NEED TO SPEAK
TO A FAMILY MEMBER.

452
00:20:29,938 --> 00:20:33,859
HIS GRANDMA'S COMING,
BUT SHE'LL BE A FEW HOURS.

453
00:20:33,942 --> 00:20:35,360
TOBY:
WAIT.

454
00:20:36,486 --> 00:20:38,030
YOU CAN TALK TO ME.

455
00:20:38,113 --> 00:20:39,448
I'M HIS BROTHER.

456
00:20:41,074 --> 00:20:42,367
HIS AORTA WAS PUNCTURED.

457
00:20:42,451 --> 00:20:44,203
IT'S A MAIN ARTERY
AND...

458
00:20:44,286 --> 00:20:46,663
WE COULDN'T REPAIR
THE DAMAGE.

459
00:20:46,747 --> 00:20:48,707
HE DIDN'T MAKE IT.

460
00:20:48,790 --> 00:20:50,125
WHA- WHAT?

461
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:53,712
(LAUGH OF DISBELIEF)
YOU'RE JOKING.

462
00:20:53,795 --> 00:20:56,340
I'M SORRY,
YOUR BROTHER'S GONE.

463
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:57,466
(GASPS)

464
00:20:58,967 --> 00:21:00,302
HE'S GONE?

465
00:21:01,303 --> 00:21:01,970
(CRYING)

466
00:21:03,889 --> 00:21:04,890
(LOUD PUNCH)

467
00:21:12,731 --> 00:21:15,692
WHAT HAPPENED?
IS HE OKAY?

468
00:21:15,776 --> 00:21:17,236
WHAT DID THE DOCTOR SAY?

469
00:21:17,319 --> 00:21:18,320
