I JUST NEED A BREAK.

181
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:44,631
IT'S NOTHING TO DO FREAK OVER.

182
00:07:44,715 --> 00:07:46,633
DON'T TELL ME NOT TO FREAK.
YOU'RE DUMPING ME.

183
00:07:46,717 --> 00:07:48,051
I DIDN'T SAY I WAS!

184
00:07:48,135 --> 00:07:49,595
YOU'RE NOT UNDERSTANDING ME.

185
00:07:49,678 --> 00:07:51,263
NO, I THINK I AM.

186
00:07:51,346 --> 00:07:52,806
IT'S SEAN, ISN'T IT?

187
00:07:52,890 --> 00:07:54,975
GOD, I'M SO STUPID.
HOW COULD I TRUST THAT GUY?

188
00:07:55,058 --> 00:07:56,685
PETER, STOP IT.
IT'S NOT SEAN'S FAULT.

189
00:07:56,768 --> 00:07:58,145
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
HOW IT HAPPENED.

190
00:07:58,228 --> 00:07:59,354
WELL DID YOU HAVE
SEX WITH HIM?

191
00:07:59,438 --> 00:07:59,730
NO!

192
00:08:01,064 --> 00:08:02,357
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU'D EVEN ASK ME THAT!

193
00:08:02,441 --> 00:08:03,817
I'M NOT SOME KIND OF SLUT.

194
00:08:03,901 --> 00:08:05,944
COULD'VE FOOLED ME.

195
00:08:08,864 --> 00:08:11,450
NO, EM,
I DIDN'T MEAN IT.

196
00:08:11,533 --> 00:08:12,826
OKAY, FINE!
GOOD LUCK WITH SEAN!

197
00:08:12,910 --> 00:08:16,121

202
00:08:31,094 --> 00:08:33,680
I WAS WONDERING HOW TO GET
SOMETHING PUBLISHED.

203
00:08:33,764 --> 00:08:34,515
FOUND THE RIGHT PERSON.

TOTALLY GENIUS.

209
00:08:44,733 --> 00:08:46,109
WELL I DO HAVE
SOMETHING.

210
00:08:46,193 --> 00:08:48,695
UM, IT'S A FIRST PERSON

211
00:08:48,779 --> 00:08:51,615

213
00:08:55,118 --> 00:08:56,620
GETS BETTER.

214
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:01,708
SO I'LL JUST LEAVE IT THERE

215
00:09:01,792 --> 00:09:04,378
AND MAYBE YOU'LL READ IT.

216
00:09:08,298 --> 00:09:09,925
BUT IF YOU DO PRINT IT,

217
00:09:10,008 --> 00:09:12,052
UM, IT'S GOT TO BE ANONYMOUS.

218
00:09:12,135 --> 00:09:15,556
I WAS KINDA
A LITTLE BIT HARSH.

219
00:09:15,639 --> 00:09:17,140
A LOT HARSH.

220
00:09:19,017 --> 00:09:21,186

00:09:40,122 --> 00:09:40,706
I TOLD YOU,

225
00:09:40,789 --> 00:09:42,040
I'M JUST FOLLOWING UP
ON A TIP.

226
00:09:42,124 --> 00:09:45,043
SO LET'S GET THIS
OVER WITH.

227
00:09:52,968 --> 00:09:54,428
THAT'S NOT MINE.

228
00:09:54,511 --> 00:09:56,597
MS. H, I SWEAR TO YOU,
YOU HAVE TO BELIEVE ME.

SPEAKS FOR ITSELF.

231
00:10:06,273 --> 00:10:06,899
WAIT!

232
00:10:06,982 --> 00:10:09,151
I'M SUSPENDED INDEFINITELY.

233
00:10:09,234 --> 00:10:10,402
I DON'T GET IT.
WHO WOULD DO THIS?

234
00:10:10,485 --> 00:10:11,612
WHO WOULD PLANT DRUGS
IN MY LOCKER?

235

00:10:17,242 --> 00:10:18,368
YES. BUT-

238
00:10:18,452 --> 00:10:19,036
HE DID THIS!

239
00:10:19,119 --> 00:10:20,120
THAT'S RIDICULOUS.

240
00:10:20,204 --> 00:10:21,705
YEAH?
HE'S THE PRINCIPAL'S SON.

241
00:10:21,788 --> 00:10:23,874

TO GET INTO MY LOCKER.

THAT SOUNDS?

YOU THINK I ACTUALLY
SELL DRUGS?

248

NO, BUT...

249
00:10:42,768 --> 00:10:45,562
