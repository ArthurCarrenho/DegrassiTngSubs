00:00:02,794 --> 00:00:04,838
DARCY:
YOU CALL THAT A KISS?

2
00:00:04,922 --> 00:00:06,757
SPINNER:
I CAN FEEL YOUR MOM'S EYES
WATCHING US

3
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:08,008
FROM INSIDE THE HOUSE.

4
00:00:08,091 --> 00:00:09,843
YEAH AND CLARE'S PROBABLY
HIDING IN THE BUSHES

5
00:00:09,927 --> 00:00:11,970
VIDEOTAPING FOR EVIDENCE.

6
00:00:12,054 --> 00:00:13,222
NO. NO, NO, NO.

7
00:00:13,305 --> 00:00:15,390
THAT WOULD BE WRONG.

8
00:00:15,474 --> 00:00:17,267
AND YOU AND YOUR SIS
NEVER DO ANYTHING WRONG.

9
00:00:17,351 --> 00:00:19,603
YOU'RE LIKE
REGULAR SAINTS.

10
00:00:19,686 --> 00:00:21,772
CLARE IS A SAINT.

11
00:00:21,855 --> 00:00:23,315
I'M NOT.

12
00:00:23,398 --> 00:00:26,109
I CAN BE BAD
SOMETIMES TOO.

13
00:00:30,113 --> 00:00:33,116
DON'T JUDGE A BOOK
BY ITS COVER.

14
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,993
CLARE:
WHY ARE YOU SO ADDICTED
TO WRITING A DUMB BLOG

15
00:00:35,077 --> 00:00:36,370
NO ONE READS?

16
00:00:36,453 --> 00:00:37,246
I'M NOT ADDICTED,

17
00:00:37,329 --> 00:00:39,456
AND PEOPLE DO READ IT.

18
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:41,250
THERE'S A WHOLE ONLINE
COMMUNITY OF PEOPLE

00:00:41,333 --> 00:00:43,043
WHO ARE ONE HUNDRED
ZILLION TIMES

00:00:43,126 --> 00:00:44,378
LESS ANNOYING
THAN YOU ARE.

21
00:00:44,461 --> 00:00:45,879
IT'S GOOD YOU'VE GOT
FRIENDS SOMEWHERE,

22
00:00:45,963 --> 00:00:48,674
EVEN IF THEY
ARE INVISIBLE.

23
00:00:50,133 --> 00:00:50,968
UGH.

CHANTAY:
THE NEW UNIFORM WOULD BE
A DARKER BLUE

28
00:01:49,276 --> 00:01:50,777
THAN THE PANTHER BLUE
WE HAVE NOW.

29
00:01:50,861 --> 00:01:52,487
THAT'S OKAY.
I HATE PANTHER BLUE.

30
00:01:52,571 --> 00:01:53,530
US TOO.

31
00:01:53,614 --> 00:01:56,116
AND THEY COME IN
ULTRA-FASHIONABLE,

32
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:58,911
MODERN, ATHLETIC,
CROP-TOP STYLE!

33
00:01:58,994 --> 00:01:59,703
CROP-TOPS?

34
00:01:59,786 --> 00:02:00,954
COME ON, WE'RE NOT
FLASHING OUR ABS

35
00:02:01,038 --> 00:02:02,873
AT THE ENTIRE SCHOOL.

36
00:02:02,956 --> 00:02:04,833
OKAY, FORGET ABOUT
THE CROP-TOPS.

37
00:02:04,917 --> 00:02:06,126
HOW ABOUT AT LEAST
GETTING US

38
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:08,629
SOME NEW SHORT-SHORTS?

39
00:02:08,712 --> 00:02:10,964
THOSE SHORTS-SHORTS
ARE A LITTLE TOO SHORT.

40
00:02:11,048 --> 00:02:12,299
WAY TOO MUCH LEG.

41
00:02:12,382 --> 00:02:13,759
THE LAKEHURST SQUAD
WEARS THEM.

42
00:02:13,842 --> 00:02:14,801
AND DARCY,

43
00:02:14,885 --> 00:02:16,803
THEY'D BE SO MUCH EASIER
TO MOVE AROUND IN.

44
00:02:16,887 --> 00:02:17,513
WHICH WE'LL NEED

45
00:02:17,596 --> 00:02:19,139
FOR THE ATHLETIC ROUTINES
MANNY'S WORKED OUT

46
00:02:19,223 --> 00:02:21,600
TO GET US TO THE REGIONALS?

47
00:02:21,683 --> 00:02:23,519
THEN CHANGE
THE ROUTINES.

48
00:02:23,602 --> 00:02:25,562
LOOK, WE CAN'T EVEN AFFORD
TO GET NEW UNIFORMS,

49
00:02:25,646 --> 00:02:26,855
SO CAN WE JUST DROP IT?

50
00:02:26,939 --> 00:02:28,524
BESIDES,
I HAVE MY OWN ANSWER

51
00:02:28,607 --> 00:02:30,067
TO GETTING US
INTO REGIONALS.

52
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:31,902
BOYS.

53
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:34,404
NOT THAT I HAVE ANYTHING AGAINST
THAT ANSWER GENERALLY,

54
00:02:34,488 --> 00:02:36,323
BUT PARDON?

55
00:02:36,406 --> 00:02:38,283
MORE LIFTS,
MORE THROWS.

56
00:02:38,367 --> 00:02:38,992
I THOUGHT OF IT YESTERDAY

57
00:02:39,076 --> 00:02:40,994
WHEN I WAS WATCHING
SOME PRO-STYLE ON TV.

58
00:02:41,078 --> 00:02:42,913
SO YOU JUST DECIDED

59
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:44,665
WITHOUT TALKING
TO THE CHOREOGRAPHER?

60
00:02:44,748 --> 00:02:47,918
THAT'S WHY I LOVE
BEING CAPTAIN.

61
00:02:49,294 --> 00:02:50,003
MANNY:
IS IT POSSIBLE THAT

62
00:02:50,087 --> 00:02:53,799
I'M ACTUALLY MISSING
PAIGE MICHALCHUK?

63
00:02:57,386 --> 00:02:58,053
GOOD MORNING,
EMMA.

64
00:02:58,136 --> 00:02:58,887
NOTHING ABOUT YOU
IS GOOD,

65
00:02:58,971 --> 00:03:01,181
AND DON'T TALK
TO ME.

66
00:03:02,307 --> 00:03:03,851
OFF TO CLASS,
PETER MICHAEL.

67
00:03:03,934 --> 00:03:06,478
PLEASE FOCUS ON YOUR STUDIES
INSTEAD OF GIRLS.

68
00:03:06,562 --> 00:03:08,647
EMMA'S MORE
THAN JUST A GIRL.

69
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:10,983
I SAID,

CAPTAIN OF YOUR SPIRIT SQUAD.

92
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:53,483
DID YOU KNOW GEORGE W. BUSH
USED TO BE A CHEERLEADER?

93
00:03:53,567 --> 00:03:54,776
SO WHY NOT YOU TOO?

94
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:56,570
YOUR SQUAD NEEDS NEW SHOULDERS
TO LEAN ON.

95
00:03:56,653 --> 00:03:57,821
BROAD SHOULDERS.

96
00:03:57,905 --> 00:03:58,405
THAT'S RIGHT GUYS,

97
00:03:58,488 --> 00:04:01,241
IT'S YOUR TURN
TO SHOW SCHOOL SPIRIT!

98
00:04:01,325 --> 00:04:01,950
GOOD ANNOUNCEMENT.

99
00:04:02,034 --> 00:04:03,118
THANKS.

100
00:04:03,952 --> 00:04:06,205
WHAT DO YOU HAVE
AGAINST SHORT-SHORTS?

101
00:04:06,288 --> 00:04:08,790
DON'T YOU THINK SPIRIT SQUAD
HAS AN IMAGE TO MAINTAIN?

102
00:04:08,874 --> 00:04:10,918
A "WE'RE NOT DIRTY"
KIND OF IMAGE?

103
00:04:11,001 --> 00:04:12,586
SHORTS AREN'T DIRTY.

104
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:13,504
CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG,

105
00:04:13,587 --> 00:04:15,589
BUT AREN'T YOU WEARING SHORTS
IN YOUR MY-ROOM-PAGE?

106
00:04:15,672 --> 00:04:17,549
THEY SHOW LIKE
THIS MUCH MORE THIGH.

107
00:04:17,633 --> 00:04:19,843
SO?
YOU HAVE GOOD THIGHS.

108
00:04:19,927 --> 00:04:21,512
ANYONE WHO GOES TO YOUR
MY-ROOM-PAGE WOULD KNOW.

109
00:04:22,054 --> 00:04:22,846
CAN YOU STAY OUT
OF THIS?

110
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,682
I'M JUST SAYING
YOUR BLOG IS GOOD.

111
00:04:25,766 --> 00:04:26,934
THOSE QUIZZES YOU DO
ARE FUN.

112
00:04:28,769 --> 00:04:29,770
SIMPSON: (UNENTHUSIASTIC)
IT'S HARD-DRIVE MAINTENANCE DAY.

113
00:04:29,853 --> 00:04:31,939
CAN YOU STAND THE EXCITEMENT?
I CAN'T.

114
00:04:32,022 --> 00:04:33,607
(SCHOOL BELL RINGS)

115
00:04:35,901 --> 00:04:36,610
JT:
AND THEN?

116
00:04:36,693 --> 00:04:38,070
THEN SHE GAVE ME
THAT LIBERTY LOOK.

117
00:04:38,153 --> 00:04:38,946
THAT LOOK THAT SAYS

118
00:04:39,029 --> 00:04:40,113
"YOU'RE SO IMMATURE
AND PATHETIC

119
00:04:40,197 --> 00:04:42,241
THAT I CAN'T EVEN FIND
THE WORDS TO DESCRIBE IT."

120
00:04:42,324 --> 00:04:43,492
YOU MEAN,
THAT LOOK THAT SAYS,

121
00:04:43,575 --> 00:04:45,285
"MY PASSION FOR YOU
BURNS BRIGHT, JT.

122
00:04:45,369 --> 00:04:46,954
IT IS AN ETERNAL FLAME
OF MUCH LOVENESS."

123
00:04:47,037 --> 00:04:48,038
TOBES, STOP IT.

124
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:48,956
YOU'RE MAKING ME ILL.

125
00:04:49,039 --> 00:04:50,624
LOOK, IT'S NOT
JUST YOU, JT.

126
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:52,125
IT'S... IT'S HER.

127
00:04:52,209 --> 00:04:53,585
YOU NEVER STOP
TALKING ABOUT HER.

128
00:04:53,669 --> 00:04:55,462
YOU'RE LIKE, OBSESSED.

129
00:04:55,546 --> 00:04:57,339
JT:
TOBES, OBSESSING OVER LIBERTY
WOULD BE LIKE...

130
00:04:57,422 --> 00:05:00,300
OBSESSING OVER LINT
OR OATMEAL.

131
00:05:00,384 --> 00:05:02,135
MIA:
OHMIGOD, THAT'S IT!

132
00:05:02,219 --> 00:05:05,389
YOU'RE PJ JT!
MY KID LOVES YOU.

133
00:05:05,472 --> 00:05:06,306
YOU HAVE A KID?

134
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:07,307
HER NAME'S ISABELLA.

135
00:05:07,391 --> 00:05:08,183
SHE'S YOUR BIGGEST FAN.

136
00:05:08,267 --> 00:05:09,476
AND SHE WON'T EVEN LET ME
TURN OFF THE TV

137
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,144
WHEN THEY'RE RERUNNING YOU.

138
00:05:11,228 --> 00:05:11,979
YEAH?

139
00:05:12,062 --> 00:05:13,230
YEAH.

140
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:14,773
REMIND ME TO GET YOUR AUTOGRAPH
FOR HER.

141
00:05:14,857 --> 00:05:15,899
I THINK YOU'RE HER
FIRST CRUSH.

142
00:05:17,234 --> 00:05:19,403
THAT IS NOT OATMEAL.

143
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,864
THAT IS A HOMEMADE
MEATBALL SUB

144
00:05:21,947 --> 00:05:24,324
WITH EXTRA CHEESE
AND SPICY SAUCE.

145
00:05:24,408 --> 00:05:25,742
LOOK, TELL MR. PERINO
THAT UH...

146
00:05:25,826 --> 00:05:26,994
THAT I CAUGHT BIRD FLU.

147
00:05:27,077 --> 00:05:30,080
I'VE GOT AN AUDITION
TO GO TO!

148
00:05:31,123 --> 00:05:32,541
(STAINING GRUNTS)

149
00:05:34,084 --> 00:05:36,295
SO THAT'S YOUR
GREAT IDEA.

150
00:05:36,378 --> 00:05:38,547
TURNING SPIRT SQUAD
INTO DORKWAD CENTRAL?

151
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:40,716
SOMEHOW IT LOOKED A BIT
DIFFERENT IN MY HEAD.

152
00:05:40,799 --> 00:05:42,551
SORRY I'M LATE!

153
00:05:44,094 --> 00:05:46,930
THIS WHOLE BOY IDEA
IS OFFICIALLY DEAD.

154
00:05:47,014 --> 00:05:48,307
THEY'RE ALL GOING HOME.

155
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:49,099
HOME! GO!

156
00:05:54,897 --> 00:05:55,731
WAIT-WAIT-WAIT-WAIT.

157
00:05:55,814 --> 00:05:59,359
PETER MIGHT ACTUALLY
BE OKAY AT THIS.

158
00:05:59,443 --> 00:06:01,028
"OKAY" IS NOT A PETER WORD.

159
00:06:01,111 --> 00:06:04,531
TRY UM...
"PSYCHO, SERIAL KILLER-Y."

160
00:06:04,615 --> 00:06:06,033
UH..."SATANIC"
IN YOUR LANGUAGE.

161
00:06:06,116 --> 00:06:07,201
I'M RIGHT HERE,
MANNY.

162
00:06:07,284 --> 00:06:08,702
I DO HAVE EARS,
YOU KNOW?

163
00:06:08,785 --> 00:06:11,163
SO IT'S JUST A SOUL
YOU'RE MISSING?

164
00:06:11,246 --> 00:06:12,706
UM, WHERE'S THE PART

165
00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:15,417
WHERE I GET TO GRAB
MANNY'S INNER THIGHS?

166
00:06:15,501 --> 00:06:17,127
AS IF I'M LETTING
YOU PICK ME UP.

167
00:06:17,211 --> 00:06:18,462
I'VE SEEN MORE
GRACEFUL CAMELS.

168
00:06:19,463 --> 00:06:19,963
MAYBE.

169
00:06:20,839 --> 00:06:22,549
BUT I GOT TWICE THE HUMP.

170
00:06:22,633 --> 00:06:23,759
(CHUCKLES)
YEAH-HOO!

171
00:06:23,842 --> 00:06:24,927
DARCY:
OKAY, GUYS,

172
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:26,386
LET'S GET THESE
TRY-OUT STARTED.

173
00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:28,138
UM, I WANT TO START
WITH SOME LIFTS

174
00:06:28,222 --> 00:06:29,389
BECAUSE WIMPS LIFT WEIGHTS

175
00:06:29,473 --> 00:06:31,600
AND CHEERLEADERS LIFT PEOPLE.

176
00:06:31,683 --> 00:06:32,976
AMEN, SISTER.

177
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:33,727
TESTIFY.

178
00:06:34,561 --> 00:06:35,604
DARCY:
YEAH. AMEN.

179
00:06:35,687 --> 00:06:37,814
UM, PETER,
YOU CAN HELP ME DEMONSTRATE.

180
00:06:37,898 --> 00:06:38,732
UH, DO YOU MIND SPOTTING?

181
00:06:38,815 --> 00:06:39,399
GIRL:
SURE.

182
00:06:39,483 --> 00:06:40,484
DARCY:
STAND BEHIND ME HERE.

183
00:06:40,567 --> 00:06:42,903
I'LL STAND HERE.
GRAB MY WAIST.

184
00:06:42,986 --> 00:06:43,904
I'LL HOLD YOUR WRISTS.
I'M GONNA COUNT.

185
00:06:43,987 --> 00:06:45,155
READY?

186
00:06:45,239 --> 00:06:46,490
1, 2, DOWN, UP.

187
00:06:47,908 --> 00:06:48,784
PERFECT!

188
00:06:48,867 --> 00:06:50,077
RIGHT, MANNY?

189
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,578
I FEEL REGIONALS.

190
00:06:59,503 --> 00:07:00,504
DARCY:
(CLEARS THROAT)

191
00:07:01,088 --> 00:07:02,089
DARCY! HEY!

192
00:07:02,172 --> 00:07:03,757
I HAVE A BOYFRIEND
YOU KNOW.

193
00:07:03,841 --> 00:07:05,509
OH, IT'S NOT
LIKE THAT.

194
00:07:05,592 --> 00:07:06,969
I JUST WANT TO THANK YOU
FOR IN THERE.

195
00:07:07,052 --> 00:07:07,594
WHATEVER.

196
00:07:07,678 --> 00:07:11,515
I JUST BELIEVE THAT SOMETIMES
PEOPLE DESERVE FORGIVENESS.

197
00:07:11,598 --> 00:07:13,767
YOU REALLY WANT
TO BE A CHEERLEADER?

198
00:07:13,851 --> 00:07:16,103
HATZILAKOS:
PETER MICHAEL,
TWO MINUTES, OKAY?

199
00:07:16,186 --> 00:07:17,604
OKAY, MOM!

200
00:07:19,022 --> 00:07:20,440
I'M STUCK IN THIS HOUSE
ARREST THING.

201
00:07:20,524 --> 00:07:21,942
BUT IF I JOIN A CLUB-

202
00:07:22,025 --> 00:07:24,278
YOU GET AN EXCUSE
TO STAY OUT LONGER.

203
00:07:24,361 --> 00:07:25,112
I GET IT.

204
00:07:25,195 --> 00:07:26,446
I'VE BEEN WARNED
ABOUT YOU.

205
00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:28,115
I'M BORED, OKAY?

206
00:07:28,198 --> 00:07:29,992
I'M GETTING A'S
IN EVERYTHING.

207
00:07:30,075 --> 00:07:31,535
I'VE READ THE BLOG
OF EVERY BORING KID

208
00:07:31,618 --> 00:07:33,829
IN THIS ENTIRE
BORING SCHOOL.

209
00:07:33,912 --> 00:07:35,622
INCLUDING MY BORING BLOG?

210
00:07:35,706 --> 00:07:36,999
NO, I ACTUALLY
LIKED YOURS.

211
00:07:37,082 --> 00:07:38,208
YOU'RE NOT WHO
I THOUGHT YOU WERE.

212
00:07:38,292 --> 00:07:39,293
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

213
00:07:39,376 --> 00:07:40,794
YOU'RE COOLER
THAN I THOUGHT.

214
00:07:40,878 --> 00:07:42,629
AND SMART AND FUNNY.

215
00:07:42,713 --> 00:07:44,798
LOOK PRETTY CUTE
IN SHORTS.

216
00:07:44,882 --> 00:07:46,049
GOOD NIGHT,
MS. HATZILAKOS!

217
00:07:46,133 --> 00:07:48,343
I THINK PETER'S READY
TO GO HOME, NOW.

218
00:07:48,427 --> 00:07:50,512
HATZILAKOS:
THANKS, DARCY.
GOOD NIGHT!

219
00:07:50,596 --> 00:07:51,889
I'M GONNA LINK YOU UP
TO MY BLOG, ALL RIGHT?

220
00:07:51,972 --> 00:07:52,723
I KNOW A LOT
OF PEOPLE.

221
00:07:55,309 --> 00:07:56,435
COME ON.
TIME TO GO HOME.

222
00:07:58,562 --> 00:08:00,314
JT:
AND THAT'S IT FOR TODAY.

223
00:08:00,397 --> 00:08:01,273
SO REMEMBER,

224
00:08:01,356 --> 00:08:03,192
IMAGINE ALL WEEK LONG.

225
00:08:03,817 --> 00:08:05,027
AND DON'T EAT THE GLUE!

226
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:05,777
BYE-BYE!

227
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:09,281
(WEAK APPLAUSE)

228
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:11,992
SO AM I... AM I FIRED

229
00:08:12,075 --> 00:08:13,785
FOR CUTTING MY FINGER
WITH THE SAFETY SCISSORS

230
00:08:13,869 --> 00:08:14,536
OR WHAT?

231
00:08:15,412 --> 00:08:16,371
YOU COVERED WELL.

232
00:08:16,455 --> 00:08:18,081
NOW, CAN YOU TELL US WHY
YOU WANT YOUR OLD JOB BACK?

233
00:08:19,041 --> 00:08:20,250
WELL,
IT'S FOR THE CHICKS.

234
00:08:20,334 --> 00:08:21,084
(GIGGLES)

235
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,170
VERY FUNNY, JT.

236
00:08:23,253 --> 00:08:24,713
BUT SERIOUSLY?

237
00:08:24,796 --> 00:08:27,549
JT:
WELL, RESPECT, I GUESS.

238
00:08:27,633 --> 00:08:28,050
YEAH.

239
00:08:29,134 --> 00:08:30,344
I KNOW IT SOUNDS WHACKO,

240
00:08:30,427 --> 00:08:32,596
BUT MAKING ARTS AND CRAFTS

241
00:08:33,388 --> 00:08:37,309
AND WEARING DRESS-UP COSTUMES,
IT HELPS ME GAIN IT.

242
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:39,770
FEEL RESPECTED...LIKE.

243
00:08:47,736 --> 00:08:49,696
WELL THEN,
PREPARE FOR RESPECT.

244
00:08:54,368 --> 00:08:56,286
SEE YOU TOMORROW,
BABY.

245
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:57,788
THAT'S IT?

246
00:08:57,871 --> 00:08:59,540
OKAY,
WHAT'D I FORGET?

247
00:08:59,623 --> 00:09:00,916
UM, ENJOY YOUR DINNER.

248
00:09:00,999 --> 00:09:03,085
REMEMBER TO PRAY.
WHAT?

249
00:09:03,168 --> 00:09:05,420
YOU DON'T WANT
TO KISS ME MORE?

250
00:09:05,504 --> 00:09:06,755
I MAKE OUT WITH YOU
TOO MUCH,

251
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:08,257
I'M A HORN DOG;

252
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:09,216
I DON'T MAKE OUT
WITH YOU,

253
00:09:09,299 --> 00:09:11,051
AND I'M IN TROUBLE?

254
00:09:11,134 --> 00:09:12,511
HOW CAN I WIN?

255
00:09:12,594 --> 00:09:14,304
IT'S NOT ABOUT WINNING.

256
00:09:14,388 --> 00:09:17,391
IT'S ABOUT RESPECTING
EACH OTHER'S NEEDS.

257
00:09:17,474 --> 00:09:19,601
I DO RESPECT YOU,
DARCE.

258
00:09:19,685 --> 00:09:21,854
THAT'S WHAT ALL
THIS IS ABOUT -

259
00:09:21,937 --> 00:09:23,856
RESPECT,
ABSTINENCE,

260
00:09:23,939 --> 00:09:26,191
CHASTITY,
BEING GOOD.

261
00:09:26,984 --> 00:09:30,237
DON'T YOU GET TIRED
OF BEING GOOD?

262
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,739
WHAT'RE YOU SAYING,
DARCY?

263
00:09:32,823 --> 00:09:33,866
WHAT DO YOU WANT ME
TO DO?

264
00:09:33,949 --> 00:09:35,701
JUST TELL ME.

265
00:09:35,784 --> 00:09:38,704
I CAN'T...
'CAUSE I DON'T KNOW.

266
00:09:38,787 --> 00:09:41,623
I JUST...
I NEED MORE...SOMETHING.

267
00:09:44,835 --> 00:09:47,087
FORGET IT,
OKAY?

268
00:09:47,171 --> 00:09:49,089
CAN WE JUST FORGET IT?

269
00:09:49,173 --> 00:09:51,466
FINE.
IT'S FORGOTTEN.

270
00:09:58,307 --> 00:09:59,474
IS YOUR BRA
STILL DONE UP?

271
00:09:59,558 --> 00:10:00,934
IT'S EXACTLY
WHERE IT SHOULD BE.

272
00:10:04,104 --> 00:10:05,689
CLARE:
YOUR EMAIL SOUND
KEEPS GOING.

273
00:10:14,865 --> 00:10:18,243
MOM:
CLARE, COME AND SET THE TABLE!

274
00:10:20,662 --> 00:10:23,498
MOM SAID SHE NEEDS HELP
WITH DINNER. GO.

275
00:10:23,582 --> 00:10:23,957
BUT...

276
00:10:24,041 --> 00:10:24,750
GO.

277
00:10:25,584 --> 00:10:26,335
GO!

278
00:11:09,753 --> 00:11:11,004
(GIGGLES)

279
00:11:11,672 --> 00:11:13,674
WHAT'S THE STORY,
MORNING GLORY?

280
00:11:13,757 --> 00:11:16,593
THE STORY IS
YOU'RE CUTE.

281
00:11:16,677 --> 00:11:19,680
HEY, I HAVE SOMETHING
FOR YOU.

282
00:11:21,306 --> 00:11:22,683
THANK YOU.

283
00:11:22,766 --> 00:11:23,976
I MADE IT OUT OF
THIS LEATHER JACKET

284
00:11:24,059 --> 00:11:25,602
THAT I USED TO WEAR
WHEN I WAS A KID.

285
00:11:25,686 --> 00:11:27,563
SO...

286
00:11:27,646 --> 00:11:29,565
I'M SO LUCKY I HAVE YOU.

287
00:11:30,357 --> 00:11:31,650
(GIGGLES)

288
00:11:35,404 --> 00:11:36,154
AW...

289
00:11:51,170 --> 00:11:52,921
LOOKS LIKE I MADE YOU
PRETTY POPULAR.

290
00:11:53,005 --> 00:11:54,923
IN THE ONLINE WORLD
ANYWAY.

291
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:56,258
I LINKED YOUR BLOG UP
TO MY WEBSITE.

292
00:11:56,341 --> 00:11:58,677
SENT A LOT OF MY FRIENDS
YOUR WAY.

293
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:00,012
WHO'S THAT ADAMS GUY?

294
00:12:00,095 --> 00:12:01,430
IS HE A FRIEND OF YOURS?

295
00:12:01,513 --> 00:12:02,556
YEAH, WE'RE TIGHT.

296
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:04,892
REALLY.
SO... WHAT'S HE LIKE?

297
00:12:04,975 --> 00:12:06,393
YOU MEAN WHAT DOES
HE LOOK LIKE?

298
00:12:06,476 --> 00:12:07,728
I KNOW WHERE
THIS IS GOING.

299
00:12:07,811 --> 00:12:10,480
NO YOU DON'T.
AND DON'T BE A CREEP.

300
00:12:10,564 --> 00:12:12,191
ADAMS IS COOL.

301
00:12:12,274 --> 00:12:14,109
HE'S AN OLD BUD
FROM PRIVATE SCHOOL.

302
00:12:14,193 --> 00:12:16,904
HIS DAD'S SUPER RICH.
HE PLAYS SOCCER.

303
00:12:16,987 --> 00:12:18,614
GIRLS SAY HE'S CUTE.

304
00:12:18,697 --> 00:12:20,407
HE'S DEFINITELY A BIG FAN
OF YOURS RIGHT NOW.

305
00:12:22,326 --> 00:12:23,702
ALL RIGHT, FOLKS!

306
00:12:23,785 --> 00:12:24,995
POP QUIZ ON MOTHERBOARDS.

307
00:12:25,078 --> 00:12:25,787
'CAUSE LET'S FACE IT,

308
00:12:25,871 --> 00:12:27,039
WHO DOESN'T LOVE
A GOOD MOTHERBOARD.

309
00:12:28,373 --> 00:12:29,166
HANDS ON HIPS,
RIGHT?

310
00:12:29,249 --> 00:12:29,666
1, 2...

311
00:12:33,378 --> 00:12:34,254
OKAY, UM...

312
00:12:34,338 --> 00:12:36,173
TRY THE LIFT AGAIN,
SPAGHETTI ARMS.

313
00:12:36,256 --> 00:12:37,841
AND DON'T TICKLE HIM
THIS TIME.

314
00:12:37,925 --> 00:12:39,635
I WANT TO LIFT
A LADY.

315
00:12:39,718 --> 00:12:40,802
MANNY:
WELL, NONE OF THEM WANT
TO COME NEAR YOU,

316
00:12:40,886 --> 00:12:42,221
WHICH I DON'T THINK
IS IN YOUR FAVOUR

317
00:12:42,304 --> 00:12:44,389
FOR THE WHOLE
MAKE-THE-TEAM THING.

318
00:12:45,807 --> 00:12:47,226
HAVE YOU SEEN THIS?

319
00:12:53,899 --> 00:12:55,526
HOLY KAMOLEY.

320
00:12:55,609 --> 00:12:58,237
HE DID RESEARCH.
HE PRACTICED.

321
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,863
YEAH, THIS IS BETTER
THAN HALF THE GIRLS

322
00:12:59,947 --> 00:13:01,114
ON THE TEAM.

323
00:13:01,198 --> 00:13:02,991
YOU'RE RIGHT.

324
00:13:03,075 --> 00:13:05,160
GUY MIGHT BE THE TWISTED-UP
SPAWN OF SATAN,

325
00:13:05,244 --> 00:13:08,121
BUT HE ALSO MIGHT BE OUR TICKET
TO THE REGIONALS.

326
00:13:08,205 --> 00:13:09,122
DARCY:
YEAH.

327
00:13:09,206 --> 00:13:11,583
HE'S FULL OF SURPRISES.

328
00:13:14,086 --> 00:13:15,379
WELL...

329
00:13:15,462 --> 00:13:16,547
SEE, LOOK AT THAT!

330
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:17,714
LOOK AT THAT!

331
00:13:26,098 --> 00:13:27,015
PJ JT.

332
00:13:27,015 --> 00:13:28,183
OH HI.

333
00:13:29,476 --> 00:13:30,227
HAS ANYONE EVER TOLD YOU

334
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:33,355
THAT'S A LOT OF LETTERS
FOR ONE LITTLE GUY?

335
00:13:33,438 --> 00:13:36,108
LITTLE?
WHAT DID YOU HEAR?

336
00:13:38,402 --> 00:13:39,736
YOU KNOW WHAT?
FORGET IT.

337
00:13:43,699 --> 00:13:45,284
I-I GOT MY JOB BACK!

338
00:13:45,367 --> 00:13:45,993
CONGRATS!

339
00:13:46,076 --> 00:13:47,744
JT:
OH! OOH. THANKS!

340
00:13:49,621 --> 00:13:50,372
UH...

341
00:13:51,290 --> 00:13:52,457
UM...YEAH...

342
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:55,586
YOU SHOULD COME
TO THE SHOW!

343
00:13:55,669 --> 00:13:57,379
OH, I WOULDN'T WANT
TO GET IN THE WAY.

344
00:13:57,462 --> 00:13:58,380
OH, NO.
IT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

345
00:13:58,463 --> 00:13:59,965
JUST COME TO A TAPING
WITH YOUR DAUGHTER.

346
00:14:00,048 --> 00:14:01,216
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

347
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:02,217
SHE'D LOVE THAT.

348
00:14:02,301 --> 00:14:03,302
YEAH.
COME TONIGHT.

349
00:14:03,385 --> 00:14:04,219
IT'S THE PREMIERE.

350
00:14:04,303 --> 00:14:05,721
IT'S GONNA BE LIKE
TEN TIMES THE EXCITEMENT.

351
00:14:05,804 --> 00:14:08,182
THE CATERERS HEAT THE COFFEE
TO LUKEWARM INSTEAD OF TEPID.

352
00:14:08,265 --> 00:14:08,891
IT'S REALLY...

353
00:14:08,974 --> 00:14:10,517
ISABELLA WOULD
DEFINITELY LOVE THAT!

354
00:14:10,601 --> 00:14:11,977
WE'LL BE THERE

362
00:14:35,334 --> 00:14:37,294
DOESN'T MEAN I SUDDENLY THINK

363
00:14:37,377 --> 00:14:39,505
I'M NOT MOTHER THERESA.
