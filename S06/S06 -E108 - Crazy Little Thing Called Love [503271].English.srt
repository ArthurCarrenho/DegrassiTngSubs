00:00:11,094 --> 00:00:12,804
HEY,
SIGHT FOR SORE EYES.

2
00:00:12,888 --> 00:00:14,473
OH, YEAH.

3
00:00:15,849 --> 00:00:16,934
MMM...

4
00:00:18,852 --> 00:00:20,354
I'M FREE...

5
00:00:20,437 --> 00:00:21,605
ALL THANKS TO YOU.

6
00:00:21,688 --> 00:00:23,190
ALL I DID WAS HELP YOU
GET A LAWYER.

7
00:00:23,273 --> 00:00:24,316
YOU GOT ME A HEARING,

8
00:00:24,399 --> 00:00:25,609
YOU GOT MY SENTENCE
REDUCED-

9
00:00:25,692 --> 00:00:26,860
AND TWO YEARS
OF PROBATION.

10
00:00:26,944 --> 00:00:29,196
WHATEVER. I'M OUT.

11
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:31,198
NOW WE CAN BE TOGETHER:

12
00:00:31,281 --> 00:00:31,698
THE PERFECT GIRL

13
00:00:31,782 --> 00:00:34,284
AND THE GUY
WHO DOESN'T DESERVE HER.

14
00:00:34,368 --> 00:00:36,370
MAN, I MISSED YOU.

15
00:00:39,998 --> 00:00:42,501
I MISSED YOU, TOO.
A LOT.

16
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:44,127
YEAH?

17
00:00:44,962 --> 00:00:47,881
I ALSO MISSED BACON
DOUBLE CHEESEBURGERS,

18
00:00:47,965 --> 00:00:49,341
WITH THE WORKS!

19
00:00:49,424 --> 00:00:51,218
I SEE JAIL HASN'T
TURNED YOU VEGETARIAN.

20
00:00:51,301 --> 00:00:52,386
SORRY.

21
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:54,638
BEEN DREAMING ABOUT IT
FOR MONTHS.

22
00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:55,681
I GUESS I COULD PUT

23
00:00:55,764 --> 00:00:57,391
MY CARNIVOROUS
OBJECTIONS ASIDE,

24
00:00:57,474 --> 00:00:58,934
JUST THIS ONCE.

25
00:00:59,017 --> 00:01:01,895
BUT FIRST,
IT'S PRESENT TIME.

26
00:01:07,109 --> 00:01:08,151
IS THAT REALLY US?

27
00:01:09,152 --> 00:01:12,155
EMMA:
SIX UBER LONG YEARS AGO.

28
00:01:13,532 --> 00:01:16,785
SOMETIMES I WISH I COULD
STOP TIME.

29
00:01:16,869 --> 00:01:18,036
GO BACK.

30
00:01:19,288 --> 00:01:20,664
TO BAD HAIR,
BRACES,

31
00:01:20,747 --> 00:01:23,584
AND GENERAL PUBESCENT
AWKWARDNESS?

32
00:01:23,667 --> 00:01:25,002
NO THANKS.

33
00:01:27,171 --> 00:01:31,091
BACK TO A TIME
WHEN YOU WERE PROUD OF ME.

37
00:02:20,057 --> 00:02:21,767
SIMPSON:
HOW WAS THE SOFA?
NOT TOO LUMPY?

38
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:22,559
MMMM.

39
00:02:22,643 --> 00:02:24,478
NO, IT WAS GREAT.
THANKS.

40
00:02:24,561 --> 00:02:25,479
I REALLY APPRECIATE
YOU GUYS

41
00:02:25,562 --> 00:02:26,146
LETTING ME CRASH HERE

42
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:27,773
UNTIL I GET BACK
ON MY FEET.

43
00:02:27,856 --> 00:02:29,650
SPIKE:
WHAT'RE YOUR PLANS
NOW THAT YOU'RE OUT?

44
00:02:29,733 --> 00:02:32,277
ALREADY WITH
THE GRILLING?

45
00:02:32,361 --> 00:02:34,112
I KNOW YOU TWO ARE MORE
THAN JUST FRIENDS, EM.

46
00:02:34,196 --> 00:02:35,656
A MOTHER GETS TO ASK.

47
00:02:35,739 --> 00:02:37,074
IT'S COOL.

48
00:02:37,908 --> 00:02:39,159
WELL, JAY IS HOOKING ME UP
WITH HIS BOSS.

49
00:02:39,243 --> 00:02:41,495
APPARENTLY THEY NEED
A NEW MECHANIC.

50
00:02:41,578 --> 00:02:42,329
SIMPSON:
WHAT ABOUT SCHOOL?

51
00:02:42,412 --> 00:02:44,915
HAVE YOU GIVEN ANY THOUGHT ABOUT
TO COMING BACK TO DEGRASSI?

52
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:46,250
I GOT EXPELLED.

53
00:02:47,668 --> 00:02:50,295
WELL, MAYBE I COULD
TALK TO HER.

54
00:02:50,379 --> 00:02:51,380
NO.

55
00:02:51,463 --> 00:02:53,257
I MEAN,
NO THANK YOU.

56
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:55,425
I REALLY DON'T WANNA SET FOOT
IN THAT PLACE AGAIN.

57
00:02:55,509 --> 00:02:59,179
TELL THEM ABOUT
CAMERON'S CUSTOM CARS.

58
00:02:59,972 --> 00:03:02,307
SOME DAY I WANT TO OPEN UP
MY OWN SHOP.

59
00:03:02,391 --> 00:03:03,475
SIMPSON:
WELL THAT SOUNDS LIKE
A FINE PLAN,

60
00:03:03,559 --> 00:03:04,852
IF YOU CAN FIND
A BANK MANAGER

61
00:03:04,935 --> 00:03:07,187
WHO'S WILLING TO LEND MONEY
TO A HIGH SCHOOL DROPOUT.

62
00:03:07,271 --> 00:03:08,981
COUPLE THAT
WITH YOUR RECORD...

63
00:03:09,064 --> 00:03:09,565
EMMA:
MOM?

64
00:03:09,648 --> 00:03:12,234
IT'S HIS FIRST DAY OUT OF JAIL.
CAN YOU GO EASY, PLEASE?

65
00:03:12,317 --> 00:03:14,236
SPIKE:
SORRY.

66
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:16,029
WE'RE REALLY GLAD
YOU'RE HERE, SEAN.

67
00:03:16,113 --> 00:03:17,155
SIMPSON:
AND WE'RE SURE YOU'RE GOING
TO FIGURE IT ALL OUT -

68
00:03:17,239 --> 00:03:18,365
YOUR LIFE, I MEAN.

69
00:03:18,448 --> 00:03:20,951
YOU'VE GOT LOTS OF TIME
FOR THAT.

70
00:03:36,508 --> 00:03:36,842
HEY!

71
00:03:38,802 --> 00:03:40,721
HOW MANY TIMES
HAVE I TOLD YOU GUYS?

72
00:03:40,804 --> 00:03:43,307
NO RUNNING IN THE HALLS!

73
00:03:43,807 --> 00:03:45,100
BOTH:
SORRY, MR. PERINO.

74
00:03:45,184 --> 00:03:46,310
PERINO:
SORRY?

75
00:03:46,393 --> 00:03:48,228
LOOK AT ME,
LOOK AT MY SHOES!

76
00:03:48,312 --> 00:03:50,063
THEY'RE RUINED!

77
00:03:50,564 --> 00:03:52,816
(UNDER HIS BREATH)
SO BUY SOME NEW ONES.

78
00:03:54,943 --> 00:03:56,236
ARE YOU SURE YOU WANT
TO USE THAT TONE

79
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,696
WITH YOUR TEACHER?

80
00:03:57,779 --> 00:04:01,909
BELIEVE ME, YOU DON'T WANT ME
TO MAKE YOUR LIVES DIFFICULT.

81
00:04:01,992 --> 00:04:03,619
GUYS, GO GET THE MOP
FROM THE JANITOR

82
00:04:03,702 --> 00:04:04,703
AND CLEAN THIS MESS UP.

83
00:04:04,786 --> 00:04:06,288
CAPICHE?
GO!

84
00:04:08,207 --> 00:04:10,083
PERINO:
SMART-ASSES,
YOU KNOW?

85
00:04:10,167 --> 00:04:11,668
DRIVE ME CRAZY.

86
00:04:11,752 --> 00:04:15,631
JUST TRY TO REMEMBER,
THEY'RE JUST KIDS.

87
00:04:15,714 --> 00:04:17,174
RIGHT, DOM?

88
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:17,591
DOM?

89
00:04:22,012 --> 00:04:23,305
ENGINE RUNS ON?

90
00:04:23,388 --> 00:04:24,848
IT'S A LOOSE TIMING CHAIN.

91
00:04:24,932 --> 00:04:27,351
SHIMMY IN
THE STEERING...

92
00:04:28,519 --> 00:04:29,728
YOU KNOW HOW TO FIX IT?

93
00:04:29,811 --> 00:04:31,772
YEAH. YOU MACHINE
THE FRONT ROTORS.

94
00:04:31,855 --> 00:04:33,941
JAY WAS RIGHT,
YOU KNOW CARS.

95
00:04:34,024 --> 00:04:35,442
SEAN:
CARS ARE MY LIFE.

96
00:04:35,526 --> 00:04:37,110
YOU KNOW, IF YOU KNOW
HOW THEY WORK,

97
00:04:37,194 --> 00:04:38,946
THEY NEVER LET YOU DOWN.

98
00:04:39,029 --> 00:04:41,615
SPOKEN LIKE
A TRUE MECHANIC.

99
00:04:41,698 --> 00:04:42,533
TELL YOU WHAT,

100
00:04:42,616 --> 00:04:44,576
WE'VE GOT A LEXUS
WITH A FAULTY AC.

101
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:46,036
GO TO WORK!

102
00:04:47,371 --> 00:04:49,665
YOU, YOU MEAN I GOT IT?
I GOT THE JOB?

103
00:04:49,748 --> 00:04:53,836
AND NOT FOR LONG,
IF YOU DON'T GET TO WORK.

104
00:04:54,628 --> 00:04:55,295
YES SIR!

105
00:04:57,464 --> 00:04:57,798
WOO!

106
00:04:58,715 --> 00:04:59,842
I GOT IT, MAN!

107
00:04:59,925 --> 00:05:01,844
WHAT DID I TELL YA?

108
00:05:01,927 --> 00:05:03,470
AFTER YEARS OF FIGHTING,

109
00:05:03,554 --> 00:05:04,471
THE SECOND WORLD WAR
CAME TO AN END

110
00:05:04,555 --> 00:05:06,473
WITH THE BOMBING OF HIROSHIMA.

111
00:05:06,557 --> 00:05:08,225
ONCE THE THIRD RAKE
FINALLY SURRENDERED,

112
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:09,476
THE IRON CURTAIN
DIVIDED EUROPE-

113
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:12,020
I THINK IT'S TIME THIS
PRESENTATION SURRENDERED.

114
00:05:12,104 --> 00:05:14,565
AND BY THE WAY,
IT'S REICH NOT RAKE.

115
00:05:14,648 --> 00:05:15,274
YOU'RE DONE.

116
00:05:15,732 --> 00:05:17,317
BUT YOU CUT ME OFF.

117
00:05:17,401 --> 00:05:19,069
THE ASSIGNMENT WAS
TO SUMMARIZE AN EVENT

118
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:19,778
IN YOUR OWN WORDS;

119
00:05:19,862 --> 00:05:20,404
NOT BORE EVERYONE

120
00:05:20,487 --> 00:05:22,906
BY COPYING THE DAMN THING
FROM YOUR TEXT BOOK.

121
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:24,867
IT'S NOT MY FAULT
HISTORY'S SO BORING.

122
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:25,993
PERINO:
WELL, IT MIGHT BE TO YOU,

123
00:05:26,076 --> 00:05:26,869
BUT I'LL ASSURE YOU,

124
00:05:26,952 --> 00:05:30,163
HISTORY'S A FASCINATING
DISCIPLINE.

125
00:05:30,247 --> 00:05:31,248
MAYBE IT'S THE TEACHER.

126
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,208
WHO SAID-
WHO SAID THAT?!

127
00:05:34,668 --> 00:05:36,461
MR. HAIG?
YOU GOT SOMETHING TO SAY?

128
00:05:36,545 --> 00:05:39,715
DON'T BE A CLOWN:
BE A MAN AND SAY IT.

129
00:05:40,716 --> 00:05:41,758
OKAY, I WILL.

130
00:05:42,426 --> 00:05:44,011
CAN'T YOU CUT DANNY
A BREAK?

131
00:05:44,094 --> 00:05:45,762
I MEAN,
HE'S TRYING HIS BEST.

132
00:05:45,846 --> 00:05:47,514
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT?

133
00:05:47,598 --> 00:05:50,350
INSTEAD OF GIVING DANIEL
A ZERO FOR PLAGIARISM,

134
00:05:50,434 --> 00:05:51,685
DETENTION - BOTH OF YOU.

135
00:05:51,768 --> 00:05:52,436
AND TOMORROW?

136
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:55,189
I'LL LET YOU HELP HIM
REDO HIS PRESENTATION.

137
00:06:11,663 --> 00:06:12,748
HEY GORGEOUS.

138
00:06:12,831 --> 00:06:14,499
HOW DID YOU DO THAT?

139
00:06:14,583 --> 00:06:15,667
YOU'RE A LOUSY SNEAKER.

140
00:06:15,751 --> 00:06:18,587
AND EVERY CAR HAS
AT LEAST THREE MIRRORS.

141
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:19,963
MWAH!

142
00:06:20,714 --> 00:06:21,215
BASED ON THE FACT

143
00:06:21,298 --> 00:06:22,716
THAT YOUR FRESHLY PRESSED
WHITE SHIRT

144
00:06:22,799 --> 00:06:24,218
IS NOW FORGOTTEN
ON THE TOOL BENCH,

145
00:06:24,301 --> 00:06:25,385
YOU GOT THE JOB?

146
00:06:25,469 --> 00:06:27,054
YOUR LITTLE PEP TALK
HELPED.

147
00:06:27,137 --> 00:06:27,721
THANKS.

148
00:06:29,473 --> 00:06:31,266
AND A BIG SHOUT OUT TO JAY,

149
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:33,936
WHO TOTALLY WENT TO THE MAT
FOR HIS BUD, HUH?

150
00:06:34,019 --> 00:06:35,395
MY BEST FRIEND
AND MY GIRLFRIEND:

151
00:06:35,479 --> 00:06:36,813
THE ONLY TWO PEOPLE
I CAN COUNT ON.

152
00:06:36,897 --> 00:06:37,356
GIRLFRIEND?

153
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:39,316
OH, I GUESS NOT EVEN
JAIL TIME

154
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:40,984
CAN KEEP YOU TWO LOVEBIRDS
APART, HUH?

155
00:06:41,985 --> 00:06:42,986
SEAN:
WE SHOULD ALL HANG OUT,
HUH?

156
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:44,988
CATCH UP ON OLD TIMES?

157
00:06:45,072 --> 00:06:48,450
YEAH, SEAN'S NOT CAUGHT UP
ON OLD TIMES.

158
00:06:48,534 --> 00:06:50,536
OLD TIMES ARE OVERRATED.

159
00:06:53,539 --> 00:06:55,415
SEAN:
ALL RIGHT, WELL UM..

160
00:06:55,499 --> 00:06:57,459
WELL, I'M ALL DONE HERE.

161
00:06:57,543 --> 00:06:59,586
WHY DON'T I TAKE MY GIRL
OUT FOR DINNER?

162
00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:00,546
GO, HAVE FUN.

163
00:07:00,629 --> 00:07:01,839
I'LL LOCK UP.

164
00:07:07,553 --> 00:07:08,679
DETENTION ROCKS!

165
00:07:08,762 --> 00:07:10,597
I'D TAKE IT OVER
HISTORY CLASS ANY DAY.

166
00:07:10,681 --> 00:07:12,933
PLUS WE GOT PERINO OFF
OUR BACKS FOR NOW.

167
00:07:13,016 --> 00:07:13,642
HEY, LATER.

168
00:07:13,725 --> 00:07:14,726
LATER...

169
00:07:31,869 --> 00:07:33,287
HEY, MR. PERINO.

170
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:34,371
DEREK.

171
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:37,291
SOMETHING WRONG
WITH YOUR CAR?

172
00:07:37,374 --> 00:07:39,459
WHY? DID YOU DO
SOMETHING TO IT?

173
00:07:39,543 --> 00:07:41,712
NO. I JUST THOUGHT...
BUS STOP.

174
00:07:41,795 --> 00:07:43,255
WHAT, NO FUNNY JOKES?

175
00:07:43,338 --> 00:07:46,842
NOT MUCH OF A COMEDIAN
OUTSIDE OF CLASS, ARE YOU?

176
00:07:46,925 --> 00:07:48,635
I'M SORRY.

177
00:07:48,719 --> 00:07:52,306
DON'T PULL THAT
INNOCENT ACT WITH ME.

178
00:07:54,641 --> 00:07:58,145
UH, UH... I THINK
I'M GONNA WALK HOME.

179
00:07:58,729 --> 00:08:00,647
LET ME MAKE MYSELF CLEAR:

180
00:08:00,731 --> 00:08:02,441
SHOW ME SOME RESPECT

181
00:08:02,524 --> 00:08:05,152
OR WE'VE GOT
A SERIOUS PROBLEM.

182
00:08:05,235 --> 00:08:06,653
UNDERSTOOD?

183
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:21,376
WHERE IS MY LUCKY BRA?

184
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:23,170
THE ONE THAT GIVES ME
MANNY BOOBS.

185
00:08:23,253 --> 00:08:23,795
MANNY:
WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL?

186
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:25,672
YOU'RE JUST GOING ON A DATE
WITH SEAN.

187
00:08:25,756 --> 00:08:26,840
EMMA:
IT'S NOT A DATE.

188
00:08:26,924 --> 00:08:28,008
IT'S THE DATE.

189
00:08:28,091 --> 00:08:29,927
THE HE'S-FINALLY-BACK-
IN-MY-LIFE-

190
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:32,054
AND-EVERYTHING-
HAS-TO-BE-PERFECT DATE.

191
00:08:32,137 --> 00:08:33,972
AND YOU'RE JUST TRYING
TO LIVE UP TO THE PEDESTAL

192
00:08:34,056 --> 00:08:35,724
THAT HE'S PUTTING YOU ON.

193
00:08:35,807 --> 00:08:37,851
THERE IS NOTHING WRONG
WITH HAVING A BOYFRIEND

194
00:08:37,935 --> 00:08:40,187
WHO THINKS YOU'RE AMAZING.

195
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:42,940
MANNY:
UNLIKE THOSE SHOES,

196
00:08:43,023 --> 00:08:44,942
NOBODY'S PERFECT.

197
00:08:46,443 --> 00:08:47,778
LEAST OF ALL ME.

198
00:08:49,947 --> 00:08:51,782
I WENT BY THE GARAGE TODAY
AND JAY WAS THERE.

199
00:08:52,574 --> 00:08:54,493
THREE'S DEFINITELY NOT COMPANY.

200
00:08:54,576 --> 00:08:55,827
EMMA:
JAY IS SEAN'S BEST FRIEND.

201
00:08:55,911 --> 00:08:58,455
HOW DO I EVEN BEGIN
TO TELL HIM...

202
00:08:58,539 --> 00:09:02,751
WHAT I DID WITH...JAY
IN THE RAVINE.

203
00:09:02,835 --> 00:09:04,962
MANNY:
YOU WERE SINGLE.
IT WAS A CRAZY TIME.

204
00:09:05,045 --> 00:09:08,382
WHAT WERE YOU SUPPOSED TO DO?
SIT HOME AND KNIT?

205
00:09:08,465 --> 00:09:10,592
I'M NOT SURE THAT SEAN'S
GONNA SEE IT THAT WAY.

206
00:09:10,676 --> 00:09:13,971
IF HE REALLY LOVES YOU,
THEN HE SHOULD.

207
00:09:18,809 --> 00:09:22,187
SPINNER:
OKAY, I WILL BE BACK
IN AN HOUR TO LOCK-UP.

208
00:09:22,271 --> 00:09:24,273
DON'T BREAK ANYTHING.

209
00:09:24,356 --> 00:09:25,649
WE WON'T.

210
00:09:26,483 --> 00:09:27,985
THANKS, MAN.

211
00:09:34,199 --> 00:09:35,033
IT'S NOT MUCH,

212
00:09:35,117 --> 00:09:37,744
BUT JAIL DOES A NUMBER
ON A GUY'S SAVINGS.

213
00:09:37,828 --> 00:09:40,581
THE PLACE,
THE CANDLES,

214
00:09:40,664 --> 00:09:42,583
THE TOFURKEY -

215
00:09:42,666 --> 00:09:45,002
EVERYTHING IS PERFECT.

216
00:09:46,545 --> 00:09:48,213
IT IS PERFECT.

217
00:09:49,173 --> 00:09:50,924
YOU'RE PERFECT.

218
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:54,845
I'VE STILL MADE MISTAKES.

219
00:09:56,555 --> 00:09:59,933
YOU'RE TALKING
TO THE MASTER OF MISTAKES.

220
00:10:00,017 --> 00:10:02,060
SO YOU WON'T HOLD THEM
AGAINST ME?

221
00:10:02,144 --> 00:10:03,312
OF COURSE NOT.

222
00:10:05,189 --> 00:10:05,522
WHY?

223
00:10:06,231 --> 00:10:08,942
IS THERE SOMETHING YOU NEED
TO TELL ME ABOUT?

224
00:10:09,026 --> 00:10:10,360
NO. IT'S JUST...

225
00:10:12,696 --> 00:10:13,322
STUPID.

226
00:10:14,239 --> 00:10:16,950
NOTHING YOU SAY IS STUPID,
EM.

227
00:10:17,034 --> 00:10:19,077
YOU'RE THE SMARTEST PERSON
I KNOW.

228
00:10:26,543 --> 00:10:27,920
HEY, LAST NIGHT,

229
00:10:28,003 --> 00:10:30,672
I THOUGHT EMMA
WAS DROPPING HINTS.

230
00:10:30,756 --> 00:10:33,133
DID SOMETHING HAPPEN?

231
00:10:33,217 --> 00:10:35,928
NAH.
IT'S PROBABLY NOTHING.

232
00:10:37,054 --> 00:10:38,889
IF THERE WAS SOMETHING,
YOU'D TELL ME, RIGHT?

233
00:10:40,933 --> 00:10:41,767
NO. FORGET IT.

234
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:44,645
YOU'RE NOT HEARING IT
FROM ME.

235
00:10:44,728 --> 00:10:46,313
JAY, COME ON.

236
00:10:46,396 --> 00:10:48,565
AFTER EVERYTHING
I'VE BEEN THROUGH?

237
00:10:48,649 --> 00:10:50,484
I CAN HANDLE IT.

238
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:54,821
FINE,
BUT I WARNED YOU.

239
00:10:54,905 --> 00:10:57,407
ALL RIGHT,
WHILE YOU WERE GONE,

240
00:10:57,491 --> 00:11:00,577
EM AND I KIND OF...
FOOLED AROUND.

241
00:11:03,205 --> 00:11:03,747
YOU HAD SEX?

242
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:05,207
NO! NO, NO, NO.

243
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:07,376
I MEAN,
NOT REALLY.

244
00:11:08,001 --> 00:11:09,503
IT DEPENDS HOW
YOU LOOK AT IT.

245
00:11:09,586 --> 00:11:11,338
I HAD MORE
THAN SHE DID.

246
00:11:11,421 --> 00:11:12,965
I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS!

247
00:11:13,048 --> 00:11:13,757
YOU AND EMMA?

248
00:11:13,841 --> 00:11:15,050
DUDE, DON'T OVERREACT.

249
00:11:15,133 --> 00:11:17,052
LOOK, YOU'D JUST BROKEN UP
WITH ELLIE...

250
00:11:17,135 --> 00:11:20,681
YOU AND EMMA HADN'T BEEN
A THING FOR LIKE YEARS.

251
00:11:20,764 --> 00:11:22,683
IT JUST KIND OF HAPPENED.
ONCE.

252
00:11:25,686 --> 00:11:26,979
YOU SAID YOU COULD TAKE IT.

253
00:11:27,062 --> 00:11:29,356
JUST SHUT UP, OKAY?
SHUT UP!

254
00:11:29,439 --> 00:11:30,691
MAN, I'M SORRY.

255
00:11:32,109 --> 00:11:33,402
I SAID SHUT UP!

256
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:45,747
SEAN...

257
00:11:46,707 --> 00:11:48,250
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
SHOULDN'T YOU BE AT WORK?

258
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:49,960
NEVER MIND.

259
00:11:50,043 --> 00:11:50,377
DID...

260
00:11:52,629 --> 00:11:55,924
DID YOU AND JAY
HAVE A THING LAST YEAR?

261
00:11:58,093 --> 00:11:59,928
WHO TOLD YOU THAT?

262
00:12:00,012 --> 00:12:01,013
WRONG ANSWER.

263
00:12:02,472 --> 00:12:04,683
SEAN,
IT WAS TWO YEARS AGO,

264
00:12:04,766 --> 00:12:06,894
RIGHT AFTER I HAD A GUN
POINTED AT MY FACE.

265
00:12:06,977 --> 00:12:08,103
TO SAY THAT I WAS
SUPER-DUPER MESSED UP

266
00:12:08,187 --> 00:12:09,396
WOULD BE AN UNDERSTATEMENT.

267
00:12:09,479 --> 00:12:11,315
HOW COULD YOU DO THAT?

268
00:12:11,815 --> 00:12:12,900
AND WITH JAY?

269
00:12:13,734 --> 00:12:15,319
THE THOUGHT OF YOU TWO TOGETHER
MAKES ME WANT TO-

270
00:12:15,402 --> 00:12:19,323
WHAT HAPPENED TO "I WON'T
HOLD IT AGAINST YOU"?

271
00:12:22,993 --> 00:12:24,328
LOVER'S QUARREL?

272
00:12:35,088 --> 00:12:36,381
I TAKE IT
WE'RE NOT COOL.

273
00:12:36,465 --> 00:12:38,467
DON'T TALK TO ME.

274
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:40,219
HEY, GET ON THE LEXUS.

275
00:12:40,302 --> 00:12:43,347
MR. LEYTON
IS MY BEST CUSTOMER.

276
00:12:48,310 --> 00:12:50,062
UH, YOU WANT TO HAND ME
THAT RATCHET?

277
00:12:50,145 --> 00:12:52,105
GET IT YOURSELF.

278
00:12:52,189 --> 00:12:53,607
LOOK, IT WAS OVER
A YEAR AGO, MAN.

279
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:55,526
JUST LET IT GO.

280
00:12:55,609 --> 00:12:56,151
LET IT GO?

281
00:12:56,235 --> 00:12:58,904
I'M NOT GONNA LET IT GO,
ALL RIGHT?

282
00:12:58,987 --> 00:12:59,988
YOU TOOK SOMETHING
THAT WAS GOOD

283
00:13:00,072 --> 00:13:01,198
AND YOU RUINED IT.

284
00:13:01,281 --> 00:13:02,407
JUST LIKE YOU ALWAYS DO.

285
00:13:02,491 --> 00:13:04,201
RIGHT, RIGHT,
MAKE ME THE BAD GUY.

286
00:13:04,284 --> 00:13:07,412
ALL RIGHT, WHATEVER HELPS
YOU SLEEP AT NIGHT.

287
00:13:07,496 --> 00:13:09,581
YOU DIDN'T CARE ABOUT EMMA.
YOU USED HER.

288
00:13:09,665 --> 00:13:10,582
YOU TOOK ADVANTAGE
OF HER.

289
00:13:10,666 --> 00:13:12,584
I DIDN'T TAKE ADVANTAGE
OF ANYBODY.

290
00:13:12,668 --> 00:13:15,504
THE TRUTH IS,
SHE CHASED ME, DUDE.

291
00:13:15,587 --> 00:13:19,508
SHE DAMN NEAR BEGGED ME
TO LET HER DO IT.

292
00:13:19,591 --> 00:13:21,176
(FIGHTING GRUNTS)

293
00:13:21,635 --> 00:13:23,595
(LOUD THUD,
TOOLS CLATTER)

294
00:13:32,271 --> 00:13:34,273
SO EACH GROUP IS NOW HOLDING
A DIFFERENT PART

295
00:13:34,356 --> 00:13:35,899
OF THE HUMAN BODY.

296
00:13:35,983 --> 00:13:38,527
I WANT YOU TO EXPLAIN
IN ESSAY FORM,

297
00:13:38,610 --> 00:13:40,112
THE FUNCTION OF YOUR PART.

298
00:13:42,281 --> 00:13:45,200
WELL,
THIS SHOULD BE EASY.

299
00:13:46,201 --> 00:13:47,202
EM!

300
00:13:47,286 --> 00:13:48,662
YOU'RE KILLING
JOHNNY CARCASS MAN.

301
00:13:48,745 --> 00:13:50,789
HIS HEART'S NOT GONNA WORK
WITH A PENCIL IN IT!

302
00:13:50,873 --> 00:13:51,415
I'M SORRY.

303
00:13:51,498 --> 00:13:54,084
I WAS IMAGINING
IT BELONGS TO SEAN,

304
00:13:54,168 --> 00:13:55,794
WHO FOUND OUT ABOUT
ME AND JAY,

305
00:13:55,878 --> 00:13:57,921
FROM JAY.

306
00:13:58,005 --> 00:13:58,589
OUCH.

307
00:13:58,672 --> 00:13:59,590
HOPE YOU HAD
A SOFT LANDING

308
00:13:59,673 --> 00:14:02,843
WHEN YOU FELL OFF
THAT PEDESTAL.

309
00:14:05,387 --> 00:14:07,556
EASY, CUCKOO-BANANAS!

310
00:14:09,766 --> 00:14:11,268
THIS IS ONE
OF THE FEW CLASSES

311
00:14:11,351 --> 00:14:13,604
THAT I'M NOT FAILING.

312
00:14:14,771 --> 00:14:15,564
WHAT IS IT WITH GUYS

313
00:14:15,647 --> 00:14:18,066
AND THEIR RIDICULOUS
DOUBLE STANDARDS?

314
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:19,151
THEY CAN DO WHATEVER
THEY WANT,

315
00:14:19,234 --> 00:14:20,652
BUT A GIRL MAKES
ONE MISTAKE

316
00:14:20,736 --> 00:14:23,238
AND HER REP
IS TARNISHED FOR LIFE!

317
00:14:23,322 --> 00:14:24,740
LOOK, I KNOW YOUR
LITTLE VISIT

318
00:14:24,823 --> 00:14:25,574
WITH JAY IN THE RAVINE

319
00:14:25,657 --> 00:14:27,951
MAY NOT HAVE BEEN ON
THE EMMA NELSON HIGHLIGHT REEL,

320
00:14:28,035 --> 00:14:30,996
BUT NO GUY HAS THE RIGHT
TO JUDGE YOU,

321
00:14:31,079 --> 00:14:32,915
ESPECIALLY SEAN.

322
00:14:38,712 --> 00:14:41,548
DEREK, CAN I TALK TO YOU
A MINUTE?

323
00:14:47,137 --> 00:14:47,804
LOOK, I JUST WANT
TO MAKE SURE

324
00:14:47,888 --> 00:14:50,557
THERE'S NO MISUNDERSTANDING
ABOUT LAST NIGHT.

325
00:14:50,641 --> 00:14:53,852
WELL, WHAT YOU SAID,
MR. PERINO,

326
00:14:53,936 --> 00:14:56,605
IT WAS KINDA THREATENING.

327
00:14:56,688 --> 00:14:59,358
DEREK,
YOU'RE A SMART KID.

328
00:14:59,942 --> 00:15:03,195
I HATE SEEING YOU
WASTE YOUR POTENTIAL.

329
00:15:03,278 --> 00:15:05,489
I WAS JUST TRYING
TO MOTIVATE YOU.

330
00:15:05,572 --> 00:15:07,491
MORE LIKE YOU
FREAKED ME OUT.

331
00:15:07,574 --> 00:15:08,325
LOOK, WHAT DO YOU SAY

332
00:15:08,408 --> 00:15:10,494
WE JUST FORGET
IT EVEN HAPPENED?

333
00:15:13,163 --> 00:15:14,831
YEAH, I GUESS.

334
00:15:17,459 --> 00:15:18,710
OKAY.

335
00:15:18,794 --> 00:15:20,712
LOOK, GO IN THERE,

336
00:15:20,796 --> 00:15:25,050
AND KNOCK THAT PRESENTATION
OUTTA THE PARK, OKAY?

337
00:15:31,390 --> 00:15:33,225
YOU REMEMBERED
TO CHANGE THE OIL?

338
00:15:33,308 --> 00:15:34,142
THERE'S AN OIL CHANGE
CHARGE ON THE BILL,

339
00:15:34,226 --> 00:15:35,727
ISN'T THERE?

340
00:15:37,145 --> 00:15:39,231
I'VE NOTICED A BIT
OF PULLING LATELY.

341
00:15:39,314 --> 00:15:41,900
HOW IS THE TIRE PRESSURE?

342
00:15:44,319 --> 00:15:46,113
SEEMS FINE TO ME.

343
00:15:46,196 --> 00:15:47,698
MAYBE I SHOULD TALK
TO YOUR BOSS.

344
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:51,785
IF YOU HAVE A PROBLEM
WITH MY WORK,

345
00:15:51,869 --> 00:15:53,328
THEN YOU TAKE IT UP
WITH ME.

346
00:15:53,412 --> 00:15:56,039
SO, DO WE HAVE
A PROBLEM?

347
00:15:56,123 --> 00:15:59,376
I HAVE A MECHANIC
WITH AN ATTITUDE.

348
00:15:59,459 --> 00:16:01,044
HEY, SEAN,
BACK OFF!

349
00:16:04,381 --> 00:16:05,174
LOOK, I'M SORRY,
SIR.

350
00:16:05,257 --> 00:16:07,176
HIS PROBLEM,
IT'S WITH ME.

351
00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:09,386
TELL TONY I QUIT.

352
00:16:15,934 --> 00:16:18,353
AND IN LATE OCTOBER,
1945,

353
00:16:18,437 --> 00:16:20,272
THE UNITED NATIONS
WAS FORMED.

354
00:16:20,355 --> 00:16:21,356
TO PROMOTE HUMAN RIGHTS

355
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,567
AND PREVENT FUTURE
WORLD WARS.

356
00:16:25,569 --> 00:16:27,070
NICE JOB, YOU TWO.

357
00:16:27,988 --> 00:16:30,240
OKAY, WHO'S MY NEXT VICTIM?

358
00:16:31,033 --> 00:16:33,118
JACKSON, YOU READY?

359
00:16:34,703 --> 00:16:36,413
BLANK STARE.
FIGURES.

360
00:16:37,039 --> 00:16:39,416
DID ANYBODY NOT STAY UP
ALL NIGHT PLAYING VIDEO GAMES

361
00:16:39,499 --> 00:16:43,295
AND LOOKING AT NUDIE PICTURES
ON THE INTERNET?

362
00:16:43,378 --> 00:16:45,047
TAKE THE ZERO.

363
00:16:47,090 --> 00:16:50,511
WHY DO YOU HAVE
TO BE LIKE THAT, SIR?

364
00:16:50,594 --> 00:16:52,429
DO YOU HAVE A PROBLEM,
MR. HAIG?

365
00:16:56,558 --> 00:16:58,268
I DIDN'T THINK SO.

366
00:16:58,352 --> 00:16:59,853
ALL RIGHT, WHO'S GOING TO
BUTCHER ANOTHER PRESENTATION?

367
00:16:59,937 --> 00:17:03,774
OR DO I HAVE TO KEEP
HANDING OUT ZEROES?

368
00:17:04,441 --> 00:17:05,400
HMMM?

369
00:17:08,403 --> 00:17:10,489
HEY!
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

370
00:17:26,213 --> 00:17:27,506
CLASSIC SEAN.

371
00:17:27,589 --> 00:17:28,423
WHEN THE GOING
GETS TOUGH,

372
00:17:28,507 --> 00:17:30,008
THE SEAN GETS GOING.

373
00:17:30,092 --> 00:17:32,636
NOT MUCH TO STICK
AROUND FOR.

374
00:17:32,719 --> 00:17:34,680
SO THE MINUTE YOU FIND OUT
I'M NOT PERFECT,

375
00:17:34,763 --> 00:17:35,848
YOU RUN AWAY?

376
00:17:35,931 --> 00:17:38,183
NOT PERFECT?
I'D SAY.

377
00:17:38,684 --> 00:17:40,185
WELL, WHAT DO YOU EXPECT,
SEAN?

378
00:17:40,269 --> 00:17:42,271
I'M A REAL PERSON.

379
00:17:42,354 --> 00:17:44,690
IN THREE MONTHS,
I'LL BE OLD ENOUGH TO VOTE,

380
00:17:44,773 --> 00:17:46,233
TO LEGALLY DRINK
IN QUEBEC!

381
00:17:46,316 --> 00:17:47,359
I'M NOT THE GIRL
YOU KNEW

382
00:17:47,442 --> 00:17:49,111
IN GRADE SEVEN
ANY MORE.

383
00:17:49,194 --> 00:17:50,445
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU?

384
00:17:50,529 --> 00:17:51,697
EMMA:
I GREW UP.

385
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:54,032
MAYBE YOU SHOULD TRY IT.

386
00:17:54,116 --> 00:17:56,368
MY PARENTS KICKED ME OUT
WHEN I WAS TWELVE.

387
00:17:56,451 --> 00:17:57,536
ALL RIGHT?
I GREW UP IN A HURRY.

388
00:17:57,619 --> 00:17:59,037
I NEEDED TO,
TO SURVIVE.

389
00:17:59,121 --> 00:18:00,455
ALL YOU DID
WAS BUILD A WALL

390
00:18:00,539 --> 00:18:01,915
BETWEEN YOURSELF
AND THE WORLD

391
00:18:01,999 --> 00:18:03,292
TO HIDE BEHIND.

392
00:18:04,209 --> 00:18:05,878
YOU LET ME DOWN.

393
00:18:05,961 --> 00:18:07,129
MY PARENTS LET ME DOWN.

394
00:18:07,212 --> 00:18:08,839
SCHOOL SYSTEM LET ME DOWN.

395
00:18:08,922 --> 00:18:10,507
I'M JUST SAVING MYSELF
FROM MORE.

396
00:18:10,591 --> 00:18:12,217
SO ALL YOUR PROBLEMS
ARE SOMEONE ELSE'S FAULT,

397
00:18:12,301 --> 00:18:12,801
RIGHT?

398
00:18:13,427 --> 00:18:15,220
IT'S NOT MY FAULT
YOU DID THAT TO JAY.

399
00:18:15,304 --> 00:18:17,514
AND YOU'LL NEVER LET ME
FORGET IT, WILL YOU?

400
00:18:22,394 --> 00:18:23,979
OKAY, LITTLE BOY,
I GIVE UP.

401
00:18:28,066 --> 00:18:31,361
(UNINTELLIGIBLE ANNOUNCEMENTS
OVER BUS STATION P.A. SYSTEM)

402
00:19:14,738 --> 00:19:15,405
DID HE GET FIRED?

403
00:19:15,489 --> 00:19:16,740
NO, BUT UH...

404
00:19:16,823 --> 00:19:20,327
MS. HATZILAKOS IS LAUNCHING
AN INVESTIGATION.

405
00:19:20,410 --> 00:19:21,453
I SHOULD'VE KEPT
MY MOUTH SHUT.

406
00:19:21,537 --> 00:19:25,082
NO. YOU DID THE RIGHT THING,
DEREK.

407
00:19:25,165 --> 00:19:28,168
READY TO GIVE YOUR SIDE
OF THE STORY?

408
00:19:28,252 --> 00:19:30,671
IS IT OKAY
IF I'M A LITTLE SCARED?

409
00:19:30,754 --> 00:19:31,839
DON'T BE, OKAY?

410
00:19:31,922 --> 00:19:34,007
I'LL BE IN THERE
WITH YOU.

411
00:19:34,091 --> 00:19:34,758
COME ON.

412
00:19:57,114 --> 00:20:00,450
THIS ISN'T SUPPOSED
TO HAPPEN.

413
00:20:00,534 --> 00:20:03,954
IT DIDN'T HAVE TO.
BUT YOU MADE IT.

414
00:20:05,956 --> 00:20:10,127
WHEN I CAME BACK HERE
FROM WASAGA, EMMA,

415
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:14,214
IT WASN'T FOR SCHOOL
OR TO OPEN A GARAGE.

416
00:20:15,507 --> 00:20:17,509
IT WAS NONE OF THAT.

417
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:22,723
THE FUNNY THING IS,
YOU GOT WHAT YOU CAME FOR.

418
00:20:22,806 --> 00:20:24,766
THEN YOU BLEW IT.

419
00:20:32,649 --> 00:20:34,318
DON'T GIVE UP ON ME.

420
00:20:36,153 --> 00:20:36,778
PLEASE.

421
00:20:38,155 --> 00:20:40,532
I CAN'T BE PERFECT,
SEAN.

422
00:20:40,616 --> 00:20:43,243
I CAN'T BE EVERYTHING
YOU NEED ALL THE TIME.

423
00:20:43,327 --> 00:20:43,744
GOOD.

424
00:20:44,995 --> 00:20:47,539
I WANT YOU TO CHALLENGE ME.

425
00:20:47,623 --> 00:20:50,125
I WANT YOU TO CALL ME
ON MY CRAP.

426
00:20:50,209 --> 00:20:50,626
SURE.

427
00:20:52,294 --> 00:20:54,588
BUT IF WE'RE GOING TO HAVE
A REAL RELATIONSHIP,

428
00:20:54,671 --> 00:20:57,758
YOU NEED TO SAVE YOURSELF
FROM YOURSELF SOMETIMES.

429
00:21:05,974 --> 00:21:08,352
I'LL ASK TONY
FOR MY JOB BACK.

430
00:21:09,770 --> 00:21:13,524
OKAY, I'LL GET
MY HIGH SCHOOL EQUIVALENCY.

431
00:21:13,607 --> 00:21:16,610
I'LL START LOOKING
FOR MY OWN PLACE.

432
00:21:21,365 --> 00:21:22,866
AND WHAT ABOUT US?

433
00:21:32,626 --> 00:21:35,712
I WANT TO GET TO KNOW
YOU AGAIN, EM.
