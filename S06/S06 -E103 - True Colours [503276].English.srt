00:00:08,675 --> 00:00:10,177
MR. STONE:
I REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR TIME,
CHUCK.

2
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:12,095
I'M GLAD WE SEE EYE TO EYE
ON THIS.

3
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:15,015
CROWN ATTORNEY:
WELL LOOK, I'VE KNOWN PETER
SINCE HE WAS A BOY.

4
00:00:15,098 --> 00:00:16,183
HE'S A GOOD KID.

5
00:00:16,266 --> 00:00:18,602
HE JUST GOT MIXED UP
WITH THE WRONG ELEMENT.

6
00:00:18,685 --> 00:00:20,354
MAN, DID I EVER.

7
00:00:20,437 --> 00:00:23,524
I TRULY REGRET THE DAY
THAT I MET SEAN CAMERON.

8
00:00:23,607 --> 00:00:24,775
WELL, THANKFULLY,

9
00:00:24,858 --> 00:00:27,027
WE WON'T HAVE TO WORRY
ABOUT SEEING SEAN AGAIN.

10
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:28,028
PETER:
OH, MOM? DAD?

11
00:00:28,111 --> 00:00:29,488
DO YOU MIND IF I GO TALK
TO EMMA FOR A MINUTE?

12
00:00:30,989 --> 00:00:32,282
GO AHEAD.

13
00:00:34,326 --> 00:00:36,703
EMMA:
WHAT HAPPENED?
I'M DYING!

14
00:00:36,787 --> 00:00:37,746
WELL, THE CROWN ATTORNEY'S
BEEN GOING

15
00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:39,414
TO MY DAD'S CHRISTMAS PARTY
FOR YEARS,

16
00:00:39,498 --> 00:00:41,208
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED.

17
00:00:41,291 --> 00:00:44,044
I'M FREE, EMMA.
I'M FREE.

18
00:00:44,127 --> 00:00:45,045
MY DAD JUST PULLED
SOME STRINGS

19
00:00:45,128 --> 00:00:46,463
WITH HIS BUDDY CHUCK.

20
00:00:46,547 --> 00:00:48,423
SO YOU GOT OFF
WITH NOTHING?

21
00:00:48,507 --> 00:00:49,216
HARDLY.

22
00:00:49,299 --> 00:00:51,009
NO, I LOST MY LICENSE,

23
00:00:51,093 --> 00:00:53,262
I'VE GOT TONS
OF COMMUNITY SERVICE,

24
00:00:53,345 --> 00:00:55,430
AND I'M UNDER STRICT HOUSE
ARREST AT MY MOM'S.

25
00:00:55,514 --> 00:00:58,183
OUCH.
THAT'LL BE NO PICNIC.

26
00:00:58,267 --> 00:00:59,560
YEAH,
TELL ME ABOUT IT.

27
00:00:59,643 --> 00:01:00,561
THERE'S GOOD NEWS.

28
00:01:00,644 --> 00:01:04,606
SOUNDS LIKE SEAN IS GONNA BE
NAILED TO THE WALL FOR THIS.

29
00:01:04,690 --> 00:01:06,733
I HAVE A NEW ZERO
TOLERANCE POLICY

30
00:01:06,817 --> 00:01:10,237
WHEN IT COMES TO
TALKING ABOUT SEAN.

31
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:11,363
SO YOU HAVEN'T HEARD
FROM HIM?

32
00:01:11,446 --> 00:01:12,364
NOPE.

33
00:01:12,447 --> 00:01:13,240
WITH HIS HIT
AND RUN CHARGES,

34
00:01:13,323 --> 00:01:16,410
I DON'T THINK EITHER OF US WILL
FOR A LONG, LONG TIME.

PETER:
ILLEGAL STREET RACING

39
00:02:07,044 --> 00:02:08,795
IS LIKE PLAYING
WITH A LOADED GUN.

40
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:10,422
IT'S A SERIOUS CRIME.

41
00:02:10,506 --> 00:02:12,341
SO MY ACTIONS
HAVE HAD REPROCATIONS

42
00:02:12,424 --> 00:02:15,010
BEYOND MY PERSONAL PUNISHMENTS.

43
00:02:15,093 --> 00:02:16,470
AND I HOPE I CAN EXPLAIN
TO EVERYONE

44
00:02:16,553 --> 00:02:18,972
JUST HOW SORRY AND ASHAMED
I FEEL.

45
00:02:19,056 --> 00:02:22,976
MY BEHAVIOUR, AS WELL AS
THE OTHER PEOPLE INVOLVED,

46
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:25,229
HAD TERRIBLE CONSEQUENCES.

47
00:02:25,312 --> 00:02:27,397
I ALSO NEED TO SAY
THAT I'M SORRY

48
00:02:27,481 --> 00:02:30,442
FOR TARNISHING DEGRASSI'S REP
IN OUR COMMUNITY,

49
00:02:30,526 --> 00:02:32,986
AND HOPE THAT I CAN
GAIN YOUR TRUST BACK.

50
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:34,404
THANK YOU.

51
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:41,161
WE'VE SEEN IT FROM C.E.O.'S,
ATHLETES AND PRESIDENTS.

52
00:02:41,245 --> 00:02:43,956
IT'S A CLASSIC EXAMPLE
OF THE ON-AIR "MEA CULPA".

53
00:02:47,292 --> 00:02:48,502
BUT IN THIS CASE,

54
00:02:48,585 --> 00:02:50,254
I'M SURE IT'S COMING FROM
A VERY GENUINE PLACE.

55
00:02:51,463 --> 00:02:53,131
MANNY:
SO PETER GOT OUT OF JAIL

56
00:02:53,215 --> 00:02:55,175
BECAUSE HE SAID
HE WAS SORRY?

57
00:02:55,259 --> 00:02:57,511
AND BECAUSE HE AGREED
TO A ZILLION CONDITIONS.

58
00:02:57,594 --> 00:02:58,846
PETER'S TAKING THIS
SERIOUSLY, MANNY.

59
00:02:58,929 --> 00:02:59,721
IT'S NO JOKE.

60
00:02:59,805 --> 00:03:01,181
YOU'RE RIGHT,
NO ONE'S LAUGHING,

61
00:03:01,265 --> 00:03:02,558
LEAST OF ALL SEAN.

62
00:03:02,641 --> 00:03:03,725
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

63
00:03:03,809 --> 00:03:04,518
NOTHING.

64
00:03:04,601 --> 00:03:05,853
I JUST...
FEEL A LITTLE BAD.

65
00:03:05,936 --> 00:03:07,437
I MEAN, I KNOW THIS
WAS SEAN'S FAULT.

66
00:03:07,521 --> 00:03:09,273
BUT STILL,
HE'S IN JAIL.

67
00:03:09,356 --> 00:03:10,357
SEAN WILL TAKE CARE
OF HIMSELF.

68
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:11,525
HE ALWAYS DOES.

69
00:03:11,608 --> 00:03:13,527
PETER'S THE ONE
I'M WORRIED ABOUT.

70
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:15,028
HEARD MY NAME.

71
00:03:15,112 --> 00:03:16,196
HOPE YOU'RE SAYING
GOOD THINGS.

72
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,239
EMMA:
ONLY.

73
00:03:17,322 --> 00:03:20,826
DON'T WANT TO DISTURB
VISITING HOUR.

74
00:03:21,869 --> 00:03:24,538
SO, HOW'S LIFE
UNDER HOUSE ARREST?

75
00:03:24,621 --> 00:03:26,123
THE WARDEN IS NOT
CUTTING ME ANY SLACK.

76
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:28,250
SHE'S NOT EVEN GONNA LET ME
TAKE YOU TO THE DANCE.

77
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:29,710
WHAT? YOU'RE KIDDING!

78
00:03:29,793 --> 00:03:31,753
THAT IS SO UNFAIR!

79
00:03:35,799 --> 00:03:37,759
YEAH, I'M COMING!

80
00:03:39,303 --> 00:03:41,680
I'LL TALK TO YOU
LATER?

81
00:03:44,808 --> 00:03:46,268
LIBERTY:
SO WE'LL HIRE A MARIACHI BAND.

82
00:03:47,978 --> 00:03:48,729
WHAT?

83
00:03:48,812 --> 00:03:49,855
YOU SAID WE NEEDED A THEME
FOR THE DANCE.

84
00:03:50,647 --> 00:03:51,857
A GOOD THEME.

85
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:53,150
LOOK,
AS THE NEW TREASURER,

86
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:55,235
I'VE DONE THE MATH.
NO BAND.

87
00:03:55,319 --> 00:03:56,528
THE MOST WE CAN AFFORD
RIGHT NOW

88
00:03:56,612 --> 00:03:58,572
IS JIMMY AND SPINNER
JAMMING IN SOMBREROS.

89
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:02,826
EVEN IN DISGUISES
THAT WOULD BE LAME.

90
00:04:06,205 --> 00:04:07,539
WAIT! THAT'S IT!

91
00:04:08,999 --> 00:04:10,792
THAT'LL BE OUR THEME -
A MASQUERADE.

92
00:04:10,876 --> 00:04:12,794
LIKE EVERYONE WILL COME
IN COSTUME,

93
00:04:12,878 --> 00:04:14,046
ALL INCOGNITO.

94
00:04:16,006 --> 00:04:16,840
CUCARACHA!

95
00:04:19,301 --> 00:04:20,844
SPEAKING OF COCKROACHES,

96
00:04:20,928 --> 00:04:21,762
WHAT'S HE DOING HERE?

97
00:04:24,014 --> 00:04:25,933
IF HE'S BACK AT DEGRASSI,
I'M DROPPING OUT.

98
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,198
IT'S NOT HERE.

99
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:42,032

OKAY, NINA,

100
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:43,784

00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:51,124
WHAT HAPPENED TO MY ARTICLE
ON THE TUITION RALLY?

104
00:04:51,208 --> 00:04:53,585
OH, YOU MEAN THE ONE FILLED
WITH ROOKIE REPORTER MISTAKES?

105
00:04:53,669 --> 00:04:55,587
HMM. GUESS I FORGOT
TO PUBLISH IT.

106
00:04:55,671 --> 00:04:56,380
WONDER WHY?

107
00:04:56,463 --> 00:04:58,590
WELL, DON'T I EVEN GET
A CHANCE TO FIX IT?

108
00:04:58,674 --> 00:04:59,633
JESSE:
NO.

109
00:04:59,716 --> 00:05:01,218
AND IF YOU NEED TALKING DOWN,
FROSH?

110
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:02,636
THERE'S A COUNSELLOR
IN THE CLINIC.

111
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,389
(DISBELIEVING)
UGH!

112
00:05:05,806 --> 00:05:08,183
I GAVE UP FOOD AND SLEEP.

113
00:05:08,267 --> 00:05:10,811
I DID RESEARCH
IN A BEER BONG PUDDLE!

114
00:05:10,894 --> 00:05:11,979
NINA:
WELCOME TO THE CORE.

115

116
00:05:18,235 --> 00:05:19,820
THANKS, MR. S.
I APPRECIATE YOUR CONCERN.

117
00:05:19,903 --> 00:05:22,406
I'LL PASS IT ON
TO SEAN.

118
00:05:24,032 --> 00:05:26,326
WHATEVER YOU'RE HERE FOR?
WE'RE NOT INTERESTED.

119
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:28,287
I WAS JUST TALKING
TO YOUR STEP-DAD ABOUT SEAN.

120
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:29,162
REMEMBER HIM?

121
00:05:29,246 --> 00:05:30,455
I'M TRYING TO FORGET.

122
00:05:30,539 --> 00:05:32,165
WELL, SOMEONE'S CHANGED
THEIR TUNE.

123
00:05:32,249 --> 00:05:34,459
SEEMS TO ME SOMEONE WAS
PRETTY DAMN INTERESTED IN SEAN

124
00:05:34,543 --> 00:05:35,377
FOR A WHILE.

125
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:36,837
EXCUSE ME?
WHAT DID HE TELL YOU?

126
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:37,921
NOTHING.

127
00:05:38,005 --> 00:05:38,964
HE DIDN'T HAVE TO.

128
00:05:39,047 --> 00:05:41,341
LOOK, IT WAS OBVIOUS
THERE WAS SOMETHING GOING ON.

129
00:05:41,425 --> 00:05:43,719
SOMETHING THAT YOU DIDN'T WANT
YOUR BOYFRIEND TO KNOW ABOUT.

130
00:05:43,802 --> 00:05:46,805
THIS CONVERSATION IS OVER,
JAY.

131
00:05:46,889 --> 00:05:49,016
SPEAKING ABOUT
YOUR BOYFRIEND,

132
00:05:49,099 --> 00:05:50,851
I HEARD HE GOT OFF
WITH A SLAP ON THE WRIST.

133
00:05:50,934 --> 00:05:53,604
PLEASE! HE'S UNDER MAJOR
HATZILAKOS LOCKDOWN,

134
00:05:53,687 --> 00:05:55,063
PLUS COMMUNITY SERVICE.

135
00:05:55,147 --> 00:05:56,190
POOR BABY.

136
00:05:56,273 --> 00:05:59,526
I REALLY HOPE THE LEAF-BLOWER
DOESN'T STRAIN HIS BACK.

137
00:05:59,610 --> 00:06:00,986
I'M REALLY BEGINNING
TO REMEMBER WHY

138
00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:02,196
I DON'T LIKE YOU.

139
00:06:02,279 --> 00:06:04,531
THIS ISN'T ABOUT ME.

140
00:06:04,615 --> 00:06:06,116
IT'S ABOUT SEAN,
OKAY?

141
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,784
HE IS IN HELL.

142
00:06:08,285 --> 00:06:10,037
YESTERDAY, HE WAS SENT
TO THE INFIRMARY

143
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:12,414
SOME DUDE JUMPED HIM
IN THE CHOW LINE.

144
00:06:12,497 --> 00:06:14,708
JUMPED HIM? WHY?

145
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:17,211
'CAUSE...
HE DIDN'T LIKE SEAN'S FACE.

146
00:06:17,294 --> 00:06:18,712
IT'S JAIL, EMMA.

147
00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:21,673
IT AIN'T YOUR BOYFRIEND'S
COUNTRY CLUB.

148
00:06:21,757 --> 00:06:23,091
JUST MAYBE YOU COULD GO

149
00:06:23,175 --> 00:06:24,676
TO SEAN'S COURT HEARING
TOMORROW?

150
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:25,385
I HAVE TO WORK,

151
00:06:25,469 --> 00:06:26,470
BUT HE COULD USE
A FRIEND.

152
00:06:30,766 --> 00:06:32,267
(CELL PHONE RINGS)

153
00:06:41,693 --> 00:06:43,654
LOOK,
I'M SORRY I BLEW IT,

154
00:06:43,737 --> 00:06:46,406
BUT BEING A JOURNALIST
IS MY LIFE.

155
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:48,158
IF YOU GIVE ME
ANOTHER CHANCE

156
00:06:48,242 --> 00:06:51,662
I PROMISE I WILL NOT
SCREW IT UP.

157
00:06:52,329 --> 00:06:54,706
SEE? THAT'S WHAT YOUR
LAST ARTICLE NEEDED -

158
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:56,458
PASSION,
CONVICTION.

159
00:06:56,542 --> 00:06:57,918
ELLIE:
MY ARTICLE WAS GOOD.

160
00:06:58,001 --> 00:07:00,754
GOOD ENOUGH TO GET ME AN "A"
IN JOURNALISM CLASS.

161
00:07:00,838 --> 00:07:04,091
WELL, THE CORE'S THE FIFTH
LARGEST PAPER IN TORONTO.

162
00:07:04,174 --> 00:07:06,009
WE DON'T HAVE TIME
FOR SCHOOL PROJECTS, FROSH.

163
00:07:06,093 --> 00:07:07,010
MAYBE YOU'D BE FOURTH

164
00:07:07,094 --> 00:07:09,221
IF YOU PRINTED STUFF
PEOPLE CARED ABOUT.

165
00:07:09,304 --> 00:07:12,099
OH, SO YOU KNOW MY JOB
BETTER THAN I DO, HUH?

166
00:07:12,182 --> 00:07:14,017
MAKES YOU PRETTY
DAMN ARROGANT.

167
00:07:14,101 --> 00:07:15,811
ELLIE:
I'M ARROGANT?

168
00:07:15,894 --> 00:07:19,189
I'VE NEVER MET SUCH A POMPOUS,
FULL-OF-HIMSELF JERK.

169
00:07:19,773 --> 00:07:20,858
KINDA MAKES YOU
HATE MY GUTS, HUH?

170
00:07:21,233 --> 00:07:22,860
NO. I'D HAVE TO CARE
TO HATE YOU.

171
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,570
HEY, FROSH,

172
00:07:24,653 --> 00:07:26,238
CARE ENOUGH
TO GET A BEER?

173
00:07:26,321 --> 00:07:27,906
TALK IT OVER?

174
00:07:36,081 --> 00:07:36,957
YOU DROVE?

175
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:39,126
CAN'T YOU GET IN
TROUBLE FOR THIS?

176
00:07:39,209 --> 00:07:41,128
IT'S CALLED
TAKING A RISK.

177
00:07:41,211 --> 00:07:42,713
BESIDES, YOU'RE MORE
THAN WORTH IT.

178
00:07:43,547 --> 00:07:46,884
UGH! YOU'RE WEARING
THAT VANILLA STUFF?

179
00:07:46,967 --> 00:07:48,468
HONEY-VANILLA SHAMPOO.

180
00:07:48,552 --> 00:07:50,929
SORRY, I FORGOT
YOU DON'T LIKE IT.

181
00:07:51,013 --> 00:07:53,307
PROMISE NOT TO USE IT
BEFORE FRIDAY'S DANCE.

182
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:55,184
WHAT? SUDDENLY YOU'VE
BECOME GOVERNOR

183
00:07:55,267 --> 00:07:56,894
AND ISSUE ME A STAY?

184
00:07:56,977 --> 00:07:57,936
BETTER.

185
00:07:58,020 --> 00:07:59,479
I SUGGESTED
A COSTUME PARTY -

186
00:07:59,563 --> 00:08:00,439
A MASQUERADE -

187
00:08:00,522 --> 00:08:02,524
SO YOU CAN BE
MY INCOGNITO DATE.

188
00:08:02,608 --> 00:08:05,277
SNEAKY AND GORGEOUS.
NICE!

189
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:08,822
OKAY.
TIME'S UP, ROMEO.

190
00:08:08,906 --> 00:08:09,698
YOU NEED TO GO HOME.

191
00:08:09,781 --> 00:08:10,449
I DON'T WANT YOU
TO GET INTO

192
00:08:10,532 --> 00:08:11,575
ANY MORE TROUBLE.

193
00:08:11,658 --> 00:08:14,578
I WON'T.
MY MOM'S AT A PTA MEETING.

194
00:08:14,661 --> 00:08:16,496
SO HOW DID YOU
GET THE CAR?

195
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:18,290
FOUND OUT WHERE
SHE HID THE KEYS.

196
00:08:18,373 --> 00:08:20,083
WHAT CAN I SAY?
I'M GOOD.

197
00:08:20,167 --> 00:08:21,502
(CHUCKLES)

198
00:08:25,506 --> 00:08:27,508
THIS IS WEIRD.

199
00:08:27,591 --> 00:08:29,968
BEING IN THIS CAR
AND EVERYTHING.

200
00:08:30,052 --> 00:08:31,094
WHAT?
I DIDN'T HIT THAT GUY.

201
00:08:31,178 --> 00:08:32,012
SEAN DID.

202
00:08:32,095 --> 00:08:33,180
THAT'S WHY HE'S IN JAIL.

203
00:08:33,263 --> 00:08:35,098
BUT YOU DON'T FEEL BADLY?

204
00:08:35,182 --> 00:08:37,309
OH, OF COURSE I DO!
IT'S TERRIBLE.

205
00:08:37,392 --> 00:08:40,062
AN INNOCENT GUY
GETTING HURT.

206
00:08:40,145 --> 00:08:41,980
IT'S A GOOD THING
HE'S OKAY, HUH?

207
00:08:42,064 --> 00:08:43,524
YEAH,
TELL ME ABOUT IT.

208
00:08:43,607 --> 00:08:44,608
IMAGINE IF HE'D DIED?

209
00:08:44,691 --> 00:08:45,400
NO WAY I WOULD'VE
GOTTEN OFF

210
00:08:45,484 --> 00:08:48,904
WITH THAT LITTLE SLAP
ON THE WRIST.

211
00:08:50,739 --> 00:08:51,990
THE TIME.

212
00:08:52,783 --> 00:08:54,284
I SHOULD GO.

213
00:09:08,715 --> 00:09:11,134
ELLIE:
YOU LECTURE ME
ABOUT MY WRITING,

214
00:09:11,218 --> 00:09:13,220
AND THEN YOU GO GA-GA
OVER A BAND

215
00:09:13,303 --> 00:09:14,096
THAT SCREAMS GIBBERISH

216
00:09:14,179 --> 00:09:17,432
INSTEAD OF TAKING THE TIME
TO CRAFT ACTUAL LYRICS.

217
00:09:17,516 --> 00:09:17,891
GIBBERISH?

218
00:09:17,975 --> 00:09:19,518
YOU GOTTA BE
KIDDING ME.

219
00:09:19,601 --> 00:09:21,895
WELL, YOU'RE LUCKY THE MUSIC
WAS A WICKED BLEND

220
00:09:21,979 --> 00:09:23,230
OF ZEPPELIN AND SABBATH.

221
00:09:23,313 --> 00:09:24,731
I'M SO WRITING
THAT REVIEW.

222
00:09:24,815 --> 00:09:26,233
WELL, THIS TIME IT GOES IN.

223
00:09:26,316 --> 00:09:28,360
NO QUESTIONS ASKED.

224
00:09:29,987 --> 00:09:30,696
SO...

225
00:09:31,488 --> 00:09:32,239
SO...

226
00:09:33,532 --> 00:09:36,910
UH... GUESS I...
BETTER GET TO WORK.

227
00:09:36,994 --> 00:09:38,287
YEAH.

228
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:40,789
YEAH.

229
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:51,717
NIGHT.

230
00:09:53,927 --> 00:09:54,845
NIGHT.

231
00:09:57,222 --> 00:09:57,848
(SIGHS)

232
00:09:58,515 --> 00:10:01,185
MARCO:
GUESS THIS MEANS
YOU'RE OFFICIALLY OVER CRAIG?

233
00:10:12,613 --> 00:10:14,198
WHO DIED?

234
00:10:14,281 --> 00:10:15,407
I'M TRYING TO LOOK
RESPECTABLE,

235
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:16,700
NOT FUNEREAL.

236
00:10:19,244 --> 00:10:20,954
YOU'RE GOING TO SEAN'S
COURT HEARING?

237
00:10:21,038 --> 00:10:23,582
WHAT HAPPENED TO THE "ZERO
TOLERANCE O' SEAN" POLICY?

238
00:10:23,665 --> 00:10:24,791
JAY GAVE ME
HIS COURT NOTICE.

239
00:10:24,875 --> 00:10:26,668
I JUST THOUGHT...
I DON'T KNOW.

240
00:10:26,752 --> 00:10:28,045
I THOUGHT I SHOULD CHECK ON
HOW HIS CASE IS GOING.

241
00:10:28,921 --> 00:10:30,130
AND FOR THAT YOU NEED A TOP

242
00:10:30,214 --> 00:10:31,965
THAT BRINGS OUT YOUR
GLOWY, GLOWY SKIN?

243
00:10:32,716 --> 00:10:34,259
YOU WERE WORRIED
ABOUT HIM TOO.

244
00:10:34,343 --> 00:10:34,885
STILL AM.

245
00:10:34,968 --> 00:10:36,845
BUT I'M ALSO WORRIED
ABOUT MY BEST FRIEND,

246
00:10:36,929 --> 00:10:38,805
WHO'S BEING AN EMOTIONAL
PING-PONG BALL.

247
00:10:38,889 --> 00:10:41,308
SEAN, PETER,
PETER, SEAN...

248
00:10:41,391 --> 00:10:42,267
I'M NOT!

249
00:10:42,351 --> 00:10:44,686
I'M WITH PETER
100 PERCENT.

250
00:10:44,770 --> 00:10:47,105
I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE
SEAN'S OKAY, OKAY?

251
00:10:47,189 --> 00:10:48,440
MANNY:
OKAY.

252
00:10:48,524 --> 00:10:49,775
FORGET I ASKED.

253
00:10:52,653 --> 00:10:54,863
(CHURCH BELL RINGS)

254
00:10:57,491 --> 00:10:59,368
EXCUSE ME, I'M LOOKING FOR
SEAN CAMERON'S HEARING,

255
00:10:59,451 --> 00:11:00,160
COURTROOM H?

256
00:11:00,244 --> 00:11:01,119
SEAN:
EMMA!

257
00:11:02,955 --> 00:11:03,914
SEAN.

258
00:11:06,041 --> 00:11:08,043
YOU LOOK TERRIBLE.

259
00:11:08,544 --> 00:11:10,921
UH...I UH... TRIPPED.
FELL.

260
00:11:12,589 --> 00:11:14,591
IT...IT DOESN'T MATTER.

261
00:11:15,759 --> 00:11:18,011
IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU.

262
00:11:23,767 --> 00:11:25,227
OH, VANILLA.

263
00:11:27,688 --> 00:11:29,523
I MISS THAT SMELL.

264
00:11:31,817 --> 00:11:33,569
JAY SAID
YOU WEREN'T COMING.

265
00:11:33,652 --> 00:11:35,696
I WASN'T GOING TO.

266
00:11:35,779 --> 00:11:38,156
UH, BUT I THOUGHT
YOU COULD USE A FRIEND.

267
00:11:52,462 --> 00:11:53,589
THAT WAS FAST.

268
00:11:53,672 --> 00:11:55,090
SEAN:
MY PUBLIC DEFENDER DIDN'T SHOW!

269
00:11:55,174 --> 00:11:56,341
HE'S GOT A BACKLOAD
OF CHARITY CASES

270
00:11:56,425 --> 00:11:57,092
JUST LIKE MINE.

271
00:11:57,176 --> 00:11:58,635
UNLESS I CAN GET SOME MONEY
FOR A REAL LAWYER,

272
00:11:58,719 --> 00:11:59,386
I'M SCREWED.

273
00:11:59,469 --> 00:12:00,721
WHAT CAN I DO?

274
00:12:00,804 --> 00:12:01,972
NOTHING.

275
00:12:03,432 --> 00:12:04,516
JUST TELL ME ONE THING.

276
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,143
TELL ME YOU'RE NOT
STILL WITH PETER.

277
00:12:06,226 --> 00:12:08,103
OF COURSE!
HE'S MY BOYFRIEND.

278
00:12:08,187 --> 00:12:09,813
THAT GUY IS SLIME.

279
00:12:09,897 --> 00:12:11,273
HE PLANTED THOSE DRUGS
IN MY LOCKER.

280
00:12:11,356 --> 00:12:12,107
I ASKED HIM,

281
00:12:12,191 --> 00:12:13,442
AND HE SAID
HE DIDN'T DO THAT.

282
00:12:13,525 --> 00:12:14,860
OH, WHATEVER.

283
00:12:15,944 --> 00:12:17,112
IF YOU DON'T
BELIEVE ME,

284
00:12:17,196 --> 00:12:18,447
THEN WHY ARE YOU
EVEN HERE?

285
00:12:18,530 --> 00:12:20,616
BECAUSE RIGHT OR WRONG,
YOU NEED HELP.

286
00:12:20,699 --> 00:12:23,619
AND I'M GONNA HELP YOU,
SEAN.

287
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:40,844
(KNOCKS ON DOOR)

288
00:12:42,804 --> 00:12:43,639
EMMA, WHERE WERE YOU?

289
00:12:43,722 --> 00:12:45,098
YOU MISSED HOMEROOM.

290
00:12:45,182 --> 00:12:46,517
YES, AND I CAN
EXPLAIN THAT,

291
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:49,061
BUT LISTEN TO THIS FIRST.

292
00:12:49,144 --> 00:12:50,646
WHAT IF JACK MOVED IN
WITH YOU AND MOM,

293
00:12:50,729 --> 00:12:52,064
AND MANNY AND I
TAKE JACK'S ROOM?

294
00:12:52,147 --> 00:12:53,815
THAT WAY WE COULD RENT
OUT THE BASEMENT.

295
00:12:53,899 --> 00:12:55,275
OH WELL...

296
00:12:55,359 --> 00:12:56,652
AS MUCH AS I RELISH
THE IDEA

297
00:12:56,735 --> 00:13:00,072
OF SHARING MY ROOM
WITH A THREE-YEAR-OLD,

298
00:13:00,155 --> 00:13:02,491
WHAT'S THIS ALL ABOUT?

299
00:13:03,283 --> 00:13:05,077
I SAW SEAN TODAY,
AT THE COURTHOUSE.

300
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:08,080
HENCE WHY I MISSED
HOMEROOM.

301
00:13:08,705 --> 00:13:10,624
SNAKE, IT'S BAD.

302
00:13:10,707 --> 00:13:12,626
HE REALLY NEEDS HELP
AND HE'S GOT NO ONE.

303
00:13:12,709 --> 00:13:14,419
SIMPSON:
JAY TOLD ME.

304
00:13:15,504 --> 00:13:16,588
LOOK, I'M GLAD YOU'RE
TAKING UP HIS CAUSE,

305
00:13:16,672 --> 00:13:18,590
BUT WHAT SEAN REALLY NEEDS
RIGHT NOW IS A GOOD LAWYER,

306
00:13:18,674 --> 00:13:20,217
AND THEY COST BIG MONEY.

307
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:21,134
MORE THEN THE PEANUTS
WE'LL EARN

308
00:13:21,218 --> 00:13:23,804
RENTING OUT
A LEAKY BASEMENT.

309
00:13:23,887 --> 00:13:25,722
OKAY, IDEA NUMBER TWO:

310
00:13:25,806 --> 00:13:27,224
FUNDRAISER.

311
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:29,184
THERE'S LOTS OF COMPETITION
OUT THERE

312
00:13:29,268 --> 00:13:31,603
FOR THE CHARITY DOLLAR.

313
00:13:32,479 --> 00:13:33,564
BUT UH...

314
00:13:35,148 --> 00:13:37,109
YOU'LL FIGURE OUT
SOMETHING.

315
00:13:37,192 --> 00:13:38,861
YOU ALWAYS DO.

316
00:13:50,247 --> 00:13:52,416
TORONTO MUSIC WEEK
SHOWCASE?

317
00:13:52,499 --> 00:13:53,917
HOW DID I GET THAT?

318
00:13:54,001 --> 00:13:55,752
AH, IT'S FALL AGAIN...

319
00:13:55,836 --> 00:13:58,714
SCHOOL STARTS,
THE LEAVES CHANGE COLOURS,

320
00:13:58,797 --> 00:14:00,966
AND JESSE GETS IT ON
WITH A NUBILE, EAGER FROSH.

321
00:14:02,968 --> 00:14:05,137
YOU SHOULD TALK,
MS. 2005.

322
00:14:22,237 --> 00:14:23,572
PETER:
SURPRISE!

323
00:14:24,907 --> 00:14:26,825
A MASK BEFITTING
A TRUE QUEEN.

324
00:14:26,909 --> 00:14:28,744
I WAS GOING TO GO
WITH PAPER MACHE,

325
00:14:28,827 --> 00:14:31,538
BUT THIS IS REALLY WOW.

326
00:14:31,622 --> 00:14:32,331
WHEN YOU GONNA REALIZE

327
00:14:32,414 --> 00:14:34,750
YOU DESERVE BETTER
THAN PAPER MACHE?

328
00:14:34,833 --> 00:14:36,960
THAT'S SWEET.
THANK YOU.

329
00:14:37,044 --> 00:14:38,045
WHAT'RE THE TICKETS FOR?

330
00:14:38,128 --> 00:14:39,796
OH, JUST A LITTLE RAFFLE

331
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:42,090
TO MAKE THE DANCE
MORE INTERESTING.

332
00:14:42,174 --> 00:14:43,342
COUNT ME IN.

333
00:14:43,425 --> 00:14:46,011
I GOT GAMBLING
IN MY BLOOD!

334
00:14:57,231 --> 00:15:00,442
WOW! I CAN FEEL MY OVERPRICED
DESIGNER JEANS

335
00:15:00,526 --> 00:15:02,110
NOT FITTING AS WE SPEAK.

336
00:15:02,194 --> 00:15:02,903
DON'T GET USED TO IT.

337
00:15:02,986 --> 00:15:04,947
I ONLY COOK WHEN
I'M MAJORLY STRESSED.

338
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:06,865
MARCO:
WELL, WE SHOULD STRESS YOU OUT
MORE OFTEN.

339
00:15:06,949 --> 00:15:08,825
I THINK YOUR DESIGNER
JEANS ARE SAFE.

340
00:15:12,371 --> 00:15:13,872
MARCO:
OKAY, LAY IT ON ME.

341
00:15:13,956 --> 00:15:15,290
I CAN HANDLE IT.

342
00:15:16,083 --> 00:15:17,543
JESSE CUT MY ARTICLE.

343
00:15:17,626 --> 00:15:18,836
THEN HE ASKED ME OUT
ON A DATE

344
00:15:18,919 --> 00:15:19,586
AND KISSED ME.

345
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:22,089
WELL, HE TRIED TO.

346
00:15:22,172 --> 00:15:23,841
OKAY, THOSE ARE SOME TALL,
DARK, HANDSOME PROBLEMS

347
00:15:23,924 --> 00:15:24,800
THAT YOU GOT THERE.

348
00:15:24,883 --> 00:15:27,678
YEAH, AND THEN HE GAVE ME
THIS PLUM MUSIC ASSIGNMENT

349
00:15:27,761 --> 00:15:30,180
AND SUDDENLY,
I'M LIKE THE NEW CORE TRAMP.

350
00:15:31,348 --> 00:15:33,600
SO, YOU GOTTA CHOOSE.

351
00:15:34,309 --> 00:15:36,562
ELLIE, SELF-RESPECT
OR JESSE?

352
00:15:36,645 --> 00:15:38,605
IT SOUNDS LIKE
A PRETTY EASY CALL.

353
00:15:38,689 --> 00:15:39,815
MARCO, YOU SAW HIM,
RIGHT?

354
00:15:39,898 --> 00:15:41,525
IT IS NOT AN EASY CALL.

355
00:15:41,608 --> 00:15:42,484
YEAH, I KNOW.

356
00:15:42,568 --> 00:15:43,443
BUT, YOU KNOW,
JUST REMEMBER

357
00:15:43,527 --> 00:15:44,695
THAT THE DEVIL'S
NOT UGLY.

358
00:15:44,778 --> 00:15:45,362
OKAY?

359
00:15:45,445 --> 00:15:46,738
I MEAN THE DEVIL
IS CUTE.

360
00:15:46,822 --> 00:15:47,531
WAY CUTE.

361
00:15:47,614 --> 00:15:50,367
I'M TALKING
BRAD PITT CUTE.

362
00:15:51,076 --> 00:15:51,743
DON'T SELL OUT

363
00:15:51,827 --> 00:15:54,371
FOR JUST SOME
PRETTY FACE.

364
00:15:54,454 --> 00:15:56,456
THANK YOU...
FATHER MARCO.

365
00:16:04,423 --> 00:16:07,467
YO, FROSH!
WE'RE GONNA BE LATE.

366
00:16:12,139 --> 00:16:13,098
WHAT?

367
00:16:15,392 --> 00:16:16,935
SORRY, UM...

368
00:16:18,854 --> 00:16:19,521
I CAN'T.

369
00:16:20,522 --> 00:16:23,650
YEAH, I KNOW HOW TRYING
FREE ROCK CONCERTS CAN BE.

370
00:16:23,734 --> 00:16:26,528
ACTUALLY,
I'M MORE INTERESTED IN...

371
00:16:26,612 --> 00:16:29,156
INTERMURAL WATER POLO
FINALS.

372
00:16:30,115 --> 00:16:31,825
ERIC:
SWAPSIES?
(HAPPY LAUGH)

373
00:16:32,701 --> 00:16:34,077
YES!
THAT'S SO RAD!

374
00:16:38,332 --> 00:16:40,876
SO YOU'RE...TURNING DOWN
THE ASSIGNMENT?

375
00:16:41,793 --> 00:16:43,128
WELL LOOK HOW HAPPY
IT'S MADE ERIC.

376
00:16:44,838 --> 00:16:45,923
HMM.

377
00:16:50,135 --> 00:16:50,761
GOODY.

378
00:16:59,186 --> 00:17:00,145
EMMA:
TOBY!

379
00:17:00,812 --> 00:17:02,981
TWO DOLLARS EACH,
THREE FOR FIVE DOLLARS.

380
00:17:03,065 --> 00:17:03,899
IT'S FIFTY-FIFTY.

381
00:17:03,982 --> 00:17:05,984
AND THE OTHER FIFTY
GOES TO...?

382
00:17:06,068 --> 00:17:07,152
A FRIEND OF OURS
IS IN JAIL.

383
00:17:07,236 --> 00:17:08,946
I'M TRYING TO HELP
GET HIM OUT.

384
00:17:09,029 --> 00:17:10,405
YOU'RE TAKING UP MONEY
FOR SEAN

385
00:17:10,489 --> 00:17:12,574
WITHOUT COUNCIL'S
APPROVAL?

386
00:17:12,658 --> 00:17:13,575
AND WHAT DOES MS. H. SAY?

387
00:17:13,659 --> 00:17:14,618
EMMA:
SHHHHH!

388
00:17:14,701 --> 00:17:16,411
MS. H DOESN'T KNOW.

389
00:17:16,495 --> 00:17:17,538
MANNY:
WHAT ARE THOSE FOR?

390
00:17:17,621 --> 00:17:18,372
NOTHING.

391
00:17:18,455 --> 00:17:19,373
SEAN'S DEFENSE FUND.

392
00:17:19,456 --> 00:17:20,290
THANKS, DR. DORKWAD.

393
00:17:20,374 --> 00:17:22,960
YOU'RE WANTED
IN THE O.R.

394
00:17:23,043 --> 00:17:23,961
DOES GORILLA MAN,

395
00:17:24,044 --> 00:17:25,963
A.K.A. PETER
IN A LAME COSTUME,

396
00:17:26,046 --> 00:17:28,423
KNOW YOU'RE SELLING TICKETS
AND COLLECTING MONEY

397
00:17:28,507 --> 00:17:30,217
FOR HIS ARCH-NEMESIS?

398
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:32,261
NO.
AND HE'S NOT GOING TO.

399
00:17:32,344 --> 00:17:34,972
LOOK, I KNOW MY ADVICE
ISN'T ALWAYS DR. PHIL SOLID,

400
00:17:35,055 --> 00:17:36,473
AND WHAT'S HAPPENING
TO SEAN ISN'T FAIR,

401
00:17:36,557 --> 00:17:37,474
BUT BABE?

402
00:17:37,558 --> 00:17:39,852
YOU GOTTA LET HIM GO.

403
00:17:40,519 --> 00:17:43,272
MANNY, I CAN'T HELP IT.

404
00:17:43,355 --> 00:17:45,065
SEAN IS IN HERE.

405
00:17:47,359 --> 00:17:48,443
BUT I CAN'T.

406
00:17:48,527 --> 00:17:50,112
I CAN'T FEEL THIS WAY.

407
00:17:50,195 --> 00:17:50,946
WHEN I WAS IN
THE HOSPITAL,

408
00:17:51,029 --> 00:17:54,616
WHO WAS THERE HOLDING
MY HAND? PETER.

409
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:56,660
AND JUST LOOK AT
THIS GORGEOUS MASK.

410
00:17:56,743 --> 00:17:58,620
PETER BOUGHT IT FOR ME.
IT WAS A SURPRISE.

411
00:17:58,704 --> 00:18:01,456
HE LEFT IT
IN MY LOCKER.

412
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:03,041
YOUR LOCKER?

413
00:18:03,709 --> 00:18:05,127
HE HAS YOUR COMBO?

414
00:18:05,210 --> 00:18:05,627
NO...

415
00:18:06,211 --> 00:18:08,463
THEN HOW'D HE GET IN?

416
00:18:12,384 --> 00:18:13,886
(BANG)
OW! OW!

417
00:18:16,388 --> 00:18:17,806
SOMEONE SPIKE THE PUNCH
OR SOMETHING?

418
00:18:17,890 --> 00:18:18,807
OPEN MY LOCKER,

419
00:18:18,891 --> 00:18:20,642
OR I TELL YOUR MOM
YOU'RE HERE.

420
00:18:20,726 --> 00:18:22,060
OKAY, FINE.
GIVE ME THE COMBINATION.

421
00:18:22,144 --> 00:18:23,729
I THOUGHT YOU KNEW IT.

422
00:18:23,812 --> 00:18:24,980
I WROTE IT DOWN.

423
00:18:25,063 --> 00:18:26,440
FROM WHERE?

424
00:18:26,982 --> 00:18:30,068
MY MOM HAS THEM,
IN HER OFFICE.

425
00:18:32,779 --> 00:18:33,780
PETER...

426
00:18:34,698 --> 00:18:35,991
DID YOU BREAK
INTO SEAN'S LOCKER

427
00:18:36,074 --> 00:18:36,658
AND PLANT THE POT

428
00:18:36,742 --> 00:18:38,577
THE SAME WAY
YOU BROKE INTO MINE?

429
00:18:40,579 --> 00:18:42,539
OKAY, SEAN IS A LOSER.

430
00:18:42,623 --> 00:18:44,082
HE ALWAYS HAS BEEN,
AND HE ALWAYS WILL BE.

431
00:18:44,166 --> 00:18:46,043
ANSWER THE QUESTION!

432
00:18:46,126 --> 00:18:47,503
WELL, WHAT DO YOU
WANT ME TO SAY?

433
00:18:47,586 --> 00:18:48,921
THE TRUTH!

434
00:18:51,215 --> 00:18:52,257
EVERYTHING I DID,

435
00:18:52,341 --> 00:18:53,800
I DID TO KEEP US
TOGETHER.

436
00:18:53,884 --> 00:18:55,886
ALL RIGHT,
SEAN IS SCUM!

437
00:18:55,969 --> 00:18:57,179
HE DESERVED
WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM!

438
00:18:57,262 --> 00:19:00,432
WHEN YOU SEE ME IN CLASS,
DON'T LOOK AT ME.

439
00:19:00,516 --> 00:19:02,893
WHEN YOU PASS ME IN THE HALL,
DON'T TALK TO ME.

440
00:19:02,976 --> 00:19:05,938
BECAUSE YOU AND ME
ARE DONE!

441
00:19:11,276 --> 00:19:12,945
PETER MICHAEL.

442
00:19:13,570 --> 00:19:16,823
DO THE WORDS HOUSE ARREST
MEAN NOTHING TO YOU?

443
00:19:22,579 --> 00:19:23,747
A WHOLE PIECE
ON WATER POLO

444
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:26,375
WITHOUT AT LEAST
ONE REFERENCE TO SPEEDOS?

445
00:19:26,458 --> 00:19:28,669
AND YOU CALL YOURSELF
A JOURNALIST.

446
00:19:28,752 --> 00:19:31,338
ELLIE:
ROOKIE REPORTER MISTAKE.

447
00:19:32,172 --> 00:19:34,174
JESSE:
LOOK...

448
00:19:34,258 --> 00:19:35,175
I DIDN'T GIVE YOU
THE MUSIC PIECE

449
00:19:35,259 --> 00:19:36,760
TO GET INTO YOUR PANTS.

450
00:19:36,844 --> 00:19:38,804
I GAVE IT TO YOU
BECAUSE YOU LOVE MUSIC,

451
00:19:38,887 --> 00:19:40,097
AND EVERYONE ELSE
IS BUSY.

452
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:41,557
GREAT.

453
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:43,433
YOU'RE A GOOD WRITER,
FROSH.

454
00:19:43,517 --> 00:19:45,769
NOT MY FAULT
YOU ALSO HAPPEN TO BE CUTE.

455
00:19:45,853 --> 00:19:48,355
I'M NOT GONNA APOLOGIZE
FOR LIKING YOU.

456
00:19:48,438 --> 00:19:49,606
AND...YOU?

457
00:19:58,699 --> 00:20:00,742
GUESS YOU'RE ALL RIGHT.

458
00:20:00,826 --> 00:20:02,744
BUT ONE QUESTION?

459
00:20:02,828 --> 00:20:04,788
WHAT ARE WE GONNA TELL
EVERYONE?

460
00:20:04,872 --> 00:20:07,374
AND DON'T CALL ME FROSH.

461
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,793
IT'LL BE OUR
LITTLE SECRET...

462
00:20:09,877 --> 00:20:11,295
ELLIE.

463
00:20:16,258 --> 00:20:17,050
SO THE BAD NEWS IS

464
00:20:17,134 --> 00:20:19,178
THAT I ONLY RAISED
$243.00.

465
00:20:20,554 --> 00:20:22,347
I'M GONNA BE
IN JAIL FOREVER.

466
00:20:23,182 --> 00:20:24,892
HMPH!

467
00:20:24,892 --> 00:20:27,728
I'M SORRY ABOUT
WHAT HAPPENED.

468
00:20:27,811 --> 00:20:29,897
WITH PETER, I MEAN.

469
00:20:31,565 --> 00:20:32,691
SOUNDS BRUTAL.

470
00:20:32,774 --> 00:20:34,818
NO, I'M SORRY,

471
00:20:34,902 --> 00:20:36,945
FOR BEING SO BLIND.

472
00:20:37,029 --> 00:20:38,614
SHOULD NEVER HAVE
BELIEVED HIM.

473
00:20:38,697 --> 00:20:40,407
IT'S ALL RIGHT.

474
00:20:41,074 --> 00:20:42,743
SO WHAT'S THE GOOD NEWS?

475
00:20:42,826 --> 00:20:44,244
BESIDES YOU BEING HERE?

476
00:20:44,328 --> 00:20:46,330
SNAKE IS FINDING YOU
A PUBLIC DEFENDANT,

477
00:20:46,413 --> 00:20:47,414
A GOOD ONE.

478
00:20:47,497 --> 00:20:49,166
ONE WHO HAS TIME
TO WORK ON YOUR CASE.

479
00:20:49,249 --> 00:20:50,083
(KNOCKING)

480
00:20:58,842 --> 00:21:01,595
UM, VISITING HOURS
ARE ALMOST OVER.

481
00:21:01,678 --> 00:21:03,847
I GOT YOU SOMETHING.

482
00:21:16,777 --> 00:21:18,612
VANILLA-HONEY SHAMPOO.

483
00:21:20,364 --> 00:21:21,323
I THOUGHT IT WAS
THE NEXT BEST THING

484
00:21:21,406 --> 00:21:24,535
TO ACTUALLY BEING
WITH ME.

485
00:21:29,831 --> 00:21:33,001
NOTHING COULD REPLACE
THE REAL THING.
