YOUR BRAIN'S CLEARLY ALREADY
REDECORATING MY BEDROOM.

ELLIE:
THANK YOU FOR IMPLYING
THAT I'M BORING.

18
00:00:42,918 --> 00:00:43,794
I WASN'T IMPLYING
THAT YOU'RE BORING

19
00:00:43,877 --> 00:00:45,379
JUST BECAUSE YOU DON'T
LIKE DANCING, OKAY?

20
00:00:45,462 --> 00:00:46,630
CAN WE NOT FIGHT
ABOUT THIS NOW?

21
00:00:46,713 --> 00:00:47,631
IT'S EMBARRASSING.

22
00:00:48,465 --> 00:00:49,633
SO YOU'RE MOVING IN,

WELL, AT LEAST YOU HAVE
SOMEBODY.

29
00:01:03,647 --> 00:01:06,775
I, HOWEVER, HAVE BEEN WALKING
THROUGH A ROMANTIC DESERT.

30
00:01:06,859 --> 00:01:08,068
AND MY FEET ARE TIRED.

31
00:01:08,151 --> 00:01:09,695
WELL, DON'T LOOK AT ME
TO RUB 'EM.

32
00:01:09,778 --> 00:01:11,446
BUT I'M SURE WE COULD FIND
A HOT GUY OR TWO

33
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:13,323

YOUR COOL AUTUMN NIGHTS.

34
00:01:13,407 --> 00:01:15,826

THERE IS A MINOR ISSUE

OUR CASH-FLOW ISSUE,

AND WHY IS IT EVERY TIME
I BRING SOMETHING UP -

105
00:04:45,118 --> 00:04:47,746
A-A JOKE, A STORY IDEA,
ANYTHING -

106
00:04:47,829 --> 00:04:49,206
YOU JUST SHOOT IT DOWN?

107
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:50,207
YOU CAN BE SO NEGATIVE,
ELLIE.

108
00:04:51,667 --> 00:04:52,918
GUESS SO.

109
00:04:53,585 --> 00:04:55,045
YOU GUESS SO?

110
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:56,213
TAURUS MUCH?

111
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:57,548
WHATEVER.

112
00:04:58,173 --> 00:04:59,550
I DON'T WANT TO ARGUE
ANYMORE!

113
00:04:59,633 --> 00:05:01,635
IT'S ALL WE'VE DONE
FOR WEEKS.

114
00:05:04,179 --> 00:05:05,264
(SIGHING HEAVILY)

115
00:05:05,347 --> 00:05:06,807
ARGUING WAS BETTER
THAN THIS.

116
00:05:08,058 --> 00:05:09,935
NOT TO MENTION ALL
THE MOVIES AND DINNERS,

117
00:05:10,018 --> 00:05:11,019
AND LAUGHS
WE USED TO HAVE.

118
00:05:13,063 --> 00:05:15,941
THAT'S WHY WE NEED
TO END THIS.

119
00:05:16,024 --> 00:05:17,734
BEFORE IT RUINS
WHAT'S LEFT OF US.

120
00:05:21,196 --> 00:05:22,239
SEE YOU
AT THE STAFF MEETING?

121
00:05:31,748 --> 00:05:34,251
PHARMACIST:
HERE YOU GO.

122
00:05:37,588 --> 00:05:38,630
THESE HAVE "SENSUAL"
IN THE NAME.

123
00:05:38,714 --> 00:05:40,674
IS THAT A GOOD THING?

124
00:05:40,757 --> 00:05:43,343
UH, ARE WE REALLY
GONNA DO THIS?

125
00:05:43,427 --> 00:05:46,388
SEX IS AN EXPRESSION OF OUR
INTIMACY AND CLOSENESS.

126
00:05:46,471 --> 00:05:49,808
YOUR NOSE IS SO GROWING
RIGHT NOW.

127
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:51,185

128
00:05:51,268 --> 00:05:52,352
WHAT'RE YOU DOING HERE?

129
00:05:56,148 --> 00:05:58,692
WELL,
I'M-I'M LATE FOR WORK.

130
00:06:00,402 --> 00:06:01,820

131
00:06:02,529 --> 00:06:04,323
EM, ARE YOU,
ARE YOU SICK?

132
00:06:04,406 --> 00:06:05,115
NO.

133
00:06:07,075 --> 00:06:08,785
IT'S JUST THAT...

134
00:06:09,578 --> 00:06:11,622
WELL, SEAN AND I ARE...

135
00:06:14,249 --> 00:06:15,584
SNAKE?!

136
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:17,961
OH! OH. OH GOD!

137
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:20,047
I'M AN IDIOT.

138
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:20,839
SORRY.

139
00:06:20,923 --> 00:06:23,091
UM, DOES YOUR MOM
KNOW ABOUT THIS?

140
00:06:23,175 --> 00:06:24,801
YEAH.
WE HAD THE TALK.

141
00:06:25,802 --> 00:06:27,054
COOL.

142
00:06:27,137 --> 00:06:29,556
I JUST, YOU KNOW...

143
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:31,475
I, I DIDN'T KNOW.

144
00:06:31,558 --> 00:06:33,810
WELL, I WILL SEE YOU
AT HOME FOR DINNER?

145
00:06:33,894 --> 00:06:36,480
SURE THING.
LATER SKATER.

146
00:06:44,988 --> 00:06:46,323
THANK YOU.

147
00:06:48,534 --> 00:06:51,578
ENTREPRENEUR'S FAIR,
BOOTH 112 -

148
00:06:51,662 --> 00:06:53,330
YOU PLAYED THE MALL LADY
LIKE A DRUM!

149
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:55,832
THANKS, HON.
YOU HELPED TOO.

150
00:06:55,916 --> 00:06:59,044
NAH, I DON'T HAVE THE PAIGE
POWER OF PERSUASION.

151
00:06:59,127 --> 00:07:00,838
BUT WE'RE A GOOD TEAM,
HUH?

152
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:11,181
NOT LOOKING A GIFT PORSCHE
IN THE MOUTH HERE,

153
00:07:11,265 --> 00:07:13,267
BUT WHAT'S GOING ON?

154
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:15,978
BANTING WAS LESS THAN FUN
FOR ME.

155
00:07:16,061 --> 00:07:18,730
SO TO PARAPHRASE
SHERYL CROW,

156
00:07:18,814 --> 00:07:21,733
"I JUST WANNA HAVE
SOME FUN".

157
00:07:21,817 --> 00:07:23,360
FUN'S GOOD.

158
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:27,865
IT'S JUST, THE LAST TIME
WE DID THIS LAST YEAR?

159
00:07:28,407 --> 00:07:29,616
IT ENDED WEIRD.

160
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:31,952
BECAUSE WE HAD
NO GROUND RULES.

161
00:07:32,035 --> 00:07:35,330
THIS TIME WE DO.
WE ARE JUST FRIENDS.

162
00:07:35,414 --> 00:07:37,708
FRIENDS WITH
A BENEFITS PACKAGE.

163
00:07:42,379 --> 00:07:44,214
THOSE ARE BENEFITS
I CAN LIVE WITH.

164
00:07:44,298 --> 00:07:45,757
IT'S THE BEST
OF BOTH WORLDS.

165
00:07:45,841 --> 00:07:47,801
CAJ IS THE WAY
WE ROCK IT.

166
00:07:49,928 --> 00:07:51,305
ALEX:
(LAUGHING)

167
00:07:51,388 --> 00:07:53,056
YOU SAID THAT
WITHOUT LAUGHING?

168
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:54,349
PAIGE:
THE MOMENT OVERTOOK.

169
00:07:54,433 --> 00:07:56,435
IT JUST FELT SO GOOD
TO MACK ON SPINNER

170
00:07:56,518 --> 00:07:57,728
WITH IMPUNITY.

171
00:07:57,811 --> 00:07:58,395
WELL, GREAT.

172
00:07:58,478 --> 00:07:59,646
I HAVE CLASS WITH HIM
IN 20 MINUTES.

173
00:07:59,730 --> 00:08:02,107
I'LL TRY TO IGNORE
HIS BIG DUMB GRINNING FACE.

174
00:08:04,401 --> 00:08:05,360
JESSE, HEY.

175
00:08:06,737 --> 00:08:07,821
HEY.

176
00:08:07,905 --> 00:08:09,406
UH, LATEST EDITION.

THANK YOU SO MUCH.

182
00:08:18,665 --> 00:08:21,502
THE CORE AND SQUATCH DESIGNS
COULD HAVE A FUTURE TOGETHER.

183
00:08:21,585 --> 00:08:22,336
IN BUSINESS.

184
00:08:22,419 --> 00:08:24,421

185
00:08:25,172 --> 00:08:26,507
ALEX, UMM...

WAS.

189
00:08:34,431 --> 00:08:37,100
ELLIE DIDN'T TELL YOU
WE BROKE UP?

190
00:08:37,184 --> 00:08:40,020
SHE KEEPS TO HERSELF
A LOT.

191
00:08:40,103 --> 00:08:41,605

YEAH, THEY'RE PLAYING TONIGHT.
CAMPUS CLUB.

198
00:08:52,824 --> 00:08:54,868
IF YOU'RE INTO IT,
YOU SHOULD COME.

199
00:09:08,090 --> 00:09:11,218
SO, I RAN INTO EM
AT THE PHARMACY TODAY.

200
00:09:11,301 --> 00:09:12,886

SHE'D ASKED YOU.

206
00:09:25,524 --> 00:09:27,442
WELL, WE HAD THE "TALK"
A WHILE AGO.

207
00:09:27,526 --> 00:09:29,611
I TOLD HER TO GO ON THE PILL
WHENEVER SHE WAS READY.

208
00:09:31,613 --> 00:09:33,574
AND I WAS LEFT OUT OF THIS
CONVERSATION, WHY?

209
00:09:33,657 --> 00:09:36,827
DON'T WE TALK ABOUT THESE TYPES
OF THINGS AS A FAMILY?

210
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:38,996
I WASN'T SURE YOU COULD HANDLE
THIS "TYPE" OF THING.

211
00:09:39,079 --> 00:09:40,998
OR IF YOU'D EVEN WANT TO.

212
00:09:41,081 --> 00:09:41,915
IT'S A WOMAN THING.

213
00:09:41,999 --> 00:09:43,375
IT'S A PARENT THING.

214
00:09:43,458 --> 00:09:44,710
AND I WANT TO CONTRIBUTE.

215
00:09:45,669 --> 00:09:50,090

NUTRITIOUS DINNERS NIGHTLY.

00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:51,466
KIDDING.

217
00:09:53,635 --> 00:09:55,554
UM, EMMA, YOU UH,

THERE'S JUST SOME THINGS YOU
DON'T NEED TO KNOW, OKAY?

221
00:10:02,686 --> 00:10:03,604
WELL, PARDON ME

355
00:15:38,021 --> 00:15:39,439
THANKS, LIBERTY.

356
00:15:39,523 --> 00:15:41,191
AH, EMMA?
YOU'RE UP.

357
00:15:45,696 --> 00:15:46,321
YOUR THEME?

358
00:15:46,405 --> 00:15:48,156
EMMA:
WOMEN... AND SEX.

359
00:15:50,325 --> 00:15:51,118
MORE SPECIFICALLY?

360
00:15:51,201 --> 00:15:52,703
IT'S ABOUT HOW MEN
HAVE STIFLED

361
00:15:52,786 --> 00:15:55,414
WOMEN'S SEXUAL EXPRESSION
THROUGHOUT HISTORY.

362
00:15:55,497 --> 00:15:56,373
RIGHT ON, SISTER!

363
00:15:58,542 --> 00:15:59,877
WHEN MEN THINK OF GIRLS,

364
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:01,712
THIS IS WHAT THEY SEE.

365
00:16:01,795 --> 00:16:04,464
BUT, WHEN CONFRONTED
WITH SOMETHING LIKE...

366
00:16:04,548 --> 00:16:04,965
THIS?

367
00:16:06,091 --> 00:16:09,469
A HEALTHY, NATURAL EXPRESSION
OF PHYSICAL INTIMACY,

368
00:16:09,553 --> 00:16:11,138
MEN CAN'T HANDLE IT.

369
00:16:11,221 --> 00:16:11,805
AT ALL.

370
00:16:13,056 --> 00:16:14,516
THEY FEEL FREE
TO RIDE THEIR INSTINCTS.

371
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:15,392
BUT WHEN WOMEN STAND UP

372
00:16:15,475 --> 00:16:18,187
AND DECLARE THEIR RIGHT
TO BE SEXUAL?

373
00:16:18,270 --> 00:16:21,440
IT'S THIS -
A TYPICAL DOUBLE-STANDARD.

374
00:16:22,357 --> 00:16:24,526
MEN DON'T WANT TO HEAR IT.

375

PAIGE:
ARE YOU SURE YOU WANT TO MODEL
JIMMY'S FAB DESIGNS

377
00:16:41,793 --> 00:16:43,670
WITH THAT UNFAB POUT?

378
00:16:43,754 --> 00:16:45,589
I'M NOT POUTING.

379
00:16:47,090 --> 00:16:48,217
OKAY, I AM.

380
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:50,677
LOOK, PAIGE,
HERE'S THE DEAL:

381
00:16:50,761 --> 00:16:53,180
I NEED ALL OF YOU,
OR NONE AT ALL.

382
00:16:54,223 --> 00:16:55,724
BABE, I'M SORRY.

383
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:57,309
I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN
THIS WOULD HAPPEN.

384
00:16:57,392 --> 00:16:59,937
IT'S JUST -
ULTIMATUMS MAKE ME ITCHY.

385
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:02,022
IT'S NOT AN ULTIMATUM,
PAIGE.

386
00:17:02,105 --> 00:17:05,526
BUT IF YOU DON'T BREAK IT OFF
WITH JESSE RIGHT NOW,

387
00:17:05,609 --> 00:17:06,818
WE'RE THROUGH!

388
00:17:06,902 --> 00:17:08,278
AND NOW I'M ITCHY.

389
00:17:08,362 --> 00:17:09,363
DON'T MAKE ME CHOOSE.

390
00:17:09,446 --> 00:17:11,949
YOU WON'T LIKE MY CHOICE.

391
00:17:12,032 --> 00:17:14,701
SO YOU'D PICK
STUPID JESSE!?

392
00:17:14,785 --> 00:17:16,578
WITH HIS STUPID HAIR

393
00:17:16,662 --> 00:17:19,581
AND HIS STUPID SHIRTS
AND HIS STUPID FACE?!

394
00:17:19,665 --> 00:17:20,582
FIVE MINUTE WARNING.

395
00:17:20,666 --> 00:17:22,376
AND YOU'VE GOT A VISITOR,
PAIGE.

396
00:17:24,795 --> 00:17:26,046
JESSE! UM...

397
00:17:26,129 --> 00:17:28,215
WHAT A CRAZY SURPRISE!

398
00:17:28,298 --> 00:17:29,049
WANTED TO WISH YOU LUCK,

399
00:17:29,132 --> 00:17:31,301
AND GET A QUOTE
FOR THE CORE

400
00:17:31,385 --> 00:17:33,637

SUCH A GREAT TIME, HON?

402

GO DRINK A LATTE,

BE GROWNUP ABOUT THIS?

404
00:17:39,518 --> 00:17:40,477
YEAH.

405
00:17:41,687 --> 00:17:42,145
NO.

406

OH, I'M A LOSER?

408
00:17:45,732 --> 00:17:46,900
OKAY... "SPINNER".

409

YOU'LL BE CURSING THAT NAME
AFTER IT KICKS YOUR ASS!

(HYPERVENTILATING)

411
00:17:49,152 --> 00:17:51,154
COME ON, PAIGE,
IN FOR TEN.

412
00:17:51,238 --> 00:17:53,448
ONE, TWO, THREE,
THAT'S IT.

414
00:17:55,075 --> 00:17:56,326
WHATEVER!
YOU SUCK!

415
00:17:56,410 --> 00:17:57,786
WILL YOU BOTH SHUT UP?

416
00:18:00,956 --> 00:18:02,833
YOU. GO STAND OUT FRONT.

417
00:18:02,916 --> 00:18:05,043
YOU, GO PUT ON THE REST
OF YOUR OUTFIT AND A SMILE

418
00:18:05,127 --> 00:18:08,088
BECAUSE WE HAVE TO GO MODEL
THESE FREAKING CLOTHES.

419
00:18:08,172 --> 00:18:09,173
CLEAR?

420
00:18:13,010 --> 00:18:13,844
ALEX, I...

421
00:18:13,927 --> 00:18:14,970
SAVE IT.

422

(DOOR OPENING AND CLOSING)

423
00:18:35,699 --> 00:18:37,326
GOT A MINUTE FOR SOMEONE
WHO'S MEAN,

424
00:18:37,409 --> 00:18:38,577
CRUEL AND HURTFUL?

425
00:18:39,578 --> 00:18:40,495
I HAVE ALL THE TIME
IN THE WORLD,

426
00:18:40,579 --> 00:18:42,080
BECAUSE YOU'RE NONE
OF THOSE THINGS.

427
00:18:46,251 --> 00:18:47,503
I'M SORRY FOR WHAT I DID
IN CLASS.

428
00:18:47,586 --> 00:18:48,879
I KNOW IT KINDA HURT.

429
00:18:48,962 --> 00:18:50,130
SIMPSON:
IT'S FINE.

430
00:18:50,839 --> 00:18:52,257
BECAUSE YOU WERE RIGHT.

431
00:18:56,595 --> 00:18:58,722
AND YOUR PRESENTATION,
BY THE WAY, IT WAS GOOD.

432
00:18:58,805 --> 00:19:00,098
NOT VERY SUBTLE.

433
00:19:00,182 --> 00:19:01,433
BUT GOOD.

434
00:19:03,268 --> 00:19:05,062
(SIGHS HEAVILY)

435
00:19:05,145 --> 00:19:05,812
EMMA,

436
00:19:07,981 --> 00:19:09,149
I'VE KNOWN YOU SINCE
YOU WERE IN A STROLLER,

437
00:19:09,233 --> 00:19:10,526
AND THE IDEA
OF YOU GROWING UP?

438
00:19:10,609 --> 00:19:12,694
IT'S... IT'S A TRIP.

439
00:19:14,112 --> 00:19:15,531
FOR ME TOO.

440
00:19:16,156 --> 00:19:19,076
I MEAN,
I'LL BE MOVING AWAY.

441
00:19:19,159 --> 00:19:21,370
GOING TO UNIVERSITY.

442
00:19:21,453 --> 00:19:24,164
I'M NOT A LITTLE KID
ANYMORE.

443
00:19:24,248 --> 00:19:28,293
I JUST THOUGHT THIS
WAS GOING TO BE EASIER.

444
00:19:31,129 --> 00:19:34,466
I GUESS I'D BETTER
GET USED TO IT.

445
00:19:36,134 --> 00:19:37,302
SO... DAD,

446
00:19:40,681 --> 00:19:42,975
DO YOU WANT TO HAVE
"THE TALK"?

447
00:19:43,058 --> 00:19:44,560
YOU KNOW WHAT?

448
00:19:45,477 --> 00:19:46,395
I THINK I'M GOOD.

449
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:57,656
JIMMY:
WELL, HERE'S TO OUR FIRST
FIREWORKS-FILLED FASHION SHOW.

450
00:19:57,739 --> 00:20:00,534
BUT HEY, THREE NEW BUYERS
CAN'T BE WRONG, RIGHT?

451
00:20:01,535 --> 00:20:02,619
CHEERS.

452
00:20:08,458 --> 00:20:12,004
SO, SPIN SPOKE TO ME
AFTER THE SHOW.

453
00:20:12,087 --> 00:20:14,089
ALL APOLOGIES
FOR FREAKING OUT.

454
00:20:14,173 --> 00:20:15,966
BUT, WE BOTH KNOW
THAT IT JUST...

455
00:20:16,049 --> 00:20:17,759
IT WASN'T MEANT TO BE.

456
00:20:17,843 --> 00:20:19,803
BUT JESSE IS STILL
INTO THE CAJ THING.

457
00:20:19,887 --> 00:20:22,598
SO, WHAT SAY YOU,
WISE COUNSEL?

458
00:20:22,681 --> 00:20:24,057
I SAY THEY BOTH SUCK.

459
00:20:24,141 --> 00:20:26,727
AND FOR THAT MATTER?
SO DO YOU.

460
00:20:28,854 --> 00:20:30,022
(SCOFFS)

461
00:20:35,611 --> 00:20:37,821

YOU SUCK TOO.

462
00:20:37,905 --> 00:20:38,697
SORRY!

463
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:41,783
OH, YOUR APOLOGY IS KILLING ME
WITH ITS PLAINTIVE SINCERITY.

464

GOD,
I HATE YOUR THESAURUS.

465
00:20:43,327 --> 00:20:44,953
AND I HATE HOW YOU'RE
ACTING RIGHT NOW.

466
00:20:45,037 --> 00:20:46,079
WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS?!

467
00:20:49,041 --> 00:20:51,460
BECAUSE I LOVE YOU,
YOU IDIOT.

468
00:20:51,543 --> 00:20:53,378
SO MUCH IT SCARES
THE CRAP OUT OF ME.

469
00:20:55,547 --> 00:20:56,465
WHY?

470
00:20:56,548 --> 00:20:59,593
JUST -
WHY DID YOU TELL ME

471
00:20:59,676 --> 00:21:01,803
TO GO ON ALL THOSE DATES?

472
00:21:01,887 --> 00:21:03,639
BECAUSE I THOUGHT
YOU BEING CAJ WITH GUYS

473
00:21:03,722 --> 00:21:05,891
WAS NOTHING SERIOUS.

474
00:21:05,974 --> 00:21:07,726
AND A LOT BETTER THAN YOU
WITH SOME OTHER GIRL.

475
00:21:09,561 --> 00:21:12,898
I JUST...
CAN'T WITH YOU RIGHT NOW.

476
00:21:15,317 --> 00:21:16,902
I REALLY DO...

477
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:26,578
I REALLY HAVE
TO GO BACK INSIDE.
