I HAVE SOMETHING

13
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:32,783
KIM GOT ME A JOB
AS A COUNSELOR.

14
00:00:32,866 --> 00:00:34,535
DARCY DOES

15
00:00:34,618 --> 00:00:37,037

00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,372

DARCY, I DON'T WANT TO BE

00:00:48,841 --> 00:00:50,342

UNTIL 3 A.M.

44
00:01:58,702 --> 00:02:00,537
IT'S YOU
IN THE FOOD LINE.

45
00:02:00,621 --> 00:02:02,456
BEATS THE HOSPITAL.
YAY, THERAPY!

46
00:02:02,539 --> 00:02:04,791
ALTHOUGH,
COMPARED TO THE CAF?

47
00:02:04,875 --> 00:02:07,169
HOSPITAL FOOD
GETS A BAD RAP.

48
00:02:07,252 --> 00:02:09,755
OH NO.
FOOD AND DRINKS.

49
00:02:09,838 --> 00:02:11,757
WE NEED REFRESHMENTS
FOR THE VARIETY SHOW,

50
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,842
AND I STILL DON'T
HAVE A TECH CREW.

51
00:02:13,926 --> 00:02:15,093
MANNY,
YOU'RE THE DIRECTOR

52
00:02:15,177 --> 00:02:16,470
AND THE LEAD ACTOR.

53
00:02:16,553 --> 00:02:18,931
THIS IS YOUR SHOW,
TAKE CHARGE.

54
00:02:19,014 --> 00:02:20,641
SPINNER:
I'VE BEEN READING BLOGS
BY CHRISTIAN TEENS,

55
00:02:20,724 --> 00:02:22,059
ON ABSTINENCE.

56
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:22,976
IT'S ALL ABOUT PREVENTION.

57
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:26,021
SO, WE HAVE TO FIND WAYS
TO STAY BUSY.

58
00:02:26,104 --> 00:02:27,856
MANNY:
OKAY, ALL YOU DEGRASSI-ITES!

59
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:29,691
THE VARIETY SHOW
NEEDS VOLUNTEERS.

60
00:02:29,775 --> 00:02:32,277
SO, C'MON EVERYONE!
SHOW SOME SUPPORT!

61
00:02:32,361 --> 00:02:33,487
DANNY:
TAKE IT OFF!

62
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:34,780
OOH! OOH! OOH!

63
00:02:35,697 --> 00:02:37,491
HOW PERFECT
IS THIS?

64
00:02:37,574 --> 00:02:38,742
MAN, WHEN GOD
ANSWERS PRAYERS,

65
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:39,910
HE'S QUICK.

66
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:42,120
SIGN US UP, MANNY!

67
00:02:42,204 --> 00:02:45,374
MANNY:
OMIGOSH, SPINNER,
YOU ARE MY HERO.

68
00:02:45,457 --> 00:02:47,167
(CLEARS THROAT)

69
00:02:47,251 --> 00:02:49,294
AND YOU TOO, DARCY.

70
00:02:51,922 --> 00:02:53,006
(SCHOOL BELL RINGS)

71
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:55,843
MS. HATZILAKOS:
SO, GRAD WEEKEND
IS ALMOST HERE,

72
00:02:55,926 --> 00:02:58,387
AND OUR 50TH ANNIVERSARY
VARIETY SHOW

73
00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:01,431
IS COMING TOGETHER
VERY NICELY.

74
00:03:01,515 --> 00:03:03,809
AND ATTENTION SPANS
ARE ZERO,

75
00:03:03,892 --> 00:03:05,143
SO IT MUST MEAN
THAT IT'S TIME

76
00:03:05,227 --> 00:03:07,688
FOR MY POST-SECONDARY
PREPAREDNESS CLASS.

77
00:03:07,771 --> 00:03:09,982
FIRST UP... FINANCES.

78
00:03:10,065 --> 00:03:13,694
UM, MY HOPED FOR UNIVERSITY,
BANTING,

79
00:03:13,777 --> 00:03:15,279
PLETHORA OF SCHOLARSHIPS,

80
00:03:15,362 --> 00:03:16,697
BUT WHEN IT COMES TO ME

81
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:19,825
THEY HAVEN'T BEEN
SO ACCEPT-Y, YET.

82
00:03:19,908 --> 00:03:21,869
WELL, ACCEPTANCES
ARE JUST TRICKLING IN.

83
00:03:21,952 --> 00:03:23,287
AND I'M SURE WHEN
YOURS COMES IN PAIGE,

84
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:25,372
YOU'LL BE PREPARED.

85
00:03:25,455 --> 00:03:26,874
I'M PREPARED
FOR A NERVOUS BREAKDOWN

86
00:03:26,957 --> 00:03:27,958
IF IT DOESN'T.

87
00:03:28,667 --> 00:03:30,878
MAYBE I'LL GET
A TATTOO.

88
00:03:30,961 --> 00:03:31,628
HELLO?

89
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:33,422
DISCUSSING
THE FUTURE HERE -

90
00:03:33,505 --> 00:03:34,464
MY FUTURE.

91
00:03:34,548 --> 00:03:37,426
AS IN THINGS THAT COULD AFFECT
THE REST OF MY LIFE.

92
00:03:37,509 --> 00:03:39,094
OR I COULD LEARN
HOW TO PLAY THE BASS.

93
00:03:39,178 --> 00:03:41,221
THESE ARE YOUR
FUTURE PLANS?

94
00:03:41,305 --> 00:03:43,056
THINGS THAT COULD
HAPPEN NEXT WEEK?

95
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:45,893
ALEX:
IT'S CALLED
"LIVING IN THE NOW".

96
00:03:45,976 --> 00:03:46,560
AND WE BOTH KNOW

97
00:03:46,643 --> 00:03:48,979
THE MOST IMPORTANT THING
ABOUT THE NOW IS ME.

98
00:03:57,988 --> 00:03:59,990
LOOK! THE BIG ENVELOPE
FROM BANTING.

99
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:01,450
AND EVERYONE KNOWS
THE BIG ENVELOPE

100
00:04:01,533 --> 00:04:02,201
MEANS YOU GET IN.

101
00:04:02,284 --> 00:04:03,619
AND I DID!
I GOT IN.

102
00:04:03,702 --> 00:04:05,412
WE ARE SO OUT OF HERE!

103
00:04:05,495 --> 00:04:05,996
YOU'RE LATE,

104
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:08,040
AND OUR BOSS HAS BEEN
BREATHING DOWN MY NECK.

105
00:04:08,123 --> 00:04:10,501
UM, WHAT PART OF,
"WE ARE SO OUT OF HERE"

106
00:04:10,584 --> 00:04:11,418
DIDN'T YOU UNDERSTAND?

107
00:04:11,502 --> 00:04:13,921
WE? I DIDN'T
GET INTO BANTING.

108
00:04:14,004 --> 00:04:15,756
MALE CUSTOMER:
AND DON'T FORGET,
TOPPING HALFWAY,

109
00:04:15,839 --> 00:04:18,258
AND THEN AGAIN ON TOP.
THANKS.

110
00:04:18,342 --> 00:04:20,302
WELL, MAYBE
YOU COULD COME WITH?

111
00:04:20,385 --> 00:04:23,013
WE COULD GET OUR OWN
COZY LITTLE PLACE?

112
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:24,014
ALEX:
SOUNDS COZY.

113
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:25,807
BUT WHAT WOULD I
ACTUALLY DO...

114
00:04:25,891 --> 00:04:27,267
IN KINGSTON?

115
00:04:27,351 --> 00:04:29,102
YOU COULD WORK.

116
00:04:29,186 --> 00:04:31,021
GET A TRANSFER
FROM THE MOVIE THEATRE.

117
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:32,814
YOU CAN KEEP THAT TOPPING
COMING, MISS.

118
00:04:32,898 --> 00:04:33,774
ALEX:
YOU'LL BE STUDYING
YOUR BUTT OFF

119
00:04:33,857 --> 00:04:34,441
AND MAKING NEW FRIENDS.

120
00:04:34,525 --> 00:04:36,151
AND I'LL STILL BE
DISHING OUT POPCORN?

121
00:04:36,235 --> 00:04:37,361
MALE CUSTOMER:
MISS, DO I NEED TO SHOW YOU

122
00:04:37,444 --> 00:04:40,364
WHAT I MEAN BY MORE TOPPING
MYSELF?

(BUTTER SLOSHES)

124
00:04:43,534 --> 00:04:45,160
CAN'T WAIT
FOR YOUR HEART ATTACK.

125
00:04:45,244 --> 00:04:48,038
NEXT TIME YOU INSULT
A CUSTOMER?

126
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:51,041
MAYBE NOT IN FRONT
OF YOUR MANAGER.

127
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:52,417
ALEX, CAN I SEE YOU
IN MY OFFICE?

128
00:04:56,713 --> 00:04:57,339
(SIGHS)

129
00:05:03,011 --> 00:05:04,388
STOP. STOP.

130
00:05:05,764 --> 00:05:07,683
DO I HAVE COOTIES
ALL OF A SUDDEN?

131
00:05:07,766 --> 00:05:09,393
NO, I JUST...

132
00:05:09,476 --> 00:05:11,728
I DON'T WANT IT
TO GO TOO FAR, OKAY?

133
00:05:11,812 --> 00:05:14,189
(IRRITATED EXHALE)
I BET IF MANNY WERE HERE,

134
00:05:14,273 --> 00:05:16,817
SHE'D BE ALL OVER YOU.
JUST LIKE IN THE CAF.

135
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:18,110
AW, THAT WAS NOTHING.

136
00:05:18,193 --> 00:05:19,236
THAT'S JUST MANNY'S WAY.

137
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:21,321
SHE'S ALWAYS LIKE THAT.

138
00:05:21,405 --> 00:05:22,656
I CAN ONLY IMAGINE
WHAT SHE WAS LIKE

139
00:05:22,739 --> 00:05:25,325
WHEN YOU TWO
WERE GOING OUT.

140
00:05:25,409 --> 00:05:27,160
YOU WANT
A PLAY-BY-PLAY?

141
00:05:27,244 --> 00:05:28,620
SPARE ME.

142
00:05:28,704 --> 00:05:29,872
I CAN BARELY STAND
THE IDEA

143
00:05:29,955 --> 00:05:32,916
OF YOU BEING WITH HER
AT ALL.

144
00:05:34,126 --> 00:05:37,462
TRUTH IS,
WHEN I WAS WITH MANNY,

145
00:05:37,546 --> 00:05:39,673
WE DID NOTHING TOGETHER.

146
00:05:39,756 --> 00:05:40,591
ZIP.

147
00:05:42,092 --> 00:05:43,510
YOU'RE SERIOUS?

148
00:05:43,594 --> 00:05:45,179
YEAH, I WASN'T EVEN
INTO HER THAT WAY.

149
00:05:45,262 --> 00:05:47,848
HER WHOLE SEXUAL PAST...

150
00:05:47,931 --> 00:05:49,766
AW, IT JUST
TURNED ME OFF.

151
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:51,518
SO YOU'RE REALLY
A VIRGIN?

152
00:05:51,602 --> 00:05:53,437
SPINNER:
I'M SO VIRGINAL...

153
00:05:54,062 --> 00:05:55,105

(LAUGHING)

155
00:05:57,107 --> 00:05:59,276
I FEEL SO BAD NOW,
ABOUT MANNY.

156
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:02,654
YOU KNOW, IF SHE JUST REPENTED
AND PURIFIED HERSELF,

157
00:06:02,738 --> 00:06:04,948
HER PAST COULD TOTALLY
GO AWAY.

158
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:07,284
YOU CAN DO THAT?

159
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:09,036
YEAH,
IT'S A CEREMONIAL THING.

160
00:06:09,119 --> 00:06:12,372
I THINK IT COULD
REALLY HELP HER.

161
00:06:17,127 --> 00:06:17,878
HEY!

162
00:06:20,339 --> 00:06:21,798
CANDY AND A CHICK FLICK?

163
00:06:21,882 --> 00:06:22,674
SOMEONE'S GOT IT BAD.

164
00:06:22,758 --> 00:06:25,552
YEAH WELL,
IT'S NO "CLOWN ACADEMY II".

165
00:06:25,636 --> 00:06:28,055
BUT IF DARCY'S HAPPY,
I'M HAPPY.

166
00:06:28,138 --> 00:06:29,681
BUT YOU'RE NOT.

167
00:06:29,765 --> 00:06:33,143

EVERYTHING'S PEACHY.

168
00:06:35,437 --> 00:06:36,605

169
00:06:37,231 --> 00:06:39,775
YOU'RE LOOKING AT
THEIR NEWEST ACCEPTEE.

170
00:06:39,858 --> 00:06:41,610
PAIGE,

171
00:06:41,693 --> 00:06:43,362
GET OVER HERE!

172
00:06:44,530 --> 00:06:48,116

174
00:06:49,326 --> 00:06:50,911
THIS IS SO COOL.

175
00:06:50,994 --> 00:06:53,080
OH, CANDY'S ON ME.

176
00:06:53,163 --> 00:06:54,831
IT'S MY TREAT.

177
00:07:01,588 --> 00:07:04,091
THE EVIL ONE MADE ME
CLEAN THE BATHROOMS.

178
00:07:04,174 --> 00:07:05,175

STRIKE THREE:
GOODBYE POLYESTER;

181
00:07:07,761 --> 00:07:09,096
HELLO UNEMPLOYMENT.

182
00:07:09,179 --> 00:07:10,764
I DON'T WANT
THIS STUPID JOB.

183
00:07:10,848 --> 00:07:12,891
IT'S TIME TO MOVE ON,
DO SOMETHING ELSE.

184
00:07:12,975 --> 00:07:14,309
ANYTHING IN MIND?

185
00:07:14,393 --> 00:07:16,061
RIGHT NOW?
NO.

186
00:07:16,144 --> 00:07:17,604
I JUST GOT FIRED.

187
00:07:17,688 --> 00:07:18,647
CAN WE LAY OFF
THE CAREER PLANNING,

188
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:20,691
JUST FOR TONIGHT?

189
00:07:22,359 --> 00:07:24,319
I HAVE TO GO.

190

SPINNER:
I SAW THESE LAST NIGHT.

192
00:07:35,789 --> 00:07:37,457
THEY'RE CLADDAGH RINGS.

193
00:07:37,541 --> 00:07:37,875
SEE...

194
00:07:39,001 --> 00:07:41,628
WHEN THE HEART
FACES THE BODY,

195
00:07:41,712 --> 00:07:43,839
IT MEANS COMMITMENT.

196
00:07:43,922 --> 00:07:45,674
BEING HONEST AND TRUE
TO EACH OTHER.

197
00:07:45,757 --> 00:07:48,510
SPINNER,
THEY'RE BEAUTIFUL.

198
00:07:51,555 --> 00:07:53,765

THERE'S MY FAVOURITE
TECHIE!

204
00:08:13,702 --> 00:08:15,370
THE LIGHTING BOARD

207
00:08:20,834 --> 00:08:23,086
HE SO HAS A THING

208
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:25,339
YOU'RE NUMBER THREE.

209
00:08:26,632 --> 00:08:29,343
AND A LOCK TO LEAD
THE SQUAD NEXT YEAR.

210
00:08:29,426 --> 00:08:30,344
YOU THINK SO?

211
00:08:30,427 --> 00:08:32,054
MANNY:
YEAH, YOU'RE PRETTY,
YOU'RE GRACEFUL,

212
00:08:32,137 --> 00:08:33,764
A NATURAL DANCER.

213
00:08:33,847 --> 00:08:34,848
PLUS, YOU DIDN'T
GET KICKED OFF

214
00:08:34,932 --> 00:08:36,266
'CAUSE EVERYONE SAW
YOUR BOOBS.

215
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:38,352
SO THAT'S A BONUS.

216
00:08:40,145 --> 00:08:42,689
MANNY?
I'VE BEEN THINKING.

217
00:08:42,773 --> 00:08:43,899
YOU KNOW, IF YOU WANT
A FRESH START?

218
00:08:43,982 --> 00:08:46,485

AREN'T EXACTLY MY SCENE.

222
00:08:52,699 --> 00:08:54,034
TRUST ME,
ANYONE CAN CHANGE.

223
00:08:54,117 --> 00:08:55,619
I MEAN, LOOK AT SPIN.

224
00:08:55,702 --> 00:08:58,997
PRAYER, ABSTINENCE...
HE'S A BELIEVER.

225
00:08:59,081 --> 00:09:01,083
AS IN ABSTI-NO-SEX?

226
00:09:01,792 --> 00:09:03,710
KUDOS TO YOU FOR MAKING
THAT HAPPEN WITH SPIN.

227
00:09:03,794 --> 00:09:05,712
YOU MUST BE
A MIRACLE WORKER.

228
00:09:05,796 --> 00:09:07,756
WAIT. UM,

229
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:10,801

ALEX.

237
00:09:34,658 --> 00:09:35,993
THANKS FOR NOTHING.

238
00:09:37,619 --> 00:09:40,455
OH, "A MINUS".
I AM ON FIRE.

239
00:09:42,457 --> 00:09:45,544
THAT'LL IMPRESS THE PANTS OFF
ANY ADMISSIONS OFFICE.

240

JIMMY:
I HOPE SO.

241
00:09:46,378 --> 00:09:47,671

00:09:48,922 --> 00:09:50,591
IT'S STILL ALL
UP IN THE AIR.

ALEX:
YOU DON'T KNOW EXACTLY
WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN,

245
00:09:52,384 --> 00:09:54,011
AND THE SKY ISN'T FALLING?

246
00:09:54,094 --> 00:09:54,928
AMAZING.

247
00:09:55,012 --> 00:09:57,097
MM. SHE'S HIGH

00:09:57,181 --> 00:09:59,725
SIDE EFFECT
OF BEING FIRED.

249
00:09:59,808 --> 00:10:02,060
I'LL GET ANOTHER JOB.

250
00:10:02,144 --> 00:10:04,146
OR THERE'S ALWAYS WELFARE.

251
00:10:04,229 --> 00:10:07,733
GREAT PLAN, ALEX.
THAT SOUNDS LIKE FUN.

252
00:10:07,816 --> 00:10:08,775
FUN.

253
00:10:08,859 --> 00:10:11,862
DO YOU EVEN KNOW
WHAT THAT IS?

254
00:10:11,945 --> 00:10:14,072
THIS, THIS IS FUN.

255
00:10:14,156 --> 00:10:15,991
DO YOU REALIZE
HOW CLOSE I AM

256
00:10:16,074 --> 00:10:18,243
TO THAT SCHOLARSHIP?

257
00:10:19,369 --> 00:10:20,954
YOU WANT FUN?

258
00:10:21,663 --> 00:10:23,999
LET'S CUT CLASS TOMORROW.

259
00:10:24,082 --> 00:10:25,125
DO SOMETHING
WE'VE NEVER DONE BEFORE;

260
00:10:25,209 --> 00:10:26,418
SOMETHING WILD
AND CRAZY

261
00:10:26,502 --> 00:10:28,420
AND TOTALLY NUTS.

262
00:10:30,214 --> 00:10:32,257
OR THERE'S A SALE ON
AT THE MALL.

263
00:10:34,384 --> 00:10:35,844
YOU'RE STARTING
WITH THE 60S,

264
00:10:35,928 --> 00:10:37,387
THEN MOVING ON
TO THE 1800'S?

265
00:10:37,471 --> 00:10:38,639
THIS IS A MESS!

266
00:10:38,722 --> 00:10:40,974
OKAY, IT'S CALLED
CREATIVE LIBERTY, LIBERTY.

267
00:10:41,058 --> 00:10:44,520
AND I AM AN ACTOR,
NOT A HISTORIAN.

268
00:10:44,603 --> 00:10:45,979
FINE. BUT I DON'T THINK
CHARLOTTE DEGRASSI

269
00:10:46,063 --> 00:10:48,065
HAD AN MP3 PLAYER.

270
00:10:48,899 --> 00:10:50,567
I NEED TO STEAL
YOUR BOYFRIEND, DARCY.

271
00:10:51,944 --> 00:10:54,821
LIBERTY:
NATE HAS MONO.
SPINNER, YOU ARE VICTOR.

00:10:56,573 --> 00:10:58,075
W-W-WAI-WAIT.
I'M ON LIGHTING.

274
00:10:58,158 --> 00:10:59,243
I'M MORE OF
A BEHIND-THE-SCENES

275
00:10:59,326 --> 00:11:00,160
KIND OF GUY.

276
00:11:00,244 --> 00:11:01,286
YEAH,
THE SHOW'S IN TWO DAYS.

277
00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:03,163
WE DON'T HAVE TIME
TO DISCUSS THIS.

278
00:11:03,247 --> 00:11:04,081
READ, NOW.

279
00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:08,794
UM... CHARLOTTE,

00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:11,713
PROMISE ME
YOU'LL BE MINE FOREVER.

281
00:11:11,797 --> 00:11:12,548
OF COURSE, VICTOR.

282
00:11:12,631 --> 00:11:15,175
OUR LOVE SHALL LAST
A LIFETIME.

283
00:11:15,259 --> 00:11:16,593
MARRY ME,
CHARLOTTE.

284
00:11:16,677 --> 00:11:19,346
I WILL, VICTOR!

SPINNER AND MANNY:
(LAUGHING)

287
00:11:23,141 --> 00:11:25,102
WHAT WAS THAT?

288
00:11:25,185 --> 00:11:27,521
UM, IT'S JUST PART
OF THE SKETCH, SWEETIE.

289
00:11:27,604 --> 00:11:28,689
IT'S IN THE SCRIPT.

290
00:11:28,772 --> 00:11:30,566
MANNY,
I'M NOT STUPID.

291
00:11:30,649 --> 00:11:32,401
YOU'RE CONSTANTLY
FLIRTING WITH MY BOYFRIEND.

292
00:11:32,484 --> 00:11:34,570
YOU STILL LIKE HIM.

293
00:11:35,529 --> 00:11:36,697
OKAY,
I'M BACK ON LIGHTING.

294
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:40,409
UM, WHO WANTS TO BE
MANNY'S ACTING PARTNER?

295
00:11:41,326 --> 00:11:42,494
ANYBODY?

296
00:11:43,287 --> 00:11:45,205
YEAH, NOT SURPRISING.

297
00:11:45,289 --> 00:11:46,540
WHAT IS THAT
SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

298
00:11:46,623 --> 00:11:48,667
MANNY, EVEN YOU CAN
BECOME PURE AGAIN.

299
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:50,502
ALL IT TAKES
IS REPENTANCE.

300
00:11:50,586 --> 00:11:52,296
YEAH,
I'LL GET RIGHT ON THAT.

301
00:11:52,379 --> 00:11:53,338
WELL, YOU SHOULD,

302
00:11:53,422 --> 00:11:57,509
CONSIDERING YOU ARE
THE SCHOOL'S BIGGEST SLUT.

303
00:11:57,593 --> 00:12:01,597
YOU ARE THE LAST PERSON
TO EVER CALL ME THAT.

304
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,265
MALE STUDENT:
OH! OH!

305
00:12:03,348 --> 00:12:04,474
OHHH!

306

GET UP!

310
00:12:10,731 --> 00:12:13,734
HAVE YOU TWO GONE
COMPLETELY PSYCHO?

311
00:12:17,487 --> 00:12:19,281
YOU LIED ABOUT BEING
A VIRGIN, SPINNER.

312
00:12:19,364 --> 00:12:20,866
SHE TOLD ME.

313
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:27,915

WHAT ARE YOU GUYS
STARING AT?

317
00:12:37,299 --> 00:12:38,008
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

318
00:12:39,676 --> 00:12:41,762
OKAY. HOW'S THIS?

319
00:12:41,845 --> 00:12:43,680
GOOD MORNING,
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,

320
00:12:43,764 --> 00:12:44,681
FRIENDS AND FAMILY,

321
00:12:44,765 --> 00:12:46,266
TEACHERS
AND ADMINISTRATORS-

322
00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:47,851
OH, I THINK YOU LEFT OUT
THE JANITOR?

323
00:12:47,935 --> 00:12:49,353
PAIGE, IT'S A VALEDICTORIAN
SPEECH.

324
00:12:49,436 --> 00:12:50,312
I WANT TO BE INCLUSIVE.

325
00:12:51,897 --> 00:12:52,689
REFILLS?

326
00:12:54,274 --> 00:12:54,691
WHOA!

327
00:12:55,317 --> 00:12:56,985
YOU LOOK LIKE YOU JUST LIVED
THROUGH A COUNTRY SONG.

328
00:12:57,069 --> 00:12:58,987
MY DOG IS FINE.
MY TRUCK RUNS TOO.

329
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:00,989
MUST BE GIRL TROUBLE.

330
00:13:01,073 --> 00:13:01,990
MARCO:
HA, NO KIDDING.

331
00:13:02,074 --> 00:13:04,535
YOU DIDN'T HEAR ABOUT
THE DARCY/MANNY CAGE MATCH?

332
00:13:05,202 --> 00:13:06,828
SPINNER:
DUDE, DON'T REMIND ME.

333
00:13:06,912 --> 00:13:08,455
DARCY'S COMPLETELY CONVINCED

334
00:13:08,539 --> 00:13:10,791
THAT THERE'S SOMETHING
GOING ON WITH ME AND MANNY.

335
00:13:10,874 --> 00:13:13,710
(SCOFFS)
JEALOUSY IS A NASTY THING.

336
00:13:13,794 --> 00:13:15,254
SPINNER:
'KAY, BUT THERE'S NOTHING
TO BE JEALOUS OF

337
00:13:15,337 --> 00:13:16,797
'CAUSE I'M NOT CHEATING
WITH MANNY.

338
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,465
THAT'S BESIDES THE POINT, HON.

339
00:13:18,549 --> 00:13:20,425
DARCY IS JEALOUS
OF YOUR PAST,

340
00:13:20,509 --> 00:13:21,301
NOT YOUR PRESENT.

341
00:13:21,385 --> 00:13:22,719
THERE'S NOTHING YOU CAN DO.

342
00:13:22,803 --> 00:13:23,804
UNLESS YOU CAN -

343
00:13:23,887 --> 00:13:25,722
I DON'T KNOW -
SOMEHOW CREATE A TIME MACHINE

344
00:13:25,806 --> 00:13:27,474
AND ERASE THAT PAST.

345
00:13:33,856 --> 00:13:35,315
ALEX:
YOU SHOULD ADD THIS
TO YOUR LIST.

346
00:13:35,399 --> 00:13:37,025
I THINK YOU MIGHT
REALLY LIKE HER.

347
00:13:37,109 --> 00:13:38,902
THANKS, HON.

348
00:13:38,986 --> 00:13:40,070
UM, SO...

349
00:13:40,946 --> 00:13:45,367
HAVE YOU GIVEN ANY THOUGHT TO,
YOU KNOW, BANTING?

350
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:47,160
THE FUTURE?

351
00:13:47,244 --> 00:13:48,287
NOPE.

352
00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:48,829
IT'S MONTHS AWAY.

353
00:13:48,912 --> 00:13:50,581
WHY WOULD IT EVEN BE
CROSSING MY MIND?

354
00:13:52,499 --> 00:13:53,542
BECAUSE...

355
00:13:53,625 --> 00:13:56,086
IT'S IMPORTANT
TO HAVE A PLAN;

356
00:13:56,170 --> 00:13:57,004
TO KNOW WHAT'S
GOING ON;

357
00:13:57,087 --> 00:13:59,965
TO HAVE SOME
SORT OF DIRECTION.

358
00:14:00,048 --> 00:14:01,800
IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT
TO HAVE FUN.

359
00:14:01,884 --> 00:14:03,510
WHICH, BY THE WAY,
TODAY HAS BEEN COMPLETELY

360
00:14:03,594 --> 00:14:04,845
AND UTTERLY LACKING.

361
00:14:04,928 --> 00:14:07,598
FINE. WHAT'S FUN?
SHOW ME.

362
00:14:08,432 --> 00:14:09,975
I DON'T KNOW.

363
00:14:10,058 --> 00:14:11,643
TAKE THAT CD.

364
00:14:12,769 --> 00:14:14,021
EXCUSE ME?

365
00:14:14,104 --> 00:14:16,064
YOU'VE NEVER STOLEN ANYTHING
IN YOUR LIFE BEFORE,

366
00:14:16,148 --> 00:14:17,065
HAVE YOU?

367
00:14:17,149 --> 00:14:18,942
AND I'M NOT ABOUT
TO START.

368
00:14:19,026 --> 00:14:21,695
IT'S A RUSH.
JUST TRY IT.

369
00:14:21,778 --> 00:14:24,031
NO THANK YOU,
REALLY.

370
00:14:26,283 --> 00:14:27,326
(ALARM BEEPS)

371
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:31,622
(ANGRY SIGH)

372
00:14:32,789 --> 00:14:36,376
PAIGE:
HI, I'M SORRY.
THAT WAS AN ACCIDENT.

373
00:14:39,922 --> 00:14:41,215
MARCO:
SURE YOU WANT TO DO THIS?

374
00:14:41,298 --> 00:14:42,716
SPINNER:
DUDE, I'M SURE, OKAY?

375
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:44,301
THE QUESTION IS,
WHAT ABOUT YOU?

376
00:14:44,384 --> 00:14:45,802
I MEAN,
YOU AND FRIENDSHIP CLUB

377
00:14:45,886 --> 00:14:47,221
DIDN'T EXACTLY
HIT IT OFF.

378
00:14:47,304 --> 00:14:48,514
AH, OLD NEWS, BUD.

379
00:14:48,597 --> 00:14:51,600
I'M JUST, I'M HAPPY YOU
EVEN ASKED ME TO HELP.

380
00:14:51,683 --> 00:14:53,810
HEY GUYS.
WHAT'S GOING ON?

381
00:14:56,897 --> 00:14:58,315
SPINNER:
YOU ARE MY EVERYTHING.

382
00:14:58,398 --> 00:15:02,486
AND RIGHT NOW,
IN FRONT OF ALL OUR FRIENDS,

383
00:15:04,029 --> 00:15:05,572
I WANT TO START OVER.

384
00:15:05,656 --> 00:15:07,574
WITH A CLEAN SLATE.
I WANT TO PURIFY MYSELF

385
00:15:07,658 --> 00:15:10,577
AND BECOME A VIRGIN...
AGAIN.

386
00:15:10,661 --> 00:15:12,955
IT'S NOT JUST A MATTER
OF SAYING IT.

387
00:15:13,038 --> 00:15:15,707
DARCY, I WAS UP ALL NIGHT
MEMORIZING SCRIPTURE.

388
00:15:15,791 --> 00:15:17,793
I WANT TO DO THIS.

389
00:15:20,671 --> 00:15:22,548
I, GAVIN MASON,

390
00:15:22,631 --> 00:15:25,425
PROMISE TO HONOUR GOD
WITH MY BODY.

391
00:15:25,509 --> 00:15:26,885
I WILL RESIST TEMPTATION

392
00:15:26,969 --> 00:15:28,637
AND TO SAVE MYSELF
FOR MARRIAGE.

393
00:15:31,014 --> 00:15:32,516
"COME NOW,
LET US REASON TOGETHER,"

394
00:15:32,599 --> 00:15:33,684
SAYS THE LORD.

395
00:15:33,767 --> 00:15:35,060
"THOUGH YOUR SINS
ARE LIKE SCARLET,

396
00:15:35,143 --> 00:15:36,353
THEY SHALL BE AS WHITE
AS SNOW."

397
00:15:44,361 --> 00:15:45,028
PAIGE:
THAT WASN'T FUNNY.

398
00:15:45,112 --> 00:15:46,530
IT WAS STUPID
AND EMBARRASSING.

399
00:15:46,613 --> 00:15:47,948
COULD YOU NOT BE
SUCH A DRAMA QUEEN?

400
00:15:48,031 --> 00:15:50,868
CAN YOU NOT BE SO IMMATURE?

401
00:15:50,951 --> 00:15:52,327
I CAN'T DO THIS.

402
00:15:52,411 --> 00:15:53,662
CAN'T DO WHAT?

403
00:15:53,745 --> 00:15:56,582
THIS "LIVING IN THE MOMENT"
THING.

404
00:15:56,665 --> 00:15:58,584
I NEED STRUCTURE:

405
00:15:59,209 --> 00:16:00,627
PLANS, IDEAS,

406
00:16:00,711 --> 00:16:01,044
AND...

407
00:16:02,337 --> 00:16:06,049
MAYBE JUST A LITTLE EXCITEMENT
ABOUT THE FUTURE -

408
00:16:06,133 --> 00:16:07,551
OUR FUTURE.

409
00:16:08,385 --> 00:16:09,303
IT'S YOUR FUTURE,
PAIGE,

410
00:16:09,386 --> 00:16:10,637
NOT MINE.

411
00:16:11,889 --> 00:16:14,057
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

412
00:16:14,892 --> 00:16:16,685
IT MEANS I HAVE TO
FIGURE OUT WHAT I WANT;

413
00:16:16,768 --> 00:16:19,062
WHAT'S GOOD FOR ME.

414
00:16:19,146 --> 00:16:20,814
FOLLOWING YOU
TO BANTING?

415
00:16:20,898 --> 00:16:22,649
WORKING SOME CRAP
MINIMUM-WAGE JOB

416
00:16:22,733 --> 00:16:25,152
AND BEING YOUR LAPDOG?

417
00:16:25,235 --> 00:16:27,487
DOES THAT SOUND GOOD?

418
00:16:29,573 --> 00:16:31,450
MAYBE I'LL GO TO COLLEGE,
MAYBE I'LL JOIN THE ARMY,

419
00:16:31,533 --> 00:16:34,494
MAYBE I'LL START A BUSINESS -
I DON'T KNOW.

420
00:16:34,578 --> 00:16:36,455
BUT I HAVE TO
FIGURE IT OUT,

421
00:16:36,538 --> 00:16:38,373
ON MY TIMETABLE.

422
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:43,837
WHAT'RE YOU TRYING
TO SAY?

423
00:16:43,921 --> 00:16:46,131
I THINK YOU CAN
FIGURE IT OUT.

424
00:16:46,215 --> 00:16:49,801
YOU ALWAYS WERE
THE SMART ONE, PAIGE.

425
00:17:03,357 --> 00:17:06,109
HMM...
SMILING AND CHEWING.

426
00:17:06,193 --> 00:17:07,194
THAT'S TALENT.

427
00:17:07,277 --> 00:17:09,321
I'M HAPPY,
FOR YOU.

428
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:12,366
'CAUSE YOU GET TO
START ALL OVER AGAIN.

429

(DOG BARKS)

430
00:17:14,785 --> 00:17:16,245
WELL, IT FEELS GOOD.

431
00:17:16,328 --> 00:17:18,038
IT'S LIKE BEING
FACTORY FRESH.

432
00:17:18,121 --> 00:17:20,707
MAN, WHO WOULDA THOUGHT
I'D BE VIRGIN AGAIN?

433
00:17:20,791 --> 00:17:22,709
NOT AFTER LAST SUMMER.

434
00:17:22,793 --> 00:17:26,171
BUT WAIT,
YOU AND MANNY WERE TOGETHER

435
00:17:26,255 --> 00:17:28,048
DURING THE SCHOOL YEAR.

436
00:17:28,131 --> 00:17:29,174
I DON'T GET IT.

437
00:17:29,258 --> 00:17:29,508
UM...

438
00:17:30,801 --> 00:17:33,846
DARCY, MANNY?
SHE WAS MY FIRST...

439
00:17:35,055 --> 00:17:36,473
BUT SHE WASN'T MY LAST.

440
00:17:37,474 --> 00:17:38,392
HOW MANY EXACTLY?

441
00:17:40,143 --> 00:17:41,353
TWO.

442
00:17:41,436 --> 00:17:44,064
YOU HAD SEX
WITH TWO OTHER GIRLS?!

443
00:17:44,147 --> 00:17:46,483
SPINNER:
YEAH, BUT THAT WAS BEFORE
I MET YOU.

444
00:17:46,567 --> 00:17:47,651
UH, BEFORE I FOUND CHRIST.

445
00:17:47,734 --> 00:17:49,611
SINCE THEN I'VE DONE
NOTHING WRONG.

446
00:17:49,695 --> 00:17:50,904
BUT YOU LIED!

447
00:17:50,988 --> 00:17:52,447
SO,
I WAS STILL CLEANSED.

448
00:17:52,531 --> 00:17:53,448
IT'S ALL GOOD.

449
00:17:53,532 --> 00:17:55,075
NO. IT'S NOT.

450
00:17:55,659 --> 00:17:56,743
HOW AM I EVER GOING
TO TRUST YOU?

451
00:17:56,827 --> 00:17:58,453
YOU LIED TO ME, SPINNER.

452
00:17:58,537 --> 00:17:59,872
THIS WHOLE THING,
IT'S NOT-

453
00:17:59,955 --> 00:18:02,958
IT'S NOT ABOUT LYING
OR GOD OR ANYTHING,

454
00:18:03,041 --> 00:18:06,170
EXCEPT YOU
AND YOUR STUPID JEALOUSY!

TO BELIEVE.

BE CLEAN ENOUGH -
