00:00:08,926 --> 00:00:10,469
WHAT? NOW?

00:00:10,552 --> 00:00:12,054
I DON'T EVEN HAVE

11
00:00:47,673 --> 00:00:48,632
I'VE GOT TO JUDGE
VIDEO ANNOUNCEMENTS

12
00:00:48,715 --> 00:00:49,883

13
00:00:51,802 --> 00:00:52,177
WELL, BELIEVE ME,

00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:00,352
JT:

18
00:01:00,435 --> 00:01:02,396
I WANNA KNOW IF IT'S SOMETHING

39
00:02:06,752 --> 00:02:09,963
JUST AS SOON AS OUR STUDENT

40
00:02:10,047 --> 00:02:11,173
WITH HER MAN-SERVANT.

41
00:02:11,256 --> 00:02:11,882
HA HA.

42
00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:13,634
I'M ACTUALLY HERE
TO AUDITION.

43
00:02:13,717 --> 00:02:15,177
FOR I SEEK NOT ONLY
TO INFORM,

44
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:16,845
BUT TO ENTERTAIN,
AS WELL.

45
00:02:16,929 --> 00:02:18,972
YOU'RE AUDITIONING?

46
00:02:19,056 --> 00:02:20,140
IS THERE A PROBLEM
WITH THAT?

47
00:02:20,224 --> 00:02:21,767
I'M SORRY,
BUT EARLY MORNINGS?

48
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:23,769
WRITING COPY?
BEING ON TIME?

49
00:02:23,852 --> 00:02:25,938
DOES THAT SOUND LIKE
JT YORKE TO YOU?

50
00:02:26,021 --> 00:02:28,982
LIBERTY, THIS IS KINDA
IMPORTANT TO ME.

51
00:02:29,066 --> 00:02:31,151
WHEN THAT LITTLE LIGHT
GOES ON,

52
00:02:31,235 --> 00:02:33,153
IT'S A RUSH.
IT DRAWS ME IN.

53
00:02:33,237 --> 00:02:35,447
LIKE A MOTH
TO A BUG ZAPPER.

54
00:02:35,531 --> 00:02:36,782
ARE YOU SURE BECOMING
AN ENTERTAINER

55
00:02:36,865 --> 00:02:39,076
IS A RESPONSIBLE,
MATURE CAREER PATH?

56
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:40,327
WHAT'S THAT
SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

57
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:43,413
NOTHING.
DO WHAT YOU WANT, JT.

58
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:46,750
JT:
I'LL JUST SEE YOU
IN CLASS.

59
00:02:46,834 --> 00:02:49,253

75
00:03:29,668 --> 00:03:32,462
YEAH, I HAD SOME PROBLEMS.

76
00:03:32,546 --> 00:03:34,298
WHAT KIND OF PROBLEMS?

77
00:03:34,381 --> 00:03:37,009
MY DOG... GOT SICK
WITH LEUKEMIA.

78
00:03:37,092 --> 00:03:40,429
ALL HIS FUR FELL OUT
RIGHT AROUND EXAMS.

79
00:03:40,971 --> 00:03:43,223
AND I WAS JUST TOO BROKEN UP
OVER SPARKY-

80
00:03:43,307 --> 00:03:44,474
WOW...

87
00:03:56,403 --> 00:03:58,739
DON'T YOU HAVE TO RUB
LIBERTY'S FEET OR SOMETHING?

88
00:03:58,822 --> 00:03:59,781
LOOK, IT'S JUST...

89
00:03:59,865 --> 00:04:01,491

90
00:04:01,575 --> 00:04:03,076
YOU GOTTA BE THE MAN,

91
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:03,577
OH, BELIEVE ME,

93
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:06,079
ALL SUMMER LONG.

94
00:04:06,163 --> 00:04:07,456

DOZENS OF TIMES.

97
00:04:10,292 --> 00:04:12,127
SHE ESPECIALLY LIKES IT
WHEN I-

98
00:04:12,211 --> 00:04:16,089
♪ OH CAAA-NA-DAAAA!
OUR HOME AND NATIVE LAND- ♪

99
00:04:16,173 --> 00:04:17,799
OKAY, I'LL STOP.

100
00:04:17,883 --> 00:04:19,968
SO... WHY IS SHE BARKING

101
00:04:20,052 --> 00:04:22,054
SHE JUST BECAME STUDENT
COUNCIL PRESIDENT, OKAY?

102
00:04:22,137 --> 00:04:23,764
MY VIRGINAL FRIEND.

103
00:04:23,847 --> 00:04:25,224
SHE'S STRESSED.

104
00:04:25,307 --> 00:04:28,101
SO MAYBE ALL SHE NEEDS
IS A LITTLE...

105
00:04:28,185 --> 00:04:29,811
DE-STRESSING.

106
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:33,482
SPINNER:

107
00:04:33,565 --> 00:04:35,400
C'MON, MAN,
WILL YOU JUST GIMME A CHANCE?

108
00:04:35,484 --> 00:04:36,527
IT'S A WHOLE NEW YEAR.

109
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:37,819
LOOK, JUST 'CAUSE
THEY LET YOU BACK,

110
00:04:37,903 --> 00:04:39,863
IT DOES NOT CHANGE
WHO YOU ARE.

111
00:04:39,947 --> 00:04:42,282
SPINNER:
BUT I HAVE CHANGED, MAN,
I HAVE.

112

(ANNOUNCEMENTS IN BACKGROUND)

113
00:04:52,918 --> 00:04:55,087
LISTEN, I'VE GOTTA
TELL YOU SOMETHING.

114
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:56,505
'KAY? THE TRUTH.

115
00:04:56,588 --> 00:04:57,589
I WAS...

116
00:04:58,382 --> 00:05:00,759
I WAS EXPELLED LAST YEAR.

117
00:05:00,843 --> 00:05:02,636
OKAY.
THAT'S A START.

118
00:05:02,719 --> 00:05:03,554
WHY?

119
00:05:04,054 --> 00:05:06,139
I GOT ROPED
INTO SOMETHING.

120
00:05:06,223 --> 00:05:08,100
WE PLAYED A LITTLE PRANK
ON THIS GUY,

121
00:05:08,183 --> 00:05:09,351
AND HE WENT PSYCHO.

122
00:05:09,434 --> 00:05:10,727
HE CAME TO SCHOOL SHOOTING.

123
00:05:10,811 --> 00:05:11,979
I KNOW ALL ABOUT IT.

124
00:05:12,062 --> 00:05:14,022
I JUST DIDN'T KNOW
YOU WERE INVOLVED.

125
00:05:14,106 --> 00:05:17,234
ONLY IN THE MOST
INDIRECT WAY.

126
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:19,319
AND I'VE- I'VE MORE
THAN PAID FOR IT,

127
00:05:19,403 --> 00:05:22,447
BUT PEOPLE AROUND HERE,
THEY...

128
00:05:22,531 --> 00:05:24,658
THEY WON'T EVEN
LOOK AT ME.

129
00:05:24,741 --> 00:05:27,119
I'M PERSONA NON GROTTO,

130
00:05:28,537 --> 00:05:29,371
AND IT SUCKS.

131
00:05:29,454 --> 00:05:32,374

00:06:02,654 --> 00:06:04,198
I MEAN,
IT'S UNDERSTANDABLE.

142
00:06:04,281 --> 00:06:06,491
YOU'RE SPINNING
A HUNDRED PLATES AT ONCE.

143
00:06:06,575 --> 00:06:09,828
HEY, MAYBE CIRQUE DU SOLEIL'S

LIBERTY:
MAYBE THIS'LL TEACH YOU

197
00:08:52,741 --> 00:08:54,535
TO KEEP PRIVATE MATTERS
PRIVATE.

198
00:08:59,998 --> 00:09:01,625
YOU STILL HAVE
TO PAY FOR THAT.

199
00:09:06,797 --> 00:09:09,132
I'VE CALLED.
I'VE EMAILED.

200
00:09:09,216 --> 00:09:10,175
IF I GIVE YOU A LIFT,

201
00:09:10,259 --> 00:09:12,761
WILL YOU TAKE THAT

206
00:09:23,272 --> 00:09:25,065
IT WAS STUPID.

207
00:09:25,148 --> 00:09:27,401
I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU'RE MAKING
SUCH A BIG DEAL OUT OF THIS?

208
00:09:27,484 --> 00:09:29,403
BECAUSE YOU TALK
WITHOUT THINKING.

209
00:09:29,486 --> 00:09:31,113
YOU'RE IMMATURE.
YOU'RE A CLOWN.

210
00:09:31,196 --> 00:09:33,866

238
00:10:42,392 --> 00:10:43,602

A BIGGER PROBLEM THAN
LIBERTY BEING PREGNANT?

354
00:17:16,537 --> 00:17:17,371
YEAH, HER.

355
00:17:17,454 --> 00:17:18,664
LIBERTY.

356
00:17:20,499 --> 00:17:22,167
EVERYTHING SHE USED
TO LIKE ABOUT ME?

357
00:17:22,251 --> 00:17:24,336
SHE NOW HATES.

358
00:17:24,419 --> 00:17:26,088
I MEAN, SHE TREATS ME
LIKE CRAP, TOBES.

359
00:17:28,715 --> 00:17:30,175
UM...
JUST TALK TO HER.

360
00:17:30,259 --> 00:17:31,176
TELL HER TO QUIT IT.

361
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:33,679
DOESN'T WORK.
NOTHING WORKS.

362
00:17:35,264 --> 00:17:37,599
WHAT AM I GOING
TO DO?

363
00:17:42,271 --> 00:17:44,231
CORNER TABLE.
NICE.

364
00:17:44,314 --> 00:17:47,818
YEAH, IT'S ONE OF THE PERKS
OF WORKING HERE.

365
00:17:47,901 --> 00:17:50,279
HERE.
MADE SOMETHING FOR YOU.

366
00:17:50,362 --> 00:17:52,865
HMM. GREEN DAY,
MISSY E.,

367
00:17:53,991 --> 00:17:55,367
UH... ARCADE FIRE?

368
00:17:55,450 --> 00:17:58,120
COOL.
NOT WHAT I EXPECTED.

369
00:17:58,704 --> 00:17:59,329
YOUR TURN.

370
00:17:59,413 --> 00:18:00,998
TELL ME SOMETHING
ABOUT YOURSELF

371
00:18:01,081 --> 00:18:02,541
THAT I WOULDN'T
EXPECT.

372
00:18:02,624 --> 00:18:03,417
ALL RIGHT.

373
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:07,462
THIS GOES RIGHT
IN THE VAULT, RIGHT?

374
00:18:08,130 --> 00:18:10,966
YOU KNOW THOSE LITTLE
MR. HANDSOME CONTESTS?

375
00:18:11,049 --> 00:18:13,552
BEAUTY PAGEANTS FOR BOYS?

376
00:18:13,635 --> 00:18:15,721
YOU ARE LOOKING
AT LITTLE MR. HANDSOME,

377
00:18:15,804 --> 00:18:17,890
AGE FOUR THROUGH SIX.

378
00:18:17,973 --> 00:18:19,433
(LAUGHS)

379
00:18:19,516 --> 00:18:21,935
SO, WHAT HAPPENED
AFTER SIX?

380
00:18:22,019 --> 00:18:23,395
GOT UGLY, I GUESS.

381
00:18:23,478 --> 00:18:24,646
(LAUGHS)

382
00:18:27,858 --> 00:18:29,651
JIMMY:
JUST A HEADS UP?

383
00:18:29,735 --> 00:18:31,737
YOU SHOULD BE CAREFUL
WITH THIS GUY.

384
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:32,905
HE'S DANGEROUS,
YOU KNOW.

385
00:18:32,988 --> 00:18:33,989
JIMMY-

386
00:18:35,157 --> 00:18:37,492
HE TENDS TO GET
PEOPLE SHOT.

387
00:18:38,202 --> 00:18:39,953
THAT'S NO GOOD.

388
00:18:40,662 --> 00:18:43,498
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT HE TOLD YOU BUT...

389
00:18:43,999 --> 00:18:45,959
I DOUBT IT'S THE TRUTH.

390
00:18:53,884 --> 00:18:55,177
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

391
00:18:58,805 --> 00:19:00,974
I'M GOING TO
ASK YOU THIS:

392
00:19:01,058 --> 00:19:02,684
CAN I DO THE MORNING
ANNOUNCEMENTS?

393
00:19:02,768 --> 00:19:03,519
NO.

394
00:19:05,229 --> 00:19:06,605
OKAY.
I'M GONNA ASK AGAIN.

395
00:19:06,688 --> 00:19:09,191
JT, WE'RE NOT TALKING
ABOUT THIS.

396
00:19:09,274 --> 00:19:10,776
LIBERTY, IF WE CAN'T TALK
ABOUT THIS,

397
00:19:10,859 --> 00:19:12,110
THEN HOW ARE WE GONNA DEAL
WITH THE FACT

398
00:19:12,194 --> 00:19:12,903
THAT YOU'RE PREGNANT?

399
00:19:12,986 --> 00:19:15,030
WE'RE NOT;
I AM.

400
00:19:15,113 --> 00:19:16,406
OH, THAT'S GOOD TO KNOW.

401
00:19:16,490 --> 00:19:18,450
JUST LIKE YOU
TO MAKE A JOKE.

402
00:19:18,534 --> 00:19:20,160
THAT'S WHAT YOU USED
TO LIKE ABOUT ME, REMEMBER?

403
00:19:20,244 --> 00:19:21,370
IS THAT I MAKE JOKES?

404
00:19:21,453 --> 00:19:23,372
YEAH, WELL,
EVERYTHING'S CHANGED.

405
00:19:23,455 --> 00:19:24,623
I DON'T HAVE TIME
FOR JOKES.

406
00:19:24,706 --> 00:19:26,542
THIS IS SERIOUS.

407
00:19:27,543 --> 00:19:30,128
I CAN'T TRUST YOU
TO DEAL WITH THIS.

408
00:19:30,212 --> 00:19:30,754
FINE.

409
00:19:30,838 --> 00:19:32,673
THEN I CAN'T DEAL
WITH YOU.

410
00:19:32,756 --> 00:19:35,717
THAT'S IT, LIBERTY.
I'M DONE.

411
00:19:38,595 --> 00:19:40,889
YOU'RE BREAKING UP
WITH ME?

412
00:19:42,891 --> 00:19:43,225
NOW?

413
00:19:54,570 --> 00:19:57,197
LOOK, WHATEVER
YOU HAVE TO SAY,

414
00:19:57,281 --> 00:19:59,992
I'VE HEARD IT ALL BEFORE,
OKAY? SO...

415
00:20:00,075 --> 00:20:01,326
YOU DON'T HAVE
TO BOTHER.

416
00:20:01,410 --> 00:20:03,579
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME
THE WHOLE STORY?

417
00:20:03,662 --> 00:20:04,705
SPINNER:
BECAUSE...

418
00:20:04,788 --> 00:20:06,373
JIMMY WAS MY BEST FRIEND.

419
00:20:06,456 --> 00:20:08,166
I BASICALLY CUT
HIS LEGS OFF.

420
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:09,418
I DON'T LIKE
TO BROADCAST THAT.

421
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:12,337
YOU DIDN'T SHOOT HIM.

422
00:20:12,421 --> 00:20:14,423
NO,
BUT I MIGHT AS WELL HAVE.

423
00:20:14,506 --> 00:20:16,925
IT WAS TOTALLY MY FAULT.

424
00:20:17,009 --> 00:20:18,677
I KEEP TRYING
TO TALK TO HIM BUT...

425
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:20,596
YOU CAN'T MAKE
JIMMY FORGIVE YOU,

426
00:20:20,679 --> 00:20:22,848
ESPECIALLY IF YOU HAVEN'T
FORGIVEN YOURSELF.

427
00:20:22,931 --> 00:20:24,850
YEAH, I GET IT.
FRIENDSHIP CLUB.

428
00:20:24,933 --> 00:20:26,977
RIGHT?
BLAH BLAH BLAH.

429
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:29,438
NO,
I'M TALKING ABOUT YOU.

430
00:20:29,521 --> 00:20:31,607
BECAUSE I LIKE YOU.

431
00:20:39,239 --> 00:20:40,157
HERE...

432
00:20:40,949 --> 00:20:45,037
IF YOU STILL WANT
TO GET TO KNOW ME BETTER.

433
00:20:47,247 --> 00:20:48,415
LIBERTY?

434
00:20:50,709 --> 00:20:53,712
I GOT A JOB...
AT A DRUG STORE.

435
00:20:53,795 --> 00:20:54,880
YOU DID?

436
00:20:54,963 --> 00:20:57,216
SO NOT ONLY WILL I BE ABLE
TO SHARE THE COSTS,

437
00:20:57,299 --> 00:20:58,592
BUT WHEN THE BABY COMES,

438
00:20:58,675 --> 00:21:00,969
I'LL GET A PRETTY GOOD DISCOUNT
ON DIAPERS, TOO.

439
00:21:01,053 --> 00:21:02,846
WHY DID YOU DO THAT?

440
00:21:02,930 --> 00:21:04,097
BECAUSE...

441
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:06,391
I WANT TO HELP.

442
00:21:07,309 --> 00:21:10,604
AND IT'S THE ONLY WAY
I KNOW HOW.

443
00:21:12,606 --> 00:21:13,941
AND I DIDN'T NEED
YOUR PERMISSION.

444
00:21:14,024 --> 00:21:16,318
THAT WAS A PLUS,
TOO.

445
00:21:17,319 --> 00:21:18,195
WE'RE NOT BACK TOGETHER.

446
00:21:18,278 --> 00:21:19,571
I KNOW.

447
00:21:19,571 --> 00:21:21,823
BUT I'M NOT GONNA
ABANDON YOU,

448
00:21:24,535 --> 00:21:26,662
AND I'M NOT GONNA
ABANDON THIS BABY.

449
00:21:29,998 --> 00:21:30,791
I'VE NEVER-

450
00:21:30,874 --> 00:21:33,335
NEVER NEEDED HELP
ON ANYTHING.
