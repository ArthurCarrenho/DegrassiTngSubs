00:08:34,056 --> 00:08:37,518
EVERYBODY WHO GRADUATES
FROM THERE DOES WELL.

181
00:08:37,601 --> 00:08:40,479
AND I WAS THINKING THAT,

182
00:08:40,562 --> 00:08:44,274
WITH ME MOVING TO KINGSTON
FOR SCHOOL...

183
00:08:44,942 --> 00:08:48,237
MAYBE YOU'D CONSIDER
MOVING, TOO?

184
00:08:48,987 --> 00:08:51,782

188
00:08:57,955 --> 00:09:00,874
BUT MY LIFE'S
JUST NOT SET.

189
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:02,459
I'M RE-EVALUATING THINGS.

190
00:09:02,543 --> 00:09:04,211
YOU'LL FIGURE IT OUT.

191
00:09:04,294 --> 00:09:07,548

BUT YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW
THE QUESTIONS.

195
00:09:15,597 --> 00:09:18,183
I HAVE A BUDDY

198
00:09:29,653 --> 00:09:32,114
DO I GET TO SEE YOU?

199
00:09:32,197 --> 00:09:35,701

I-I FEEL LIKE SUCH A JERK.

200
00:09:36,493 --> 00:09:37,494

HUH?

357
00:17:48,986 --> 00:17:50,362
DEFINITELY.

358
00:17:51,655 --> 00:17:53,824
LOTS AND LOTS OF MOM.

359
00:17:55,158 --> 00:17:56,952
SO THIS FAIR...

360
00:17:57,035 --> 00:18:00,455
DID YOU FIND IT
AT ALL HELPFUL?

361
00:18:00,539 --> 00:18:01,957
NOT REALLY.

362
00:18:03,041 --> 00:18:03,709
YOU DIDN'T FIND

363
00:18:03,792 --> 00:18:05,794
ANY OF THE UNIVERSITIES HERE
INTERESTING?

364
00:18:05,878 --> 00:18:07,379
INTERESTING.

365
00:18:08,130 --> 00:18:11,175
THAT'S AN INTERESTING
QUESTION.

366
00:18:12,968 --> 00:18:15,304
WERE THEY INTERESTING?

367
00:18:17,181 --> 00:18:18,015
WOW...

368
00:18:19,099 --> 00:18:20,934
WHO'S TO SAY?

369
00:18:27,733 --> 00:18:29,484
WHY BANTING?

370
00:18:29,568 --> 00:18:33,947
WELL, YOU'RE THE-
THE HARVARD OF THE NORTH.

371
00:18:34,031 --> 00:18:36,909
I MEAN, NOT YOU,
MS. MYERS.

372
00:18:36,992 --> 00:18:37,618
ELIZABETH. LIZ.

373
00:18:37,701 --> 00:18:39,369
BUT BANTING,
I MEAN.

374
00:18:40,495 --> 00:18:43,624
ELIZABETH:
BANTING HAS A CACHE, YES.

375
00:18:43,707 --> 00:18:48,295
BUT WHAT ALSO ATTRACTS YOU
TO OUR UNIVERSITY?

376
00:18:48,378 --> 00:18:49,338
WELL...

377
00:18:51,089 --> 00:18:52,925
IT'S VERY GREEN.

378
00:18:55,928 --> 00:18:57,596
SORRY, PAIGE,

379
00:18:59,223 --> 00:19:02,309
I FEEL I HAVE
TO ASK YOU THIS.

380
00:19:02,392 --> 00:19:05,020
WHY DO YOU WANT TO PURSUE
A CAREER IN BUSINESS?

381
00:19:07,564 --> 00:19:09,358
I HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO IDEA.

382
00:19:14,196 --> 00:19:18,325
AND I AM SO HIGH.

383
00:19:25,082 --> 00:19:26,250
(LAUGHING)

384
00:19:28,877 --> 00:19:31,296
DEREK:
WHOA! DUDE, STOP!

385
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:32,714
WAS THAT A FLUKE?

386
00:19:32,798 --> 00:19:35,008
PLEASE, TELL ME
THAT WAS A FLUKE.

387
00:19:35,092 --> 00:19:36,385
ARE WE TALKING
ABOUT ME

388
00:19:36,468 --> 00:19:38,011
SINKING IT
FROM THE TEN SECOND LINE?

389
00:19:38,095 --> 00:19:39,513
AND NOT JUST THAT.

390
00:19:39,596 --> 00:19:41,348
FOUR - IN A ROW.

391
00:19:42,558 --> 00:19:45,185
FROM A CHAIR,
WITH NO JUMP.

392
00:19:45,269 --> 00:19:45,936
TRY 12.

393
00:19:47,396 --> 00:19:49,565
I'VE DONE 12 IN A ROW
FROM A CHAIR

394
00:19:49,648 --> 00:19:50,732
WITH NO JUMP.

395
00:19:52,693 --> 00:19:55,696
LOOK, YOU GOTTA
TEACH ME THAT.

396
00:19:57,447 --> 00:19:58,866
COME ON.

397
00:19:58,949 --> 00:19:59,908
OKAY.

398
00:20:00,576 --> 00:20:02,703
BUT WHEN YOU'RE SHOWING OFF
FOR YOUR FRIENDS -

399
00:20:02,786 --> 00:20:04,621
AND I KNOW YOU WILL -

400
00:20:04,705 --> 00:20:06,957
TELL THEM YOU LEARNED IT
FROM YOUR COACH,

401
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:08,166
NOT THE GUY
WHO GOT SHOT.

402
00:20:10,961 --> 00:20:12,379
YOU GOT IT.

403
00:20:20,387 --> 00:20:24,057
STIR THE POPCORN
AND DON'T TALK TO ME.

404
00:20:24,975 --> 00:20:26,727
IF IT'S ANY COMPENSATION,

405
00:20:26,810 --> 00:20:30,230
MY MOM'S BESTEST FRIEND
IS ALSO HER INFORMANT.

406
00:20:30,314 --> 00:20:33,233
AND I'M GROUNDED
UNTIL I DIE.

407
00:20:33,317 --> 00:20:35,485
OR GO TO UNIVERSITY.

408
00:20:37,112 --> 00:20:39,156
YOUR PARTY TO CELEBRATE
MY DEMISE

409
00:20:39,239 --> 00:20:40,240
CAN COMMENCE NOW.

410
00:20:41,074 --> 00:20:43,035
WHAT HAPPENED TO
THE YOU-NOT-TALKING IDEA I HAD?

411
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:47,080
I WAS A TOAD TO YOU.

412
00:20:47,164 --> 00:20:49,833
A WARTY, BUMPY,

413
00:20:49,917 --> 00:20:51,502
GREEN-SKINNED
HORNY TOAD.

414
00:20:55,088 --> 00:20:56,006
BUT YOU WERE RIGHT.

415
00:20:57,007 --> 00:20:58,634
NO, I WASN'T.

416
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:00,761
I'M NOT.

417
00:21:00,844 --> 00:21:01,470
ALEX.

418
00:21:01,553 --> 00:21:04,473
PAIGE, I DON'T HAVE
A FUTURE, OKAY?

419
00:21:04,556 --> 00:21:07,100
I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHERE
I'M SLEEPING TONIGHT.

420
00:21:07,184 --> 00:21:09,311
THE WAY MY MOM
AND HER STUPID BOYFRIEND FIGHT,

421
00:21:09,394 --> 00:21:10,103
I MIGHT BE AT HOME

422
00:21:10,187 --> 00:21:12,898
OR I MIGHT BE
AT A WOMEN'S SHELTER.

423
00:21:12,981 --> 00:21:13,982
SO HOW AM I SUPPOSED
TO PLAN

424
00:21:14,066 --> 00:21:17,819
FOR SOMETHING LIKE
UNIVERSITY?

425
00:21:17,903 --> 00:21:18,904
NO.

426
00:21:18,987 --> 00:21:21,198
I'M WEARING THIS
THE REST OF MY LIFE.

427
00:21:23,575 --> 00:21:25,035
YOU'RE NOT.

428
00:21:25,118 --> 00:21:26,787
ODDS ARE I AM.

429
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:31,583
WELL, GOOD TO KNOW.

430
00:21:32,668 --> 00:21:35,921
THAT'S TWO OF US
WHO ARE SCARED.
