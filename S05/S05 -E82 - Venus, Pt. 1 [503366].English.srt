00:00:01,418 --> 00:00:04,004
PETER:
ONE, TWO, THREE... ACTION!

2
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:12,387
DO YOU THINK THAT AGENT
IS EVER GONNA CALL ME?

3
00:00:12,471 --> 00:00:14,640
DO YOU THINK THAT PETER GUY
IS EVER GONNA NOTICE ME?

4
00:00:14,723 --> 00:00:17,226
WE'VE BEEN COMING HERE
FOR WEEKS.

5
00:00:17,309 --> 00:00:18,852
OKAY.
WHAT IF I STOOD UP?

6
00:00:18,936 --> 00:00:19,144
DO I HAVE, LIKE,

00:00:19,228 --> 00:00:20,812
LUMPY CHAIR DENTS
IN MY THIGHS?

8
00:00:20,896 --> 00:00:21,355
ALL RIGHT,

9
00:00:21,438 --> 00:00:24,066
YOU'D NEED FAT

10
00:00:24,149 --> 00:00:28,153
EMMA:
LOOK. HE'S TALKING TO THAT
TURQUOISE TANKINI TRAMP.

11
00:00:28,237 --> 00:00:29,613
I HATE HER.

12
00:00:30,572 --> 00:00:31,281
YOU'VE ALREADY WON.

13
00:00:31,365 --> 00:00:32,366
YOU DON'T NEED
A TANKINI

14
00:00:32,449 --> 00:00:33,700
TO HIDE
YOUR BUDDHA BELLY

15
00:00:33,784 --> 00:00:35,244
OR SHORTS TO CAMOUFLAGE
YOUR BUTT.

16
00:00:38,914 --> 00:00:40,207
EMMA:
MANNY...

17
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:41,542
HE'S LOOKING AT YOU.

18
00:00:41,625 --> 00:00:42,668
MANNY:

19
00:00:42,751 --> 00:00:43,210
I'M NOT HIS TYPE.

20
00:00:43,293 --> 00:00:45,587
HE'S LOOKING AT YOU -
YOU ARE.

21
00:00:45,671 --> 00:00:46,672
THAT IS THE FIRST GUY
I'VE LIKED

22
00:00:46,755 --> 00:00:48,340
SINCE HURRICANE SEAN

23
00:00:48,423 --> 00:00:50,592
BLEW THROUGH
MY EMOTIONAL TRAILER PARK.

24
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:54,054

00:02:05,876 --> 00:02:06,710
HEY!

51
00:02:09,713 --> 00:02:10,756
SHE'S A BIG AGENT.

52
00:02:10,839 --> 00:02:12,466
SHE'S PROBABLY

00:02:12,549 --> 00:02:14,301
JT:
TRUST PAPA SUPAFRY,
OKAY?

54
00:02:14,384 --> 00:02:16,803
THE ACTING WORLD
IS ALL ABOUT BRUTAL REJECTION.

55
00:02:16,887 --> 00:02:18,972
HATZILAKOS:
YOU PUT IN A LOT OF WORK
THIS SUMMER,

56
00:02:19,056 --> 00:02:21,308
AND THAT'S WHY
I'M LETTING YOU BACK.

57
00:02:21,391 --> 00:02:24,311
BUT ONE SLIP-UP,

58
00:02:24,394 --> 00:02:25,103

MALE VOICE OVER P.A.:
CAN I HAVE YOUR ATTENTION,
PLEASE.

63
00:02:30,901 --> 00:02:33,820
A SET OF KEYS WAS FOUND
UNDER THE BLEACHERS IN THE GYM.

64
00:02:33,904 --> 00:02:35,531
IF YOU'VE LOST YOUR KEYS...

65
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,451
SPINNER:

66
00:02:39,535 --> 00:02:40,160

00:03:03,225 --> 00:03:03,600
YOU CAN DO IT.

73
00:03:03,684 --> 00:03:04,977
UH, I'M TOO NERVOUS!

74
00:03:08,897 --> 00:03:10,274
(LAUGH) HI.

75
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:12,901
WELCOME TO EMMA,
I'M DEGRASSI.

76
00:03:12,985 --> 00:03:15,946
NICE TO MEET YOU,
DEGRASSI.

77
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:18,323
MANNY:
IT'S A TRADITION -
BACKWARDS GREETING.

78
00:03:18,407 --> 00:03:19,032

00:03:21,243 --> 00:03:21,743

81
00:03:22,536 --> 00:03:22,953
I KNOW YOU.

82
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:25,038
YOU'RE THE ACTRESS

00:03:25,664 --> 00:03:26,456

00:03:27,708 --> 00:03:30,377
I'M A DIRECTOR.
WELL, ASPIRING, ANYWAY.

85
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:31,211
YOU GOT AN AGENT?

86
00:03:31,295 --> 00:03:33,964
I SENT MY PHOTOS

87
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:35,215
SHE'S THE BEST

88
00:03:35,299 --> 00:03:36,884

89
00:03:36,967 --> 00:03:37,718
PETER:

90
00:03:37,801 --> 00:03:39,386
THAT'S HOW LONG YOU'RE GONNA
HAVE TO WAIT.

91
00:03:39,469 --> 00:03:40,679
YOU GOTTA MARCH

92
00:03:40,762 --> 00:03:41,555
LOOKING LIKE A MILLION BUCKS,

93
00:03:41,638 --> 00:03:43,515
AND DEMAND TO SEE HER.

94
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:44,600
MY DAD ALWAYS SAYS,

95
00:03:44,683 --> 00:03:46,435
"IF YOU WANT SOMETHING IN LIFE,
DON'T ASK.

96
00:03:46,518 --> 00:03:47,603
JUST TAKE."

97
00:03:47,686 --> 00:03:49,438
(CELL PHONE RINGS)

98
00:03:49,521 --> 00:03:50,355
EXCUSE ME.

99
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,441
HELLO?

100
00:03:53,609 --> 00:03:55,485
ELLIE:
ASHLEY HASN'T EMAILED
IN A WEEK.

101
00:03:55,569 --> 00:03:57,571
SHE'S TOTALLY DISAPPEARED.

102
00:03:57,654 --> 00:03:59,072
MARCO:
OKAY... UH...

103
00:03:59,156 --> 00:04:01,575
MAYBE-MAYBE-MAYBE

104
00:04:01,658 --> 00:04:03,911
HMM? SHOW UP
AT HIS BIRTHDAY TOMORROW.

105
00:04:03,994 --> 00:04:05,746
IT'S TOMORROW?

106
00:04:05,829 --> 00:04:07,497
WHAT DO WE DO?

107
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:18,008
OH MANUELLITA,
I DIDN'T MAKE LUNCH.

108
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:20,802
I JUST CAME
FOR MY CREDIT CARD.

109
00:04:20,886 --> 00:04:23,889
UH... LEFTOVERS?
OR A TOASTY SANDWICH?

110
00:04:25,557 --> 00:04:27,392
I COULD THROW TOGETHER
AN OMELET.

111
00:04:27,476 --> 00:04:28,644
MOM, IT'S MY CREDIT CARD,

112
00:04:28,727 --> 00:04:29,353
AND I DON'T EVEN KNOW

113
00:04:29,436 --> 00:04:31,813
WHY YOU GUYS DON'T LET ME
KEEP IT.

114
00:04:31,897 --> 00:04:32,564
YOUR DADDY AND I

115
00:04:32,648 --> 00:04:34,650
JUST WANT YOU
TO BE RESPONSIBLE.

116
00:04:34,733 --> 00:04:35,275
I AM!

117
00:04:35,359 --> 00:04:37,027
I WORKED REALLY HARD
ON THE MOVIE

118
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:39,655
TO MAKE ALL THAT MONEY.

119
00:04:39,738 --> 00:04:42,491
SOMETIMES WE ARE CONCERNED.

120
00:04:43,784 --> 00:04:46,578

121
00:04:46,662 --> 00:04:47,996

00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:52,417
WHAT, DO YOU THINK
I'M RETARDED?

I'M NOT!
I CAN MANAGE!

00:04:53,877 --> 00:04:55,212
I'M SMART!

126
00:05:02,553 --> 00:05:03,637

127
00:05:04,471 --> 00:05:05,973
I JUST NEED SOME

00:08:00,272 --> 00:08:01,064
A GLASS OF MILK,
HONEY.

181
00:08:02,733 --> 00:08:03,483
YOU WANT ME TO- ?

182
00:08:03,567 --> 00:08:05,986
BERNICE:
I MEAN, IT'S NICE - MILK.

183
00:08:06,069 --> 00:08:07,863
UH... IT'S KINDA BORING.

184
00:08:07,946 --> 00:08:09,698
DANNY, TAKE A LOOK
AT THE WALL BEHIND ME.

185
00:08:09,781 --> 00:08:10,657
TELL ME WHAT
YOU SEE, DEAR.

186
00:08:12,618 --> 00:08:14,077
A BUNCH OF REALLY
GORGEOUS PEOPLE.

187
00:08:14,828 --> 00:08:15,078
MM-HM.

188
00:08:15,162 --> 00:08:17,164
BUT THEY'RE NOT
JUST GORGEOUS.

189
00:08:17,247 --> 00:08:20,167
THEY'RE SPECIAL.
THEY HAVE "IT".

190
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:22,711
LOOK AT ROBIN.
ROBIN HAS "IT".

191
00:08:22,794 --> 00:08:24,880
ROBIN IS SPECIAL.

192
00:08:24,963 --> 00:08:26,131
WHAT'S SO SPECIAL
ABOUT YOU?

193
00:08:27,799 --> 00:08:28,634
HMM?

194
00:08:30,135 --> 00:08:31,345
EXACTLY MY POINT.

195
00:08:31,428 --> 00:08:33,805
SO, YOU GO FIGURE THAT OUT
BEFORE YOU COME BACK HERE.

196
00:08:34,681 --> 00:08:36,141
OH, AND A WORD OF ADVICE?

197
00:08:36,225 --> 00:08:37,809
STOP WITH THE BEANS AND RICE
AND UH...

198
00:08:37,893 --> 00:08:39,144
DUMP THE LUMPS.

199
00:08:39,770 --> 00:08:40,729
COME.

200
00:08:59,122 --> 00:09:00,332
(HORN BLARES)

201
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:01,083
(SCREAMS)

202
00:09:14,096 --> 00:09:15,347
HI, EMMA?

203
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,308
CAN YOU MEET ME
DOWNTOWN, NOW?

204
00:09:21,854 --> 00:09:24,690
EMMA:
UGH, LOOK AT THAT ASS.

205
00:09:25,983 --> 00:09:28,318
SHE SAID
"DUMP THE LUMPS".

206
00:09:28,402 --> 00:09:31,071
OKAY, SHE'S OUT
OF HER MIND.

207
00:09:31,154 --> 00:09:32,614
AND I'M A GLASS
OF MILK.

208
00:09:32,698 --> 00:09:35,742
OKAY, YOU ARE OUT
YOUR MIND.

209
00:09:35,826 --> 00:09:37,619
MANNY,
YOU ARE GORGEOUS.

210
00:09:37,703 --> 00:09:40,372
YOU DO NOT NEED
TO CHANGE.

211
00:09:41,331 --> 00:09:42,541
REMEMBER WHEN YOU GOT
YOUR PERIOD IN CLASS-

212
00:09:42,624 --> 00:09:43,458
SHH...

213
00:09:45,085 --> 00:09:47,087
REMEMBER WHEN YOU GOT
YOUR PERIOD IN CLASS

214
00:09:47,171 --> 00:09:48,255
AND EVERYONE
WAS LAUGHING AT YOU

215
00:09:48,338 --> 00:09:50,883
AND YOU JUST TOLD THEM ALL
TO SHUT UP?

216
00:09:50,966 --> 00:09:53,677
I FEEL LIKE THAT
EVERY DAY.

217
00:09:55,095 --> 00:09:56,513
LIKE EVERYBODY'S
JOKING ABOUT ME,

218
00:09:56,597 --> 00:09:59,224
AND I CAN NEVER
GET THEM TO SHUT UP.

219
00:09:59,308 --> 00:10:02,978
AND A PLASTIC SURGEON
CAN CHANGE THAT?

220
00:10:03,061 --> 00:10:04,605
THEY WON'T BE LAUGHING
WHEN I'M FAMOUS.

221
00:10:05,689 --> 00:10:07,274
MANNY SANTOS?

222
00:10:11,069 --> 00:10:13,906
SO, SOME OFF MY UH...
THIGHS AND,

223
00:10:15,115 --> 00:10:16,491
MY...

224
00:10:18,493 --> 00:10:18,827
YOUR BOTTOM?

225
00:10:20,495 --> 00:10:22,664
YES, BUT I THINK MY...

226
00:10:24,416 --> 00:10:25,417
BOSOM?

227
00:10:26,126 --> 00:10:27,336
YES, I THINK
THEY'RE FINE

228
00:10:27,419 --> 00:10:31,131
OR... IT -
OR MY BUST -

229
00:10:31,131 --> 00:10:31,882
I THINK IS FINE.

230
00:10:32,966 --> 00:10:34,635
BUT CONSIDER...

231
00:10:34,718 --> 00:10:37,721
A LARGER BUST
WILL ACTUALLY HELP

232
00:10:37,804 --> 00:10:40,224
BALANCE OUT
YOUR LOWER HALF.

233
00:10:40,307 --> 00:10:44,311
SO IF WE COMBINE LIPO
WITH BREAST AUGMENTATION,

234
00:10:44,394 --> 00:10:49,233
I CAN CREATE FOR YOU, MANNY,
A VERY, VERY STRIKING FIGURE.

235
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:51,235
OH, OKAY.

236
00:10:51,318 --> 00:10:54,112
I WANNA DO IT.
LET'S DO IT.

237
00:10:54,196 --> 00:10:54,738
OKAY.

238
00:10:54,821 --> 00:10:57,115
THERE'S SOME DETAILS
THAT WE HAVE TO DISCUSS

239
00:10:57,199 --> 00:10:58,867
INCLUDING THE RISKS,
OF COURSE.

240
00:10:58,951 --> 00:11:00,661
FINE. HOW MUCH?

241
00:11:01,328 --> 00:11:02,871
(LAUGHS) AH WELL...

242
00:11:02,955 --> 00:11:05,165
SIX THOUSAND IS THE AVERAGE
COST OF AN IMPLANT,

243
00:11:05,249 --> 00:11:05,749
PLUS OR MINUS,

244
00:11:05,832 --> 00:11:07,584
DEPENDING ON MODEL,
ET CETERA.

245
00:11:07,668 --> 00:11:10,212
UH... LIPOSUCTION,
MORE OR LESS $3000.

246
00:11:10,295 --> 00:11:11,588
I HAVE ENOUGH.

247
00:11:11,672 --> 00:11:13,048
AND PARENTAL CONSENT?

248
00:11:13,131 --> 00:11:15,425
I HAVE ENOUGH...
OF IT.

249
00:11:15,509 --> 00:11:17,803
I'M SORRY,
I HAVE IT.

250
00:11:17,886 --> 00:11:20,389
AND (AHEM) HOW SOON?

251
00:11:20,472 --> 00:11:23,642
UH, SIX, SEVEN
OR EIGHT WEEKS

252
00:11:23,725 --> 00:11:25,143
UNTIL THERE'S AN OPENING
IN THE O.R.,

253
00:11:25,227 --> 00:11:26,270
BUT THAT'S ONLY
IF YOU BOOK NOW

254
00:11:26,353 --> 00:11:27,688
AND LEAVE A DEPOSIT.
OTHERWISE-

255
00:11:27,771 --> 00:11:30,357
DO YOU TAKE
CREDIT CARDS?

256
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:36,280
HEY, SPINNER.
HAVE ANY COFFEE?

257
00:11:36,363 --> 00:11:38,448
SPINNER:
YEAH, THEY TELL ME
THAT'S WHAT THE CUPS ARE FOR.

258
00:11:38,532 --> 00:11:40,617
ONE TO GO,
PLEASE.

259
00:11:40,701 --> 00:11:42,369
HM... PARTY SUPPLIES, EH?

260
00:11:42,452 --> 00:11:43,871
I KNOW SCHOOL'S EXCITING
BUT...

261
00:11:45,539 --> 00:11:46,540
IT'S CRAIG'S BIRTHDAY.

262
00:11:47,958 --> 00:11:50,252
SO WHAT, YOU GUYS
BEST FRIENDS NOW?

263
00:11:50,335 --> 00:11:51,670
NO, NO...

264
00:11:51,753 --> 00:11:54,298
I JUST...
I KINDA FEEL RESPONSIBLE

265
00:11:54,381 --> 00:11:58,719
SINCE MY FORMER BEST FRIEND'S
RUINED THE GUY'S LIFE.

266
00:11:58,802 --> 00:12:00,721
OOPS,
ASH DID IT AGAIN.

267
00:12:00,804 --> 00:12:01,889
SHE PLAYED
WITH HIS HEART,

268
00:12:01,972 --> 00:12:02,639
GOT LOST-

269
00:12:02,723 --> 00:12:03,348
ANYWAY...

270
00:12:03,432 --> 00:12:04,683
NOW I'VE GOT NO PLACE
TO THROW HIM

271
00:12:04,766 --> 00:12:05,559
HIS CHEER-UP PARTY.

272
00:12:06,768 --> 00:12:08,478
WELL, YOU KNOW I COULD
GET US THAT WHOLE CORNER.

273
00:12:12,608 --> 00:12:13,734
I MEAN YOU.

274
00:12:13,817 --> 00:12:15,569
YOU GUYS CAN HAVE
THAT WHOLE CORNER.

275
00:12:17,571 --> 00:12:18,447
REALLY?

276
00:12:18,530 --> 00:12:19,573
YEAH, THAT'S NO PROBLEM.

277
00:12:19,656 --> 00:12:22,659
I'M HERE FOR
THE NIGHTSHIFT ANYWAY.

278
00:12:31,376 --> 00:12:32,628
CAPTAIN COOK?

279
00:12:32,711 --> 00:12:36,006
DIDN'T WE ALREADY DO HIM
IN LIKE, GRADE FOUR?

280
00:12:36,089 --> 00:12:37,424
PETER:
YEARS LATER,
PETER WAS TO LOOK BACK

281
00:12:37,508 --> 00:12:38,634
AND REMEMBER
HOW CUTE IT WAS

282
00:12:38,717 --> 00:12:42,930
WHEN SHE MADE FUN
OF HIS HISTORY PROJECT.

283
00:12:43,013 --> 00:12:44,139
OKAY, WAIT, WAIT.

284
00:12:44,223 --> 00:12:45,474
I HAVE THIS IDEA
FOR A MOVIE.

285
00:12:45,557 --> 00:12:47,059
IT'S ABOUT A GIRL
LIKE YOU -

286
00:12:47,142 --> 00:12:50,479
SMART, FIERY,
NOT TOTALLY HIDEOUS.

287
00:12:51,772 --> 00:12:54,024
CHARMING, THANKS.
BUT I DUNNO.

288
00:12:54,107 --> 00:12:54,942
WHY NOT?

289
00:12:55,025 --> 00:12:56,151
A GOOD MOVIE
UNDER YOUR BELT?

290
00:12:56,235 --> 00:12:58,195
YOUR AGENT
WOULD LOVE THAT.

291
00:12:58,278 --> 00:12:59,029
YOU DID GO TALK
TO THAT AGENT,

292
00:12:59,112 --> 00:13:00,864
DIDN'T YOU?

293
00:13:00,948 --> 00:13:04,535
YEAH, BUT SHE SAID
I NEED SOME WORK.

294
00:13:04,618 --> 00:13:06,119
SO DO IT.

295
00:13:06,203 --> 00:13:07,746
AND LISTEN TO THIS:

296
00:13:07,829 --> 00:13:09,373
"I HAD THE AMBITION
NOT ONLY TO GO FARTHER

297
00:13:09,456 --> 00:13:10,916
THAN ANY MAN HAD EVER GONE,

298
00:13:10,999 --> 00:13:15,045
BUT TO GO AS FAR
AS IT WAS POSSIBLE TO GO."

299
00:13:15,128 --> 00:13:16,129
YOU FREE TONIGHT?

300
00:13:16,213 --> 00:13:17,631
MY FRIEND'S HAVING
A PARTY.

301
00:13:17,714 --> 00:13:19,800
UM... SORRY,
I CAN'T.

302
00:13:21,635 --> 00:13:22,386
BECAUSE?

303
00:13:22,469 --> 00:13:24,471
MANNY:
JUST BECAUSE BUT...

304
00:13:24,555 --> 00:13:27,391
YOU SHOULD ASK EMMA
IF SHE'S FREE.

305
00:13:28,392 --> 00:13:30,727
I WILL ASK HER
BUT UH...

306
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:35,065
HERE'S THE ADDRESS
FOR YOU -

307
00:13:35,148 --> 00:13:36,775
JUST IN CASE.

308
00:13:45,367 --> 00:13:46,201
I STILL CAN'T BELIEVE
THEY LET HIM BACK

309
00:13:46,285 --> 00:13:47,536
AFTER WHAT HE DID.

310
00:13:47,619 --> 00:13:48,662
IT MAKES ME SICK.

311
00:13:48,745 --> 00:13:51,248
BLAH BLAH, SPINNER.
THAT'S SO LAST YEAR.

312
00:13:51,331 --> 00:13:51,790
I WANT THE LATEST

313
00:13:51,874 --> 00:13:54,042
WITH THE PRINCESS
ASHLEY DIARIES.

314
00:13:54,126 --> 00:13:55,043
HOW'S CRAIG DOING
POST DUMPAGE?

315
00:13:56,003 --> 00:13:57,754
WELL. REALLY WELL.

316
00:13:57,838 --> 00:13:59,673
MARCO:
YEAH, 'CAUSE UM...
HE DOESN'T KNOW YET.

317
00:14:00,299 --> 00:14:00,883
OH.

318
00:14:00,966 --> 00:14:02,259
ELLIE:
HEY, IT'S THE GUY'S BIRTHDAY.

319
00:14:02,342 --> 00:14:05,596
IT CAN AT LEAST WAIT
TILL TOMORROW, RIGHT?

320
00:14:05,679 --> 00:14:06,013
THERE HE IS!

321
00:14:08,307 --> 00:14:09,224
ALL:
SURPRISE!

322
00:14:09,308 --> 00:14:12,561
(CHEERING AND BLOWING
PARTY HORNS)

323
00:14:13,187 --> 00:14:14,730
WHO DID THIS?
I HATE SURPRISES.

324
00:14:14,813 --> 00:14:15,647
(LAUGHING)

325
00:14:19,943 --> 00:14:20,944
EVERYONE:
(LAUGHING)

326
00:14:21,028 --> 00:14:21,361
ELLIE:
HAPPY BIRTHDAY!

327
00:14:21,445 --> 00:14:22,446
CRAIG:
THANK YOU,
THANK YOU!

328
00:14:22,529 --> 00:14:24,198
THIS IS GREAT!

329
00:14:32,372 --> 00:14:33,373
SORRY.

330
00:14:35,709 --> 00:14:37,628
HOW WAS YOUR DAY?

331
00:14:44,426 --> 00:14:45,010
WHAT'S GOING ON?

332
00:14:47,221 --> 00:14:50,307
A DOCTOR'S OFFICE
CALLED TODAY...

333
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:51,266
TO GET PERMISSION...

334
00:14:52,434 --> 00:14:53,519
FOR BREAST SURGERY?!

335
00:14:53,602 --> 00:14:55,229
OKAY. WAIT.

336
00:14:55,312 --> 00:14:57,981
I HAVE TO EXPLAIN.
I WAS JUST... ASKING.

337
00:14:58,065 --> 00:14:59,566
I WAS... CURIOUS-

338
00:14:59,650 --> 00:15:01,151
JOSEPH:
DON'T LIE!

339
00:15:02,444 --> 00:15:04,446
YOU MADE A DEPOSIT!

340
00:15:04,530 --> 00:15:07,241
I CALLED THE CREDIT CARD
COMPANY.

341
00:15:09,117 --> 00:15:11,411
I'M TRYING TO BE
AN ACTRESS.

342
00:15:11,495 --> 00:15:14,414
I NEED TO MAKE CHANGES -
FOR MY JOB.

343
00:15:14,498 --> 00:15:16,708
SCHOOL'S YOUR JOB.

344
00:15:16,792 --> 00:15:17,501
AND THE ONLY CHANGING
YOU SHOULD DO

345
00:15:17,584 --> 00:15:20,254
IS INTO-
INTO DECENT CLOTHES.

346
00:15:20,337 --> 00:15:22,506
MY CLOTHES ARE FINE.

347
00:15:24,258 --> 00:15:27,886
DO YOU THINK I SACRIFICED
ALL MY LIFE

348
00:15:28,554 --> 00:15:31,139
SO YOU COULD BE
A LOOSE GIRL?

349
00:15:31,223 --> 00:15:32,349
I'M NOT A LOOSE GIRL!

350
00:15:32,432 --> 00:15:34,434
THEN WHY YOU WANT
BIGGER BOOBS, HUH?

351
00:15:34,518 --> 00:15:35,352
HUH?

352
00:15:35,978 --> 00:15:37,354
WHAT KIND OF GIRL
WANTS THAT?

353
00:15:37,437 --> 00:15:39,273
A GOOD GIRL?
NO!

354
00:15:41,525 --> 00:15:43,026
ONLY A SLUT.

355
00:15:52,411 --> 00:15:54,955
JULIETTA:
MANUELLA! WAIT!

356
00:15:56,373 --> 00:15:56,957
