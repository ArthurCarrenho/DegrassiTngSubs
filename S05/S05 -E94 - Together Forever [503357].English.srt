MR. DAVIES, PLEASE...

359
00:14:38,545 --> 00:14:40,005
I'M NEW,
BUT I'M DEDICATED.

360
00:14:40,088 --> 00:14:41,215
I'LL PRACTICE
ALL NIGHT.

361
00:14:41,965 --> 00:14:44,384
HONEY, YOU'RE NOT
CUT OUT FOR THIS.

362
00:14:44,468 --> 00:14:46,553
JUST LIKE I'M NOT CUT OUT
TO FLY AIRPLANES.

363
00:14:47,137 --> 00:14:49,139
THEM'S THE BREAKS.

364
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:51,391
I HOPE TORONTO HAS A LOT
OF GREAT SINGERS, TOO.

365
00:14:56,230 --> 00:14:56,688
OKAY.

366
00:15:28,136 --> 00:15:29,721
LIBERTY:
ET TU, TO-BAY?

367
00:15:29,805 --> 00:15:30,973
(PAINED GROAN)

368
00:15:31,765 --> 00:15:32,391
SO...

369
00:15:32,474 --> 00:15:35,102
YOU USED MY PREGNANCY
TO STAGE A COUP D'ETAT?

370
00:15:35,185 --> 00:15:36,186
NICE.

371
00:15:36,687 --> 00:15:38,063
LIBERTY, THAT'S NOT
WHAT HAPPENED.

372
00:15:38,146 --> 00:15:39,273
REALLY.

373
00:15:39,356 --> 00:15:42,943
THEN WHO WENT
TO MS. HATZILAKOS, HMM?

374
00:15:44,528 --> 00:15:45,571
OKAY, IT WAS ME.

375
00:15:45,654 --> 00:15:46,780
I'M THE BLABBER.

376
00:15:46,864 --> 00:15:49,074
TOBY "THE BLABBER" ISAACS.

377
00:15:49,157 --> 00:15:49,992
THAT'S ME.

378
00:15:50,576 --> 00:15:53,662
BUT LIBERTY,
IF I WAS PREGNANT?

379
00:15:53,745 --> 00:15:54,162
AND, YOU KNOW,

380
00:15:54,246 --> 00:15:56,164
MY DOCTOR TOLD ME
TO SLOW DOWN?

381
00:15:56,248 --> 00:15:56,957
THAT'S WHAT I'D BE DOING
RIGHT NOW.

382
00:15:58,584 --> 00:16:00,335
YEAH...
WHATEVER, TOBES.

383
00:16:01,211 --> 00:16:02,838
I'M GOING TO THE ASSEMBLY

384
00:16:02,921 --> 00:16:05,257
AND YOU'RE DRIVING ME.

385
00:16:09,761 --> 00:16:12,139
(ENGINE RATTLES
AND BACKFIRES)

386
00:16:15,517 --> 00:16:17,644
(ENGINE DIES)

387
00:16:18,437 --> 00:16:20,814
UH...
THIS ISN'T CARSON HILL.

388
00:16:20,898 --> 00:16:22,524
YEAH.
I KNOW.

389
00:16:22,608 --> 00:16:25,986
BUT MY BUBBIE'S CAR
DOESN'T SEEM TO GET THAT.

390
00:16:26,069 --> 00:16:27,404
I'M CALLING A CAB.

391
00:16:27,487 --> 00:16:30,115
DON'T EXPECT A RIDE
BECAUSE TRAITORS HAVE TO WALK.

392
00:16:30,199 --> 00:16:31,909
I'M NOT A TRAITOR.

393
00:16:31,992 --> 00:16:34,411
YOU ATTEMPTED TO OUST ME
FROM MY PRESIDENCY.

394
00:16:34,494 --> 00:16:36,538
YOU,
TRAITOROUS YOU.

395
00:16:36,622 --> 00:16:40,125
LOOK, I DON'T WANT
YOUR STUPID JOB.

396
00:16:40,834 --> 00:16:42,377
SO WHY BLAB
TO HATZILAKOS?

397
00:16:42,461 --> 00:16:44,046
I DIDN'T.
I BLABBED TO JT,

398
00:16:44,129 --> 00:16:46,381
AND JT BLABBED TO HATZILAKOS.

399
00:16:46,465 --> 00:16:48,217
BECAUSE THIS WHOLE TIME
I'VE BEEN TRYING TO HELP HIM

400
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:49,301
KEEP UP WITH YOU.

401
00:16:49,384 --> 00:16:50,135
WHILE AT THE SAME TIME

402
00:16:50,219 --> 00:16:52,638
HELP YOU GET READY
FOR THIS STUPID CONFERENCE.

403
00:16:52,721 --> 00:16:54,640
BUT THE ONLY PERSON I HELPED
WAS MYSELF -

404
00:16:54,723 --> 00:16:56,475
ACHIEVE INSANITY!

405
00:16:56,558 --> 00:16:57,559
COME ON...
(HITS STEERING WHEEL)

406
00:16:57,643 --> 00:16:59,520
LIBERTY:
THERE'S A REASON
I DON'T TELL JT

407
00:16:59,603 --> 00:17:00,646
ABOUT ANY OF THIS.

408
00:17:00,646 --> 00:17:02,606
HE- (GASPS)

409
00:17:05,234 --> 00:17:05,901
LIBERTY?

410
00:17:07,110 --> 00:17:08,946
OH, THAT'S DISGUSTING.

411
00:17:09,029 --> 00:17:09,530
WHAT?

412
00:17:10,656 --> 00:17:12,157
WHY IS THERE WATER
ON THE FLOOR?

413
00:17:13,325 --> 00:17:15,911
TOBY... IT'S-IT'S TIME.

414
00:17:16,453 --> 00:17:17,746
TOBY:
TI-TIME? T-WHAT?

415
00:17:17,829 --> 00:17:18,580
WHAT TIME?

416
00:17:18,664 --> 00:17:19,957
TIME FOR-

417
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:21,875
NO! NO. NO.
NOT HERE.

418
00:17:22,584 --> 00:17:24,336
NOT IN MY BUBBIE'S CAR!

419
00:17:25,170 --> 00:17:26,338
DIAL 9-1-1.

420
00:17:26,421 --> 00:17:28,507
BUT DON'T MAKE A BIG DEAL
ABOUT IT.

421
00:17:29,258 --> 00:17:31,260
(INDISTINCT VOICES

422

LIBERTY:
TOBY, I'M SORRY.

424
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:35,764
TOBY:
IT'S OKAY.

425
00:17:35,848 --> 00:17:37,140
YOU'RE GONNA BE FINE.
DON'T WORRY.

426
00:17:37,224 --> 00:17:37,891
BUT THE ASSEMBLY-

427
00:17:37,975 --> 00:17:40,477
IT DOESN'T MATTER,
OKAY?

428
00:17:47,276 --> 00:18:00,330
♪♪♪

429
00:18:00,414 --> 00:18:02,040
NEW SONG?

430
00:18:02,124 --> 00:18:03,584
I LIKE IT.
JUST LIKE THAT.

431
00:18:03,667 --> 00:18:06,587
YOU KNOW, IT DOESN'T
EVEN NEED LYRICS.

432
00:18:06,670 --> 00:18:08,630
IT'S NOT REALLY
A SONG THEN, IS IT?

433
00:18:08,714 --> 00:18:11,466
SOMETIMES YOU DON'T NEED
ALL THE EXTRA STUFF.

434
00:18:11,550 --> 00:18:14,386
SOMETIMES SIMPLER
IS BETTER.

435
00:18:15,596 --> 00:18:16,972
I'M NOT A SOLO ACT.

436
00:18:17,055 --> 00:18:18,307
BUT YOU COULD BE.

437
00:18:18,390 --> 00:18:20,434
I DON'T CARE.
THIS ISN'T ABOUT ME.

438
00:18:20,517 --> 00:18:22,436
THIS IS ABOUT THE BAND.

439
00:18:24,521 --> 00:18:27,608
ELLIE, WE WERE GONNA
DO THIS TOGETHER.

440
00:18:27,691 --> 00:18:28,859
CUT OUR ALBUM,

441

444
00:18:34,072 --> 00:18:35,407
YES, YOU CAN.

445
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:37,284
NO, I CAN'T.

446
00:18:37,367 --> 00:18:38,660

BETTER ON BASS,

447

JUST LIKE THIS -
YOU AND YOUR GUITAR.

454

I REALLY THINK
YOU COULD WIN.

455
00:18:59,932 --> 00:19:00,307
OKAY.

456
00:19:01,892 --> 00:19:03,519
LET'S SAY I DO PLAY
THE SHOWCASE,

457
00:19:03,602 --> 00:19:04,645
AND I DO WIN.

458
00:19:05,437 --> 00:19:07,189
THAT MEANS LEAVING.

459
00:19:07,272 --> 00:19:09,525
