00:00:11,386 --> 00:00:14,056
SOMEONE'S ALWAYS

00:00:14,139 --> 00:00:15,891
SO WHAT DO YOU THINK?

6
00:00:15,974 --> 00:00:17,893

YOU'RE WEARING A BIKINI
TO FRIENDSHIP CLUB?

8
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:22,314
YOU'RE GONNA GIVE POOR
BABY JESUS A HEART ATTACK.

9
00:00:22,397 --> 00:00:24,775
YOU KNOW YOU SHOULDN'T
TALK LIKE THAT.

BUT, YOU KNOW, IF WE ACCEPT
JESUS INTO OUR HEARTS,

52
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:17,095
WE'LL BE FREE.

53
00:02:17,638 --> 00:02:18,931
BUT... WAIT A SEC,

54
00:02:19,014 --> 00:02:21,642
IF WE'RE ALL SINNERS
THEN WHAT CAN JESUS DO?

55
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:24,019
HE CAN FORGIVE YOU.

56
00:02:24,102 --> 00:02:25,479
EXACTLY.
AND YOU KNOW, THAT WAY,

57
00:02:25,562 --> 00:02:26,980
YOU'LL GAIN ENTRANCE
TO HEAVEN.

58
00:02:27,064 --> 00:02:28,732
YEAH, BUT THERE ARE
GOOD PEOPLE OUT THERE

59
00:02:28,815 --> 00:02:30,150
WHO DON'T BELIEVE IN JESUS.

60
00:02:30,234 --> 00:02:31,777
WHAT?
DO THEY JUST GO TO HELL?

61
00:02:32,736 --> 00:02:34,780
(SCHOOL BELL RINGS)

62
00:02:37,658 --> 00:02:39,743
LINUS:
LISTEN SPINNER,
THAT WAS A GREAT DEBATE.

63
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:41,328
I'M LOOKING FORWARD

00:02:41,411 --> 00:02:43,830

I HAVE PLANS TO WORSHIP

00:02:49,086 --> 00:02:50,045
THAT'S GREAT!

68
00:02:50,128 --> 00:02:51,463
IS YOUR FRIEND

00:02:52,589 --> 00:02:54,550
YEAH, HE BELIEVES
IN THINGS...

70
00:02:54,633 --> 00:02:55,968
LIKE BEER.

71
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:02,558
I COME BEARING
MORNING BAGELS.

72
00:03:02,641 --> 00:03:03,350
I'VE GOT OUR COFFEES.

73
00:03:03,433 --> 00:03:05,686
TWO CREAMS FOR YOU,
TWO SUGARS FOR ME.

74
00:03:05,769 --> 00:03:08,480
OKAY, HAZEL,
WHAT'S THE BIG SECRET?

75
00:03:08,564 --> 00:03:10,983
HAZEL:

00:03:18,657 --> 00:03:20,158
WOW, THAT'S...

00:03:23,954 --> 00:03:25,873
ANNOUNCER:
ATTENTION STUDENTS.

83
00:03:25,956 --> 00:03:29,835
HATZILAKOS:
A YEAR AGO TODAY,
TRAGEDY STRUCK DEGRASSI.

84
00:03:29,918 --> 00:03:31,295
AND SINCE THAT DAY,

85
00:03:31,378 --> 00:03:33,881
WE'VE BECOME
A DIFFERENT SCHOOL.

86
00:03:33,964 --> 00:03:36,258
ZERO TOLERANCE FOR BULLYING,

87
00:03:36,341 --> 00:03:40,137
AND AN OPEN DOOR POLICY
FOR STUDENT CONCERNS.

88
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:42,472
WE DID THIS TOGETHER.

89
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:49,021
SPINNER:
HEY JAY, LISTEN...

90
00:03:49,104 --> 00:03:50,731

92
00:03:51,648 --> 00:03:53,650
YEAH. I'M SURPRISED NOBODY'S
FIGURED IT OUT YET.

93
00:03:53,734 --> 00:03:56,069
JIMMY SET THE WHOLE THING UP
PERFECTLY.

94
00:03:56,153 --> 00:03:58,322
RICK:
YOU PRETENDED TO BE MY FRIEND.

95
00:04:01,366 --> 00:04:02,326
AAAHHHHHHH!

96
00:04:13,712 --> 00:04:14,796
HATZILAKOS:
I'D LIKE TO ANNOUNCE

97
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,882
THAT OUT OF THE MANY PROPOSALS
SUBMITTED,

98
00:04:16,965 --> 00:04:18,842
THE WINNER IS...

99
00:04:18,926 --> 00:04:20,302
A NEW MURAL,

100
00:04:20,385 --> 00:04:22,888
TO BE PAINTED BY
JIMMY BROOKS!

101
00:04:23,889 --> 00:04:24,723
(APPLAUSE)

102
00:04:26,183 --> 00:04:27,142
PAIGE:
THAT'S AMAZING.

103
00:04:27,226 --> 00:04:29,311
I DIDN'T KNOW YOU
SUBMITTED A PROPOSAL!

104
00:04:29,394 --> 00:04:32,397
ACTUALLY,
IT'S-IT'S ALL ON ELLIE.

105
00:04:32,481 --> 00:04:33,524
SHE TALKED ME INTO IT.

106
00:04:34,024 --> 00:04:37,152
GEE, ALL THESE PLANS
THAT I DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT.

107
00:04:37,236 --> 00:04:38,695
WELL, JIMMY'S SUCH
A GOOD ARTIST,

108
00:04:38,779 --> 00:04:40,614
AND WITH THE SHOOTING...

109
00:04:40,697 --> 00:04:41,740
WE JUST THOUGHT
IT WAS RIGHT.

110
00:04:43,242 --> 00:04:43,951
CRAIG:
GOOD JOB, MAN.

111
00:04:44,034 --> 00:04:45,118
JIMMY:

113
00:04:47,204 --> 00:04:48,789
SO TELL ME...

114
00:04:48,872 --> 00:04:52,709
WHEN DID JIMMY AND ELLIE
BECOME A "WE"?

115
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,885
CRAIG:
SOMEONE LEFT YOU A CARD.

116
00:05:01,969 --> 00:05:02,803
HOW SWEET.

117
00:05:03,387 --> 00:05:07,224
SPINNER:
IT'S A NOTE, MAN,
FROM MY GIRLFRIEND.

118
00:05:07,891 --> 00:05:08,892
HEY, JIMMY,

119
00:05:08,976 --> 00:05:10,686
CONGRATULATIONS, MAN. EH?

120
00:05:10,769 --> 00:05:13,856
LISTEN, I WANT TO HELP OUT
IF THERE IS ANYTHING I CAN DO.

121
00:05:13,939 --> 00:05:15,023
WHATEVER.

122
00:05:15,107 --> 00:05:16,942
PROBABLY NOT A GOOD IDEA,
SPIN.

123
00:05:17,025 --> 00:05:18,777
SPINNER:
COME ON, GUYS.
LET ME HELP OUT.

124
00:05:19,987 --> 00:05:22,281
LOOK, WHEN I SAID
YOU WERE DEAD TO ME,

125
00:05:22,364 --> 00:05:23,699
I MEANT FOREVER.

126
00:05:24,867 --> 00:05:26,201
YOU DON'T EXIST.

127
00:05:38,422 --> 00:05:40,507
SO, THIS WEEKEND?

128
00:05:40,591 --> 00:05:43,010
YOU, ME,
DOZENS OF HORNY HONEYS,

129
00:05:43,093 --> 00:05:46,471
AND AN ICE COLD KEG OF BEER.
SOUND GOOD?

130
00:05:46,555 --> 00:05:47,472
DUDE...

131
00:05:48,015 --> 00:05:50,225
DO YOU EVER THINK ABOUT
WHAT HAPPENED WITH...

132
00:05:50,309 --> 00:05:52,853
YOU KNOW, THE SHOOTING...
WITH RICK.

133
00:05:52,936 --> 00:05:54,563
SURE I DO.

134
00:05:54,646 --> 00:05:55,480
THE WAY I SEE IT,

135
00:05:55,564 --> 00:05:58,108
WE DID THE WORLD A FAVOUR.

136
00:05:58,192 --> 00:06:00,611
AND JIMMY?
WE HELPED HIM TOO, RIGHT?

137
00:06:00,694 --> 00:06:02,529
SPIN,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

138
00:06:02,613 --> 00:06:05,032
YOU'RE GETTING YOURSELF
ALL DEPRESSED!

139
00:06:05,115 --> 00:06:07,367
YOU GOT SCHOOL
FOR THAT.

140
00:06:07,451 --> 00:06:10,954
WHAT YOU NEED IS TO GET YOUR
MIND OFF THE DEPRESSING CRAP.

141
00:06:11,038 --> 00:06:12,706
HAVE SOME FUN.

142
00:06:16,793 --> 00:06:19,213
DUDE,
YOU ARE SO RIGHT.

143
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:28,388
SPINNER:
HEY UM...

144
00:06:28,472 --> 00:06:30,349
IS MY NAME STILL ON
THAT SIGN-UP SHEET?

145
00:06:30,432 --> 00:06:33,393
LOOK UNDER "I"
FOR "IDIOT".

146
00:06:33,477 --> 00:06:34,895
I DON'T KNOW, SPIN.

147
00:06:34,978 --> 00:06:38,065
THERE'S VOLLEYBALL,
BARBECUE.

148
00:06:38,148 --> 00:06:41,318
I DON'T THINK
YOU CAN HANDLE IT.

149
00:06:42,528 --> 00:06:44,238
YOU DON'T THINK
I CAN HANDLE IT?

150
00:06:44,321 --> 00:06:45,906
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

151
00:06:49,159 --> 00:06:57,835
♪♪♪

152
00:07:01,713 --> 00:07:03,423
WELL... ALL RIGHT.

153
00:07:03,507 --> 00:07:05,175
SO, IF I'M NOT
ON YOUR TEAM,

154
00:07:05,259 --> 00:07:07,845
THAT PUTS ME ON
THE WINNING TEAM, RIGHT?

155
00:07:07,928 --> 00:07:09,513
THAT'S FUNNY.

156
00:07:15,936 --> 00:07:16,562
LUCKY MAN.

157
00:07:18,355 --> 00:07:19,273
YOU'RE NOT HURTING.

158
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:22,526
KIM'S MY LIFE.

159
00:07:23,527 --> 00:07:25,279
DUDE,
YOU'RE MARRIED?!

160
00:07:25,362 --> 00:07:26,238
MARRIED?
NO. NO.

161
00:07:26,321 --> 00:07:26,905
THIS IS A...

162
00:07:26,989 --> 00:07:28,615
THIS IS A PRE-ENGAGEMENT
RING.

163
00:07:28,699 --> 00:07:29,867
WE GAVE THEM TO EACH OTHER
LAST YEAR

164
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:32,786
WHEN WE PLEDGED
OUR ABSTINENCE.

165
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:36,456
SO YOU WILLINGLY GAVE UP...
WITH HER?

166
00:07:37,207 --> 00:07:40,085
LINUS:
SPINNER, KIM AND I,
WE LOVE EACH OTHER,

167
00:07:40,169 --> 00:07:41,044
AND WE LOVE JESUS.

168
00:07:41,128 --> 00:07:43,630
THIS IS REALLY THE BEST WAY
TO SHOW IT, MAN.

169
00:07:43,714 --> 00:07:46,008
YEAH, BUT IF JESUS
DIDN'T WANT US TO HAVE SEX,

170
00:07:46,091 --> 00:07:48,427
HE'D MAKE EVERY GIRL LOOK
LIKE QUASIMODO'S SISTER.

171
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:48,886
I MEAN...

172
00:07:48,969 --> 00:07:50,012
(CHUCKLES)

173
00:07:51,263 --> 00:07:54,975
RELATIONSHIPS ARE NOT
ONLY ABOUT SEX.

174
00:07:55,058 --> 00:07:56,810
THEY'RE ABOUT SPIRITUAL
CONNECTEDNESS, MAN.

175
00:07:56,894 --> 00:07:58,312
COME ON.

176
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:09,489

178
00:08:11,992 --> 00:08:13,410
I GUESS SO.

179
00:08:14,203 --> 00:08:15,579
I HAVE A SUMMER JOB
ANYWAY.

180
00:08:15,662 --> 00:08:17,748
THERE'S THIS TINY
COMIC BOOK COMPANY.

181
00:08:17,831 --> 00:08:18,749
I'M DOING THEIR WEBSITE.

182
00:08:19,625 --> 00:08:21,168
YOU'RE KIDDING.
THAT'S AMAZING.

183
00:08:21,251 --> 00:08:22,753
ELLIE:
IT'S A JOB.

184
00:08:22,836 --> 00:08:24,505
I WAS GONNA HIRE YOU
TO DO THE ART WORK,

185
00:08:24,588 --> 00:08:26,006
BUT WHATEV.

186
00:08:27,049 --> 00:08:28,217
HAZEL?

187
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:30,385
I DID NOT KNOW
YOU WERE COMING.

188
00:08:30,469 --> 00:08:32,346
BUT SO GLAD
TO HAVE YOU HERE!

189
00:08:34,097 --> 00:08:35,641
MARCO:
OKAY, THE FOUNTAIN'S DOWN,

190
00:08:35,724 --> 00:08:37,100
AND I AM PARCHED.

191
00:08:37,184 --> 00:08:39,353
AND SOMEONE HAS GOT
TO WASH THESE BRUSHES.

192
00:08:39,436 --> 00:08:40,187
BOTH:
EW.

193
00:08:41,438 --> 00:08:42,397
LOOKS LIKE THIS PROJECT
COULD USE

194
00:08:42,481 --> 00:08:44,816
A LITTLE MORE
ORGANIZATION.

195
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:47,486
MARCO, I HAVE A CASE
OF WATER IN MY CAR.

196
00:08:47,569 --> 00:08:48,862
WHY DON'T YOU GO GET IT?

197
00:08:48,946 --> 00:08:51,240
PAIGE, I'LL WASH THESE BRUSHES.

198
00:08:51,323 --> 00:08:52,157
AND ELLIE...

199
00:08:53,283 --> 00:08:55,285
WHY DON'T YOU KEEP DOING
WHAT YOU'RE DOING?

200
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:02,292
(GUITAR PLAYING)

201
00:09:05,087 --> 00:09:05,796
LINUS:
ALL RIGHT, GUYS...

202
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:07,047
OKAY,
BEFORE I SING THIS SONG,

203
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:09,550
I WANNA TALK ABOUT SOMETHING.

204
00:09:10,592 --> 00:09:11,093
FEAR.

205
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:16,473
SPINNER,
WHAT SCARES YOU MOST?

206
00:09:17,724 --> 00:09:18,934
SPINNER:
MS. KWAN?

207
00:09:19,017 --> 00:09:19,852
(EVERYONE CHUCKLES)

208
00:09:21,395 --> 00:09:23,105
BE SERIOUS.
MELINDA?

209
00:09:24,147 --> 00:09:25,357
I'M SCARED OF DYING.

210
00:09:26,316 --> 00:09:27,317
BUT WHY, MELINDA?

211
00:09:27,401 --> 00:09:30,070
I MEAN, IF YOU'RE FORGIVEN
BY JESUS,

212
00:09:30,153 --> 00:09:31,280
YOU'LL GO TO HEAVEN.

213
00:09:31,363 --> 00:09:33,532
LINUS:
OKAY. BUT WHAT IF YOU DIE

214
00:09:33,615 --> 00:09:35,909
BEFORE YOU MAKE PEACE?

215
00:09:35,993 --> 00:09:38,078
SO BEFORE JESUS
COULD FORGIVE YOU?

216
00:09:38,161 --> 00:09:39,746
YOU'D GO TO HELL.

217
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:41,123
HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THAT,
SPINNER?

218
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:44,585
HOW DO YOU FEEL?

219
00:09:44,668 --> 00:09:48,338
DON'T YOU HAVE ANYTHING
YOU WANT TO BE FORGIVEN FOR?

220
00:09:50,174 --> 00:09:51,884
NO.
NOT PARTICULARLY.

221
00:09:55,512 --> 00:09:57,181
WHAT ABOUT YOUR FRIEND JIMMY?

222
00:10:00,434 --> 00:10:02,186
WHAT ABOUT HIM?

223
00:10:04,021 --> 00:10:07,357
NICE, DARCY.
NO BRAINWASHING, HUH?

224
00:10:12,196 --> 00:10:13,947
SPIN, I DIDN'T TELL HIM
ANYTHING.

225
00:10:14,031 --> 00:10:15,407
YEAH, THEN HOW'D
HE KNOW, DARCY?

226
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:17,034
HE'S PSYCHIC?

227
00:10:17,117 --> 00:10:19,411
I GUESS I MENTIONED IT
TO KIM.

228
00:10:19,494 --> 00:10:20,204
OH, THAT'S GREAT.

229
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:24,750
JUST SPILL MY MOST PRIVATE
SECRETS TO EVERYBODY.

230
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:25,792
WHO ARE YOU CALLING?

231
00:10:25,876 --> 00:10:26,627
JAY.

232
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:27,544
MY FRIEND.

233
00:10:28,378 --> 00:10:29,379
I'M OUTTA HERE.

234
00:10:29,463 --> 00:10:31,089
SPINNER, PLEASE.

235
00:10:31,173 --> 00:10:32,382
I'M SORRY THAT LINUS
AMBUSHED YOU.

236
00:10:32,466 --> 00:10:34,510
HE SHOULDN'T HAVE.
IT WAS A MISTAKE.

237
00:10:34,593 --> 00:10:36,470
NO, THIS WEEKEND
WAS A MISTAKE.

238
00:10:36,553 --> 00:10:39,598
THIS WHOLE RELATIONSHIP
IS A MISTAKE.

239
00:10:40,557 --> 00:10:42,226
JAY, WHAT'S UP, MAN?

240
00:10:50,901 --> 00:10:53,487
(LOUD MUSIC COMES FROM CAR)

241
00:10:54,404 --> 00:10:57,032
SPINNER:
IT'S ABOUT TIME, BUDDY.

242
00:10:57,115 --> 00:10:58,408
LET'S GO.

243
00:10:59,993 --> 00:11:01,620
SWEET MOTHER MARY.

244
00:11:01,703 --> 00:11:03,664
WHO KNEW CHRISTIAN GIRLS
COULD BE SO HOT?

245
00:11:04,331 --> 00:11:05,207
SPINNER:
YEAH, BUT TRUST ME,

246
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:07,125
THIS PLACE IS NO PARTY.

247
00:11:07,209 --> 00:11:08,377
NOT YET.

248
00:11:09,086 --> 00:11:09,962
NO, NO, NO,
NO, NO, NO

249
00:11:10,045 --> 00:11:11,213
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

250
00:11:11,296 --> 00:11:13,632
I JUST DROVE
TWO HOURS FOR YOU.

251
00:11:13,715 --> 00:11:15,676
AT LEAST LET ME JOIN
YOUR CHRISTIAN FRIENDS

252
00:11:15,759 --> 00:11:16,844
FOR A TASTY HOT DOG

253
00:11:16,927 --> 00:11:20,013
OR A COOL,
REFRESHING BEVERAGE?

254
00:11:21,807 --> 00:11:22,724
ONE HOTDOG.

255
00:11:22,808 --> 00:11:24,101
BEER STAYS IN THE CAR,

256
00:11:24,184 --> 00:11:25,310
YOUR MOUTH STAYS SHUT,

257
00:11:25,394 --> 00:11:26,603
AND SOMETHING ELSE
STAYS IN YOUR PANTS.

258
00:11:26,687 --> 00:11:27,604
CLEAR?

259
00:11:27,688 --> 00:11:29,064
I DON'T KNOW.

260
00:11:29,147 --> 00:11:31,149
LET ME PRAY ON IT.

261
00:11:38,031 --> 00:11:39,449
HAZEL:
HOW COME NOTHING RHYMES
WITH "ORANGE"?

262
00:11:39,533 --> 00:11:41,535
IT'S SUCH A LONELY WORD.

263
00:11:42,411 --> 00:11:45,414
AND WHAT'S NOT
A LONELY WORD?

264
00:11:45,497 --> 00:11:47,958
HAZEL, CAUSE IT GOES
SO PERFECTLY WITH JIMMY.

265
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:51,336
THAT DOESN'T EVEN RHYME.

266
00:11:54,798 --> 00:11:57,509
SO, ELLIE,
THIS COMIC BOOK WEBSITE,

267
00:11:57,593 --> 00:11:58,886
ARE YOU GOING
TO USE FLASH?

268
00:11:58,969 --> 00:12:00,637
UH, IT'S ALL CUSTOMIZED,

269
00:12:00,721 --> 00:12:02,598
BUT I'M ALSO PUTTING
TOGETHER TEMPLATES.

270
00:12:02,973 --> 00:12:05,475
I REALLY LIKE
THE CRIMSON KID.

271
00:12:06,810 --> 00:12:08,770
FLASH...
THE CRIMSON KID.

272
00:12:09,646 --> 00:12:12,608
YOU GUYS WERE TALKING
ABOUT COMIC BOOKS, RIGHT?

273
00:12:12,691 --> 00:12:15,235
I'VE BEEN READING UP.

274
00:12:15,319 --> 00:12:18,530
UM... WE'RE TALKING
ABOUT FLASH ANIMATION.

275
00:12:18,614 --> 00:12:21,200
IT'S A COMPUTER THING.
IT'S COMPLICATED.

276
00:12:21,283 --> 00:12:23,869
RIGHT.
AND I WOULDN'T GET THAT.

277
00:12:31,251 --> 00:12:32,336
MY DAD JUST COULDN'T
TAKE IT ANYMORE

278
00:12:32,419 --> 00:12:34,421
SO HE TOOK OFF
ON HIS HOG.

279
00:12:34,505 --> 00:12:36,256
AND YOUR MOM?
WAS SHE OKAY?

280
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:37,758
WELL, I HELPED HER THROUGH
HER PAINKILLER ADDICTION,

281
00:12:37,841 --> 00:12:39,301
BUT ONCE SHE WAS
IN DRUG REHAB,

282
00:12:39,384 --> 00:12:42,095
IT WAS LIKE...
LIKE I WAS ADDICTED...

283
00:12:42,179 --> 00:12:43,764
ADDICTED TO HELPING PEOPLE.

284
00:12:43,847 --> 00:12:44,431
REALLY?

285
00:12:44,515 --> 00:12:45,349
YEAH.

286
00:12:45,432 --> 00:12:46,475
SO THAT'S WHEN
YOU LEFT SCHOOL?

287
00:12:46,558 --> 00:12:48,143
AND HEADED DOWN
TO SOUTH AMERICA, YES,

288
00:12:48,227 --> 00:12:49,686
TO THE MOUNTAINS OF ECUADOR.

289
00:12:49,770 --> 00:12:50,979
I BUILT A CHURCH,

290
00:12:51,063 --> 00:12:53,232
AND A ONE-ROOM SCHOOL
AND A WELL.

291
00:12:53,315 --> 00:12:55,275
IT JUST FELT SO GOOD.

292
00:12:55,359 --> 00:12:57,486
MAN, JAY IS QUITE
THE STORYTELLER.

293
00:12:57,569 --> 00:13:00,030
YEAH, AND MELINDA'S NOT
THE SHARPEST TOOL IN THE SHED.

294
00:13:00,656 --> 00:13:01,990
HEY, LISTEN,

295
00:13:02,074 --> 00:13:04,910
I'M SORRY FOR
WHAT I SAID BEFORE.

296
00:13:04,993 --> 00:13:06,912
I DIDN'T MEAN IT.

297
00:13:10,374 --> 00:13:13,335
I CAN PARTY TOO,
YOU KNOW?

298
00:13:13,418 --> 00:13:15,629
SO, DON'T THINK
I'M A COMPLETE LOSER.

299
00:13:15,712 --> 00:13:17,631
I DON'T THINK
YOU'RE A LOSER.

300
00:13:17,714 --> 00:13:20,008
I THINK
YOU'RE GREAT.

301
00:13:22,052 --> 00:13:24,054
I REALLY FEEL LIKE
I CAN TALK TO YOU,

302
00:13:24,137 --> 00:13:25,597
YOU KNOW?

303
00:13:25,681 --> 00:13:27,349
JUST...NOT HERE.

304
00:13:30,519 --> 00:13:32,354
MELINDA:
LET'S GO SOMEPLACE PRIVATE.

305
00:13:34,523 --> 00:13:35,899
JAY?

306
00:13:35,983 --> 00:13:39,236
CAN I TALK TO YOU
JUST FOR A SECOND?

307
00:13:41,488 --> 00:13:43,448
JAY:
SPINNER, SLOW DOWN.

308
00:13:43,532 --> 00:13:45,659
I WAS JUST ABOUT
TO REDEFINE BIBLE THUMPING.

309
00:13:45,742 --> 00:13:46,451
NO, MAN.

310
00:13:46,535 --> 00:13:48,203
YOU WERE JUST ABOUT
TO TAKE A HIKE.

311
00:13:48,287 --> 00:13:49,329
PRAISE THE LORD!

312
00:13:49,413 --> 00:13:51,832
GOD, THOSE FREAKS
REALLY GOT TO YOU.

313
00:13:51,915 --> 00:13:53,709
HAVE YOU ALWAYS
BEEN THIS STUPID

314
00:13:53,792 --> 00:13:55,002
OR AM I JUST
NOTICING IT NOW?

315
00:13:55,085 --> 00:13:57,129
MAN, EVER SINCE
YOU MET MS. WWJD?

316
00:13:57,212 --> 00:13:59,715
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHO YOU ARE ANYMORE.

317
00:13:59,798 --> 00:14:02,843
I MEAN, WHAT KIND OF HOLD
DOES SHE HAVE ON YOU ANYWAYS?

318
00:14:02,926 --> 00:14:04,553
IS SHE THAT GOOD
IN BED?

319
00:14:04,636 --> 00:14:05,971
IT'S NOT LIKE THAT,
MAN.

320
00:14:06,054 --> 00:14:08,015
WE DON'T...
WE DON'T EVEN HAVE SEX.

321
00:14:10,601 --> 00:14:11,268
NO SEX?

322
00:14:12,352 --> 00:14:13,604
NOTHING?
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

323
00:14:13,687 --> 00:14:15,814
WHAT'S HER PROBLEM?

324
00:14:15,898 --> 00:14:17,691
SHE BELIEVES IN SOMETHING,
ALL RIGHT?

325
00:14:17,774 --> 00:14:19,318
IS THAT IMPOSSIBLE

326
00:14:19,401 --> 00:14:21,528
FOR YOU TO GET INTO YOUR
TWISTED LITTLE BRAIN?

327
00:14:21,612 --> 00:14:23,030
NO.
LOOK, WHATEVER.

328
00:14:23,113 --> 00:14:26,325
I JUST WANT YOU
TO BE HAPPY.

329
00:14:26,408 --> 00:14:27,326
DARCY:
HOPE YOU DON'T MIND.

330
00:14:27,409 --> 00:14:30,704
I SCOOPED THESE
FROM YOUR CAR.

331
00:14:30,787 --> 00:14:31,705
JAY:
MIND?

332
00:14:32,206 --> 00:14:35,209
NO, I WASN'T GOING
ANYWHERE.

333
00:14:35,292 --> 00:14:36,084
DARCY:
SOMETIMES...

334
00:14:36,168 --> 00:14:37,377
YOU GOTTA BEND
THE RULES.

335
00:14:37,461 --> 00:14:39,129
JUST A LITTLE.

336
00:14:48,013 --> 00:14:49,139
OH, NICE CATCH.

337
00:14:49,223 --> 00:14:51,099
NICE CATCH.

338
00:14:51,183 --> 00:14:53,018
DARCY,
YOU GOING TO PARTAKE?

339
00:14:53,101 --> 00:14:54,937
UGH! TASTES LIKE BARF.

340
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:56,230
YOU'VE TRIED BEER?

341
00:14:56,313 --> 00:14:56,897
YEAH.

342
00:14:56,980 --> 00:14:59,149
A BIT TOO MUCH OF IT
ONE NIGHT.

343
00:14:59,233 --> 00:15:00,192
AGES AGO.

344
00:15:00,275 --> 00:15:02,778
HENCE,
TASTES LIKE BARF.

345
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:06,114
WELL, CHEERS TO THAT.

346
00:15:09,868 --> 00:15:11,578
LOOKS LIKE WE'RE GONNA NEED
ANOTHER ROUND.

347
00:15:11,662 --> 00:15:12,496
I'LL GET IT.

348
00:15:12,579 --> 00:15:14,998
NO, NO, NO.
I'LL GO.

349
00:15:16,708 --> 00:15:21,588
JAY:
SO, UNDERNEATH THAT NUN'S HABIT
LIES A LIVING, BREATHING GIRL.

350
00:15:21,672 --> 00:15:22,172
WHO KNEW?

351
00:15:22,256 --> 00:15:23,590
SPINNER.

352
00:15:23,674 --> 00:15:25,551
YEAH, RIGHT,
SPINNER.

353
00:15:25,634 --> 00:15:26,510
HE'S ALL ABOUT YOU
THESE DAYS.

354
00:15:26,593 --> 00:15:27,511
I'VE NEVER SEEN HIM
LIKE THIS.

355
00:15:27,594 --> 00:15:29,555
NOT ABOUT ANYBODY.

356
00:15:29,638 --> 00:15:31,557
NOT MANNY?
PAIGE?

357
00:15:32,057 --> 00:15:33,976
OH NO.
HE TOLD ME.

358
00:15:34,059 --> 00:15:37,938
YOU'RE WAY BETTER
THAN PAIGE OR MANNY.

359
00:15:38,021 --> 00:15:39,439
THING IS...

360
00:15:40,190 --> 00:15:41,149
WHAT?

361
00:15:42,651 --> 00:15:45,529
IT'S MANNY.
SHE'S MOVING IN ON HIM.

362
00:15:45,612 --> 00:15:46,530
WHAT?

363
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:48,615
I THOUGHT
SHE WAS WITH CRAIG.

364
00:15:48,699 --> 00:15:51,243
JAY:
SHE WANTS SOMETHING
ON THE SIDE WITH SPINNER.

365
00:15:51,326 --> 00:15:52,619
I'M TALKING SEX.

366
00:15:52,703 --> 00:15:54,538
HE KEEPS TRYING
TO FIGHT HER OFF BUT...

367
00:15:54,621 --> 00:15:55,622
HOW LONG CAN
HE KEEP FIGHTING?

368
00:15:55,706 --> 00:15:57,291
I MEAN, HE'S A GUY
AND...

369
00:15:58,041 --> 00:15:59,960
WELL, IF HE DOESN'T
GET SOMETHING SOON,

370
00:16:00,043 --> 00:16:01,336
THEN...

371
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,255
GAME OVER.

372
00:16:04,882 --> 00:16:08,302
LOOK, IT'S JUST LIKE
YOU SAID, DARCY.

373
00:16:08,385 --> 00:16:09,887
SOMETIMES YOU GOTTA
BEND THE RULES.

374
00:16:12,890 --> 00:16:13,473
(SIGHS)

375
00:16:44,046 --> 00:16:46,381
YOU'VE GOT TO BE KIDDING ME.

376
00:17:11,573 --> 00:17:13,951
DUDE,
I GOT ROUND TWO.

377
00:17:14,034 --> 00:17:15,953
YOUR LADY AWAITS.

378
00:17:28,507 --> 00:17:29,508
HEY... W-WHAT?

379
00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:33,428
WHAT'S GOING ON?

380
00:17:42,855 --> 00:17:46,525
ON SECOND THOUGHT,
NO NEED TO EXPLAIN.

381
00:17:53,115 --> 00:17:54,116
DARCY,

382
00:17:55,158 --> 00:17:56,535
I LOVE YOU.

383
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:02,958
(CRYING)

384
00:18:08,922 --> 00:18:09,381
ARE YOU OKAY?

385
00:18:09,464 --> 00:18:11,717
I'M FINE.
KEEP GOING.

386
00:18:19,391 --> 00:18:20,809
HEY, WHAT'S WRONG?
WHAT'S WRONG?

387
00:18:20,893 --> 00:18:22,227
IT'S OKAY.

388
00:18:22,769 --> 00:18:25,564
JAY TOLD ME
ABOUT MANNY,

389
00:18:25,647 --> 00:18:27,107
ABOUT EVERYTHING.

390
00:18:27,191 --> 00:18:28,025
WAIT! WHAT?

391
00:18:28,108 --> 00:18:29,276
WHAT MANNY?

392
00:18:29,359 --> 00:18:33,739
I HAVEN'T SPOKEN TO MANNY
IN LIKE, A YEAR.

393
00:18:39,494 --> 00:18:42,331
OKAY,
START AT THE BEGINNING.

394
00:18:42,414 --> 00:18:45,501
WHAT DID JAY TELL YOU,
EXACTLY?

395
00:18:50,047 --> 00:18:52,049
WHO IS YOUR SAVIOUR NOW?!

396
00:19:03,018 --> 00:19:03,602
JAY:
SPINNER!

397
00:19:03,685 --> 00:19:06,438
SPINNER:
WHY DID YOU DO IT, HUH?!

398
00:19:10,984 --> 00:19:11,944
YOU SAID YOU WANTED
SOME ACTION.

399
00:19:12,027 --> 00:19:13,278
I WAS JUST TRYING
TO HELP YOU GET IT!

400
00:19:13,362 --> 00:19:15,322
NO. YOU JUST WANTED
TO RUIN IT,

401
00:19:15,405 --> 00:19:17,032
LIKE YOU'VE RUINED
EVERYTHING IN MY LIFE -

402
00:19:17,115 --> 00:19:18,784
JIMMY AND NOW DARCY.

403
00:19:18,867 --> 00:19:19,618
JAY:
OH YEAH, OH YEAH.

404
00:19:19,701 --> 00:19:20,369
I'M THE DEVIL.

405
00:19:20,452 --> 00:19:21,745
I'M THE EVIL,
LOW-DOWN SINNER.

406
00:19:21,828 --> 00:19:23,747
SOMEBODY SAVE ME!

407
00:19:24,289 --> 00:19:25,958
YOU KNOW WHAT?

408
00:19:26,041 --> 00:19:27,209
GET OUT OF HERE.

409
00:19:27,292 --> 00:19:29,753
I NEVER WANT TO SEE
YOU AGAIN EVER.

410
00:19:29,837 --> 00:19:30,587
GO.

411
00:19:32,047 --> 00:19:32,756
GO!

412
00:19:42,933 --> 00:19:44,852
HAZEL:
SO THIS WHOLE THING -
THIS MURAL -

413
00:19:44,935 --> 00:19:45,769
THIS WAS ALL ABOUT HER?

414
00:19:45,853 --> 00:19:47,187
JIMMY:
OF COURSE NOT.

415
00:19:47,271 --> 00:19:50,148
AND I DIDN'T EVEN MEAN
FOR THAT GIRL TO BE ELLIE.

416
00:19:50,232 --> 00:19:51,191
I GUESS IT LOOKS
A LITTLE BIT LIKE HER -

417
00:19:51,275 --> 00:19:52,401
HAZEL:
A LITTLE BIT?

418
00:19:52,484 --> 00:19:54,403
JIMMY,
THAT'S HER FACE

419
00:19:54,486 --> 00:19:55,404
TO A TEE.

420
00:19:55,487 --> 00:19:56,363
I CAN PAINT IT OVER.

421
00:19:56,446 --> 00:19:57,823
THAT'S NOT THE POINT.

422
00:19:57,906 --> 00:20:01,535
WHY DID YOU PAINT IT
IN THE FIRST PLACE?

423
00:20:02,244 --> 00:20:03,912
OBVIOUSLY YOU LIKE HER.

424
00:20:03,996 --> 00:20:05,330
BE HONEST.

425
00:20:05,998 --> 00:20:07,749
OKAY.
HAZEL, LOOK...

426
00:20:07,833 --> 00:20:08,750
I LOVE YOU.

427
00:20:09,376 --> 00:20:11,712
BUT ELLIE, SHE...

428
00:20:11,795 --> 00:20:13,130
SHE INSPIRES ME.

429
00:20:13,213 --> 00:20:14,798
I SO DID NOT
NEED TO HEAR THAT.

430
00:20:14,882 --> 00:20:15,883
JIMMY:
WELL, HEY, YOU WANTED HONESTY.

431
00:20:15,966 --> 00:20:16,758
I'M BEING HONEST.

432
00:20:16,842 --> 00:20:18,719
NO,
YOU'RE BEING A COWARD.

433
00:20:18,802 --> 00:20:20,804
AND IF YOU WON'T SAY IT,
THEN I WILL.

434
00:20:20,888 --> 00:20:22,014
SO HERE IT IS, JIMMY.

435
00:20:22,097 --> 00:20:22,723
READY?

436
00:20:23,265 --> 00:20:24,433
WE'RE THROUGH.

437
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:33,358
I'M SORRY...

438
00:20:34,067 --> 00:20:35,819
FOR BRINGING
JAY HERE,

439
00:20:35,903 --> 00:20:37,863
FOR WHAT HE SAID.

440
00:20:38,614 --> 00:20:40,449
FOR EVERYTHING.

441
00:20:40,532 --> 00:20:42,242
IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT.

442
00:20:42,868 --> 00:20:45,537
YOU WERE TRYING
TO BE HIS FRIEND -

443
00:20:45,621 --> 00:20:46,705
HIS ONLY FRIEND

444
00:20:46,788 --> 00:20:49,458
BECAUSE, P.S.,
HE'S A JERK.

445
00:20:51,668 --> 00:20:53,587
I LOVE YOU, SPIN.

446
00:20:56,507 --> 00:20:57,674
YOU SHOULDN'T.

447
00:20:57,758 --> 00:21:00,010
I HURT EVERYONE.

448
00:21:00,093 --> 00:21:01,470
YOU, JIMMY...

449
00:21:01,553 --> 00:21:03,639
I'M...
I'M NOT WORTH IT.

450
00:21:04,097 --> 00:21:06,141
YOU ARE.
I KNOW IT.

451
00:21:06,934 --> 00:21:08,977
JESUS KNOWS IT.

452
00:21:09,603 --> 00:21:12,314
HOW CAN JESUS
FORGIVE SOMEONE

453
00:21:12,397 --> 00:21:15,400
WHO GOT HIS
BEST FRIEND SHOT?

454
00:21:15,484 --> 00:21:17,903
BECAUSE HE JUST DOES.

455
00:21:17,986 --> 00:21:21,198
ALL YOU NEED TO DO
IS BELIEVE.

456
00:21:21,281 --> 00:21:22,950
IT'S TOO LATE.

457
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:25,285
NO, IT'S NOT.

458
00:21:26,870 --> 00:21:28,664
WE'LL FIND JESUS
TOGETHER.

459
00:21:28,747 --> 00:21:29,665
OKAY?

460
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:33,961
OKAY.
