1
00:00:03,462 --> 00:00:06,131
MARCO, ARE WE STILL
FISHING THIS WEEKEND?

2
00:00:06,215 --> 00:00:08,550
YEAH.
YEAH, OF COURSE.

3
00:00:10,511 --> 00:00:12,679
LOUISE, I THINK OUR BOY
IS GOING CRAZY!

4
00:00:12,763 --> 00:00:14,431
LOOK, HE'S TALKING TO HIMSELF.

5
00:00:14,515 --> 00:00:15,974
(CHUCKLES)

6
00:00:16,058 --> 00:00:17,309
YOU'RE FUNNY, PA.

7
00:00:17,392 --> 00:00:18,852
IT'S FOR THE SCHOOL PLAY.

8
00:00:18,936 --> 00:00:21,855
WE'RE HOSTING THE CITY
DRAMA FESTIVAL.

9
00:00:21,939 --> 00:00:23,190
MARCO...

10
00:00:23,273 --> 00:00:24,900
DON'T TELL ME
YOU'RE BECOMING AN ACTOR.

11
00:00:24,983 --> 00:00:26,860
NO. NO, THIS IS JUST
A FAVOUR FOR MR. SIMPSON.

12
00:00:26,944 --> 00:00:28,195
I'M NOT BECOMING AN ACTOR.

13
00:00:28,278 --> 00:00:29,488
MR. DEL ROSSI:
RIGHT.

14
00:00:29,571 --> 00:00:31,448
BECAUSE YOU'RE LEARNING
THE PRINTING BUSINESS WITH ME.

15
00:00:33,367 --> 00:00:35,202
PA, WE'VE DISCUSSED THIS.

16
00:00:35,285 --> 00:00:37,371
SOCIAL WORK.
I WANNA HELP PEOPLE.

17
00:00:37,454 --> 00:00:38,872
(MOCKS)
...HELP PEOPLE.

18
00:00:38,956 --> 00:00:41,208
NO, LOOK, SOCIAL WORK
IS A GOOD JOB.

19
00:00:41,291 --> 00:00:43,293
COUSIN LOU
BECAME A SOCIAL WORKER.

20
00:00:43,377 --> 00:00:44,378
COUSIN LOU?

21
00:00:44,461 --> 00:00:46,088
PLEASE, COUSIN LOU
IS A FINOCIO!

22
00:00:46,171 --> 00:00:46,922
PA...

23
00:00:47,464 --> 00:00:49,174
COUSIN LOU IS A GREAT GUY.

24
00:00:49,258 --> 00:00:50,717
HE HELPS PEOPLE.

25
00:00:50,801 --> 00:00:52,636
YEAH, BUT HE DOESN'T HELP
HIS POOR MOTHER.

26
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:54,555
HIS MOTHER WOULD LOVE
A GRANDCHILD ONE DAY.

27
00:00:54,638 --> 00:00:56,390
BUT FROM COUSIN LOU?

28
00:00:56,473 --> 00:00:57,391
GOOD LUCK.

29
00:00:57,474 --> 00:00:58,433
SO HE'LL ADOPT.

30
00:00:58,517 --> 00:00:59,560
IT'S NO BIG DEAL.

31
00:00:59,643 --> 00:01:01,103
MR. DEL ROSSI:
NO BIG DEAL?

32
00:01:01,186 --> 00:01:04,231
MARCO, FOR A PARENT
TO RAISE A HOMOSEXUAL?

33
00:01:04,314 --> 00:01:05,566
IT'S LIKE A FAILURE.

34
00:01:05,649 --> 00:01:06,775
AN EMBARRASSMENT.

35
00:01:06,859 --> 00:01:07,401
OH REALLY?

36
00:01:07,484 --> 00:01:08,861
WELL, LET ME TELL YOU THAT...

37
00:01:15,951 --> 00:01:17,077
THAT I HAVE A REHEARSAL

38
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:19,746
AND I DON'T KNOW
MY LINES.

39
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:20,664
BYE.

40
00:01:20,747 --> 00:01:21,498

AND GAVE SUCH A...

54
00:02:12,424 --> 00:02:13,342
MASTERLY REPORT.

55
00:02:13,425 --> 00:02:15,761
TOBY:
MASTERLY REPORT...

56
00:02:22,184 --> 00:02:23,268
STRESSED MUCH?

57
00:02:23,352 --> 00:02:24,353
MARCO:
THERE'S NO WAY

58
00:02:24,436 --> 00:02:25,979
I'M EVER GONNA MEMORIZE
THESE LINES.

59
00:02:26,063 --> 00:02:26,647
RELAX,

60
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:27,981
IT'S NOT LIKE
YOU'RE THE STAR

61
00:02:28,065 --> 00:02:30,108
OR THE SCHOOL'S HOPES
TO WIN THIS DRAMA FESTIVAL

62
00:02:30,192 --> 00:02:31,818
ARE RIDING ON YOU.

63
00:02:31,902 --> 00:02:33,403
WAIT, YOU'RE HAMLET,
RIGHT?

64
00:02:33,487 --> 00:02:34,905
IT IS RIDING ON YOU!

65
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:35,656
YEAH.

66
00:02:35,739 --> 00:02:37,366
SOMEONE REMIND ME
TO KILL HIM...

67
00:02:37,449 --> 00:02:38,867
AFTER I'M DONE
MEMORIZING THIS.

68
00:02:38,951 --> 00:02:40,160
HMM,
I'LL REMIND YOU,

69
00:02:40,244 --> 00:02:43,372
ONCE YOU REMIND ME
WHY WE VOLUNTEERED TO DO THIS.

70
00:02:43,455 --> 00:02:46,291
BECAUSE WE THOUGHT
IT'D BE FUN.

71
00:02:46,375 --> 00:02:48,293
AND BECAUSE SIMPSON GAVE US

72
00:02:48,377 --> 00:02:50,838
THAT WHOLE "HELP ME,
HELP DEGRASSI" SPEECH.

73
00:02:50,921 --> 00:02:52,506
BECAUSE SOMEONE KNEW
THAT CUTE, NEW GUY

74
00:02:52,589 --> 00:02:54,049
HAD ALREADY VOLUNTEERED?

75
00:02:54,132 --> 00:02:55,259
WHO?

76
00:02:55,342 --> 00:02:56,260
TIM?

77
00:02:57,594 --> 00:02:58,387
OKAY.

78
00:02:58,470 --> 00:02:59,346
OKAY, HE'S OKAY.

79
00:02:59,429 --> 00:03:00,389
I MEAN, IF YOU LIKE
THAT WHOLE DARK,

80
00:03:00,472 --> 00:03:01,849
MYSTERIOUS THING.

81
00:03:01,932 --> 00:03:03,767
MM, YEAH.
QUEL TURN-OFF.

82
00:03:15,654 --> 00:03:16,822
PERFECT.

83
00:03:17,447 --> 00:03:18,615
WHAT ARE YOU,
THE LEANING TOWER OF PETER?

84
00:03:18,699 --> 00:03:20,409
IT'S COMPLETELY CROOKED.

85
00:03:20,492 --> 00:03:22,911
I WASN'T TALKING
ABOUT THE POSTER.

86
00:03:22,995 --> 00:03:24,204
OKAY.

87
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:25,706
LET ME SET
ONE THING STRAIGHT:

88
00:03:25,789 --> 00:03:28,500
YOU ARE NEVER GETTING
ANYWHERE WITH ME.

89
00:03:28,584 --> 00:03:29,751
NEVER SAY NEVER.

90
00:03:29,835 --> 00:03:31,670
AW, BUT IT'S FUN.

91
00:03:31,753 --> 00:03:34,381
NEVER, NEVER, NEVER, NEVER,
NEVER, NEVER, NEVER.

92
00:03:34,464 --> 00:03:36,717
YEAH, EASY TO SAY,
BUT IT'S HARDER TO MEAN.

93
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:37,759
AND I KNOW YOU DON'T.

94
00:03:37,843 --> 00:03:38,927
PLEASE.

95
00:03:39,511 --> 00:03:40,470
LOOK,
IF YOU HATE ME SO MUCH

96
00:03:40,554 --> 00:03:42,014
WHY DID YOU GO ON A DATE
WITH ME THE OTHER NIGHT?

97
00:03:42,097 --> 00:03:44,224
IT WASN'T A DATE.

98
00:03:44,308 --> 00:03:45,559
IT WAS AN APPRAISAL.

99
00:03:45,642 --> 00:03:48,395
OH YEAH?
AND HOW DID I DO?

100
00:03:48,478 --> 00:03:51,148
MY FILES ARE CONFIDENTIAL.

101
00:03:56,195 --> 00:03:58,614
NOW THAT'S PERFECT.

102
00:03:58,697 --> 00:04:00,449
SEE YOU AROUND.

103
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:07,039
PAIGE:
O, WHAT A NOBLE MIND
IS HERE OVERTHROWN!

104
00:04:07,122 --> 00:04:08,707
THE-THE COURIER'S...

105
00:04:09,374 --> 00:04:11,084
CRAIG:
COURTIER'S.

106
00:04:11,168 --> 00:04:15,130
PAIGE:
COURTIER'S, SOLDIER'S,
SCHOLAR'S, EYE...

107
00:04:15,797 --> 00:04:16,381
FAGGOT.

108
00:04:18,342 --> 00:04:19,843
CRAIG, DON'T.

109
00:04:19,927 --> 00:04:20,928
DON'T.

110
00:04:22,054 --> 00:04:22,930
TIM, HEY.

111
00:04:23,013 --> 00:04:24,306
WHOA.
YOU OKAY?

112
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:26,266
YEAH. I'M FINE.

113
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:27,768
HERE DUDE,
LET ME TAKE YOU TO THE NURSE.

114
00:04:27,851 --> 00:04:29,520
NO.
MARCO, I'M FINE.

115
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:32,564
WELL, LET ME
DO SOMETHING?

116
00:04:32,648 --> 00:04:33,899
ANYTHING?

117
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:38,570
HEY, SORRY ABOUT
WHAT HAPPENED TODAY.

118
00:04:38,654 --> 00:04:39,780
DEGRASSI'S PRETTY COOL,

119
00:04:39,863 --> 00:04:43,283
BUT THERE ARE IDIOTS
EVERYWHERE.

120
00:04:43,367 --> 00:04:44,201
SO...

121
00:04:45,077 --> 00:04:46,370
WHO HAVE YOU TOLD?

122
00:04:46,453 --> 00:04:47,287
NO ONE.

123
00:04:47,371 --> 00:04:48,330
EXCEPT MY BEST FRIEND.

124
00:04:48,413 --> 00:04:51,124
WELL, MY FORMER BEST FRIEND.

125
00:04:51,208 --> 00:04:53,210
OH. DIDN'T GO WELL THEN,
I TAKE IT.

126
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:54,461
MY BEST FRIEND
SINCE GRADE THREE

127
00:04:54,545 --> 00:04:55,128
CALLED ME A FAG

128
00:04:55,212 --> 00:04:57,422
AND PUNCHED ME
IN THE FACE.

129
00:04:57,506 --> 00:04:59,633
WELL, YOU'LL FIND
A NEW FRIEND.

130
00:04:59,716 --> 00:05:00,717
RIGHT.

131
00:05:00,801 --> 00:05:02,010
IT'S JUST...

132
00:05:02,094 --> 00:05:05,472
I DON'T KNOW ANYBODY WHO WOULD
EVEN BEGIN TO GET THIS.

133
00:05:05,556 --> 00:05:07,099
YOU DO NOW.

134
00:05:07,182 --> 00:05:08,642
TIM, LOOK...

135
00:05:08,725 --> 00:05:10,853
I'VE BEEN WHERE YOU ARE,
OKAY?

136
00:05:10,936 --> 00:05:13,564
TWO YEARS AGO,
I WAS YOU.

137
00:05:14,565 --> 00:05:15,858
SO I CAN HELP YOU.

138
00:05:15,941 --> 00:05:18,193
AND I WANT TO HELP YOU.

139
00:05:18,277 --> 00:05:19,778
AS A FRIEND.

140
00:05:20,487 --> 00:05:22,489
THANK YOU, MARCO.

141
00:05:23,907 --> 00:05:25,325
YOU'RE LIKE MY YODA.

142
00:05:25,409 --> 00:05:26,493
OH, YEAH.

143
00:05:26,577 --> 00:05:29,162
WELL, MEMORIZE LINES,
WE MUST.

144
00:05:29,246 --> 00:05:31,498
ANGRY SIMPSON WILL BE,
HMM?

145
00:05:31,582 --> 00:05:32,416
(CHUCKLES)

146
00:05:36,461 --> 00:05:38,297
EMMA:
TICKETS FOR THE DRAMA FESTIVAL?

147
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:39,506
TICKETS?

148
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:41,425
TICKETS FOR THE DRAMA FESTIVAL?

149
00:05:41,508 --> 00:05:42,843
TICKET?

150
00:05:42,926 --> 00:05:44,219
ALLOW ME.

151
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:47,472
HI, I'M PETER.

152
00:05:47,556 --> 00:05:48,348
HI.

153
00:05:48,432 --> 00:05:50,350
DEGRASSI'S HOSTING
THE CITY DRAMA FESTIVAL.

154
00:05:50,434 --> 00:05:51,602
IT'S A PRESTIGIOUS EVENT.

155
00:05:51,685 --> 00:05:53,020
IT'S GONNA DO A LOT
FOR THE SCHOOL.

156
00:05:53,103 --> 00:05:54,479
SO WE'RE ASKING EVERYONE
TO COME OUT

157
00:05:54,563 --> 00:05:56,940
AND SHOW THEIR SUPPORT.

158
00:05:58,108 --> 00:05:59,443
THANK YOU.

159
00:06:03,238 --> 00:06:04,615
SELLING'S IN MY BLOOD.

160
00:06:04,698 --> 00:06:05,782
MY DAD'S A CAR SALESMAN.

161
00:06:05,866 --> 00:06:06,950
IMPORTS, MAINLY.

162
00:06:07,034 --> 00:06:08,368
MAYBE HE COULD GIVE ME
SOME POINTERS.

163
00:06:08,452 --> 00:06:09,745
I COULD SURE USE THEM.

164
00:06:09,828 --> 00:06:11,038
I'LL GIVE YOU
SOME POINTERS.

165
00:06:11,121 --> 00:06:14,374
SAY TODAY, 4 P.M.,
AT THE DOT?

166
00:06:14,458 --> 00:06:15,834
I WALKED RIGHT
INTO THAT ONE.

167
00:06:15,918 --> 00:06:17,586
COME ON, JUST GO OUT
WITH ME AGAIN.

168
00:06:17,669 --> 00:06:18,295
OKAY PETER,

169
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:20,005
MY BEST FRIEND
HATES YOU.

170
00:06:20,088 --> 00:06:22,007
I CAN'T BE SEEN
TALKING TO YOU.

171
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:24,343
YOU NEED TO BACK OFF.

172
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:30,557
WAS HE BOTHERING YOU?

173
00:06:30,641 --> 00:06:31,767
IT'S OKAY.

174
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:33,143
IT'S NOT.

175
00:06:33,227 --> 00:06:35,479
HE WAS HARASSING YOU.

176
00:06:35,562 --> 00:06:38,899
WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING
ABOUT HIM.

177
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,401
MARCO,
I'M SUCH AN IDIOT.

178
00:06:41,485 --> 00:06:44,488
I LEFT THE COMPUTER ON
AND I FORGOT TO LOG OUT.

179
00:06:44,571 --> 00:06:46,823
OH,
CLASSIC BEGINNER'S MISTAKE.

180
00:06:46,907 --> 00:06:48,325
MY DAD SAT DOWN
AND THERE IT WAS -

181
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:49,993
A GAY TEENS CHATROOM.

182
00:06:50,077 --> 00:06:50,827
SO HE CONFRONTED ME,

183
00:06:50,911 --> 00:06:51,954
AND THE NEXT THING I KNOW,

184
00:06:52,037 --> 00:06:53,622
I'M OUT THE DOOR,
RUNNING.

185
00:06:53,705 --> 00:06:55,541
OH MY GOD.
WHERE DID YOU GO?

186
00:06:55,624 --> 00:06:57,626
NOWHERE;
EVERYWHERE.

187
00:06:57,709 --> 00:06:59,878
I JUST HAD
TO KEEP MOVING.

188
00:06:59,962 --> 00:07:01,547
IT'S SCARY OUT THERE.

189
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:03,465
TIM, YOU CAN'T
DO THAT AGAIN.

190
00:07:03,549 --> 00:07:04,216
IT'S DANGEROUS.

191
00:07:04,299 --> 00:07:05,384
YOU HAVE TO GO HOME.

192
00:07:05,467 --> 00:07:06,426
WHAT IF HE KICKS ME OUT?

193
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:07,386
WE'LL FIGURE IT OUT
THEN.

194
00:07:07,469 --> 00:07:08,804
BUT FIRST,
YOU GOTTA GO HOME

195
00:07:08,887 --> 00:07:10,639
AND FACE YOUR DAD.

196
00:07:10,722 --> 00:07:13,350
RIGHT.
AND TELL HIM WHAT?

197
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:18,730
JUST TELL HIM
THE TRUTH.

198
00:07:18,814 --> 00:07:20,482
I MEAN, YOU HAVE TO SHOW HIM
THE REAL YOU, RIGHT?

199
00:07:20,566 --> 00:07:21,775
AND SHOW HIM THE TIM

200
00:07:21,859 --> 00:07:24,945
THAT YOU'VE BEEN HIDING
ALL THESE YEARS.

201
00:07:25,028 --> 00:07:27,406
SO I JUST WALTZ UP TO MY DAD
AND SAY "I'M GAY".

202
00:07:27,489 --> 00:07:28,824
AND THEN WHAT?

203
00:07:28,907 --> 00:07:30,909
WELL... OKAY.
FIRST?

204
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:32,995
HE'LL LOSE IT.

205
00:07:33,078 --> 00:07:34,830
IT'LL GET NASTY
AND UGLY.

206
00:07:34,913 --> 00:07:36,915
BUT... THEN IN TIME,

207
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:40,169
HE'LL SEE IT'S
WHO YOU REALLY ARE.

208
00:07:40,252 --> 00:07:41,211
AND HE'LL WAKE UP
ONE MORNING

209
00:07:41,295 --> 00:07:44,214
AND HE'LL SAY
"MY SON'S GAY,

210
00:07:45,174 --> 00:07:47,509
AND THAT'S ALL RIGHT".

211
00:07:49,052 --> 00:07:50,053
OKAY.

212
00:07:51,138 --> 00:07:52,973
I'M GONNA DO IT.

213
00:07:54,224 --> 00:07:56,602
I'M GONNA DO IT, MARCO.

214
00:07:56,685 --> 00:07:58,729
I'M GONNA TELL HIM.

215
00:08:03,066 --> 00:08:04,234
PETER:
THE BAND IS GONNA BE
REALLY GOOD.

216
00:08:04,318 --> 00:08:05,068
THEY'RE GONNA PLAY SOME HITS

217
00:08:05,152 --> 00:08:06,361
AND SOME OF THEIR OWN STUFF.

218
00:08:06,445 --> 00:08:07,321
IT'S GONNA BE GOOD.

219
00:08:07,404 --> 00:08:08,822
THE GUITARIST IS SO GOOD.

220
00:08:08,906 --> 00:08:10,574
MY FRIEND IS A DRUM-

221
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:13,202
AM I INTERRUPTING?

222
00:08:13,285 --> 00:08:14,453
ONLY SLIGHTLY.

223
00:08:15,078 --> 00:08:16,371
LOOK, MY DAD'S GOING TO BE
OUT OF TOWN

224
00:08:16,455 --> 00:08:18,498
SO THERE'S NOTHING IN THE WAY
OF US HAVING FUN.

225
00:08:18,582 --> 00:08:19,082
JUST COME.

226
00:08:19,166 --> 00:08:20,209
'KAY.

227
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:23,170
YOU'RE HAVING A PARTY?

228
00:08:23,253 --> 00:08:24,546
YOU'RE BUSY WITH THE FESTIVAL,
REMEMBER?

229
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:27,090
WHICH I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU'RE BAILING ON.

230
00:08:27,174 --> 00:08:29,801
I'VE MORE THAN ENOUGH DRAMA
IN MY LIFE THESE DAYS.

231
00:08:29,885 --> 00:08:32,262
WHAT'S THAT
SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

232
00:08:32,346 --> 00:08:33,931
YOU BLOW HOT AND COLD,
EMMA.

233
00:08:34,014 --> 00:08:36,225
YOU FLIRT,
AND THEN YOU SHUT ME DOWN.

234
00:08:36,308 --> 00:08:37,809
FACE IT,
YOU'RE A TEASE.

235
00:08:37,893 --> 00:08:40,062
WELL, YOU'RE A JERK.

236
00:08:48,403 --> 00:08:49,905
(KNOCK AT THE DOOR)

237
00:08:58,121 --> 00:08:58,997
OH TIM?

238
00:08:59,081 --> 00:09:00,541
WHAT'RE YOU DOING HERE?

239
00:09:00,624 --> 00:09:01,375
I'M SORRY, MARCO.

240
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:05,128
I GOT YOUR ADDRESS OFF
THE PLAY CONTACT LIST.

241
00:09:05,212 --> 00:09:07,047
I HAVE NOWHERE
ELSE TO GO.

242
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:08,674
LOOK, I DID IT
JUST LIKE YOU SAID.

243
00:09:08,757 --> 00:09:11,385
I COME OUT TO MY DAD
AND HE KICKED ME OUT.

244
00:09:11,468 --> 00:09:12,845
HE ACTUALLY KICKED ME OUT.
(CRYING)

245
00:09:12,928 --> 00:09:16,765
MR. DEL ROSSI:
MARCO, WHAT'S GOING ON
IN HERE?

246
00:09:16,849 --> 00:09:18,016
NOTHING.

247
00:09:18,559 --> 00:09:20,102
PA, THIS IS MY FRIEND,
TIM.

248
00:09:20,185 --> 00:09:21,895
HE'S UPSET.

249
00:09:21,979 --> 00:09:23,063
MRS. DEL ROSSI:
LET'S GO BACK
TO THE DINNING ROOM.

250
00:09:23,146 --> 00:09:24,481
NO. NO.

251
00:09:24,565 --> 00:09:26,066
I'M SORRY FOR BARGING IN
LIKE THIS.

252
00:09:26,149 --> 00:09:27,484
IT'S JUST...

253
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,611
I JUST CAME OUT
TO MY DAD.

254
00:09:30,279 --> 00:09:31,238
CAME OUT?

255
00:09:31,321 --> 00:09:32,155
CAME OUT WHERE?

256
00:09:33,031 --> 00:09:36,076
MARCO:
NO, HE GOT INTO A FIGHT
WITH HIS DAD

257
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:38,161
OVER THE UH...
THE PLAY.

258
00:09:39,079 --> 00:09:43,500
HIS DAD-HIS DAD JUST DOESN'T
LIKE HIM BEING AN ACTOR.

259
00:09:44,042 --> 00:09:45,169
I CAN UNDERSTAND.

260
00:09:45,252 --> 00:09:46,795
ACTING IS NOT A REAL JOB.

261
00:09:46,879 --> 00:09:48,422
IT'S FOR THE...
(WHISTLES)

262
00:09:48,505 --> 00:09:49,298
PAPA?

263
00:09:49,381 --> 00:09:50,841
CAN YOU LEAVE US ALONE,
PLEASE?

264
00:09:56,972 --> 00:09:59,141
TIM. OKAY,
LET ME EXPLAIN THIS-

265
00:10:00,809 --> 00:10:01,852
DON'T, MARCO.

266
00:10:04,146 --> 00:10:05,063
JUST DON'T.

267
00:10:12,446 --> 00:10:15,949
TIM. WE'LL SEE YOU
AGAIN TONIGHT?

268
00:10:16,033 --> 00:10:17,784
YEAH.
HEY, MY MOM'S RIGHT.

269
00:10:17,868 --> 00:10:19,745
YOU'RE MORE THAN WELCOME
TO STAY HERE.

270
00:10:19,828 --> 00:10:22,623
IT'D MAKE ME FEEL BETTER.
I FEEL KINDA RESPONSIBLE.

271
00:10:22,706 --> 00:10:23,749
MR. DEL ROSSI:
RESPONSIBLE?

272
00:10:23,832 --> 00:10:25,083
WHAT DID YOU DO?

273
00:10:25,167 --> 00:10:27,211
MARCO:
NOTHING, PA.

274
00:10:27,294 --> 00:10:30,172
I JUST...TALKED TIM
INTO JOINING THE CAST.

275
00:10:30,255 --> 00:10:31,965
MR. DEL ROSSI:
YEAH, TIM...

276
00:10:32,049 --> 00:10:33,509
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

277
00:10:33,592 --> 00:10:36,094
I DON'T MUCH LIKE ACTING,
BUT YOUR FATHER,

278
00:10:36,178 --> 00:10:38,013
HE KICKED YOU OUT
BECAUSE OF THAT?

279
00:10:38,096 --> 00:10:41,391
TIM:
YOU SEE MY FATHER THINKS
ACTING'S A WASTE OF TIME.

280
00:10:41,475 --> 00:10:42,684
WHAT DO YOU THINK,
MARCO?

281
00:10:42,768 --> 00:10:43,727
YOU KNOW,
ABOUT ACTING?

282
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:47,606
ABOUT PRETENDING TO BE
SOMEONE YOU'RE NOT?

283
00:10:47,689 --> 00:10:48,273
I DON'T KNOW, BUD.

284
00:10:48,357 --> 00:10:51,109
I GUESS YOU JUST GOTTA PLAY
THE PART AS WRITTEN.

285
00:10:51,193 --> 00:10:53,862
YEAH,
BUT YOU'RE SO GOOD AT IT.

286
00:10:53,946 --> 00:10:55,030
I MEAN, WHEN YOU ACT,

287
00:10:55,113 --> 00:10:56,240
YOU'RE IT'S LIKE PACINO.

288
00:10:56,323 --> 00:10:57,950
YOU FOOL EVERYBODY.

289
00:10:58,825 --> 00:11:01,328
THANK YOU.
I HAVE TO GO.

290
00:11:03,789 --> 00:11:05,916
MOM, DAD,
HERE ARE THE TICKETS.

291
00:11:05,999 --> 00:11:08,001
FESTIVAL STARTS AT NOON.

292
00:11:13,924 --> 00:11:16,093
IL DETESTE LA PLUIE.

293
00:11:18,679 --> 00:11:21,098
HOW DO I SPELL DETESTE?
DETESTE...

294
00:11:21,181 --> 00:11:23,016
EMMA:
DETESTE AS IN HATE?

295
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:23,934
P-E-T-E-R.

296
00:11:24,893 --> 00:11:27,604
OKAY, THAT'S AT LEAST
TEN PETER REFERENCES

297
00:11:27,688 --> 00:11:29,815
IN THE LAST TWO HOURS.

298
00:11:29,898 --> 00:11:31,733
I JUST HATE
WHAT HE DID TO YOU.

299
00:11:31,817 --> 00:11:34,069
AND WAITING FOR KARMA TO GET HIM
IS BORING ME.

300
00:11:35,779 --> 00:11:36,655
IT WON'T ACTUALLY BE KARMA.

301
00:11:36,738 --> 00:11:38,365
IT'LL BE A GIRL.

302
00:11:38,448 --> 00:11:40,117
ACHILLES HEEL, LIKE.

303
00:11:42,703 --> 00:11:45,372
MANUELLA,
VOUS ETES UN GENIUS!

304
00:11:45,455 --> 00:11:46,790
AN EYE FOR AN EYE.

305
00:11:46,874 --> 00:11:48,458
BABY,
THAT'S A TELEPHONE,

306
00:11:48,542 --> 00:11:49,293
AND YOU MIGHT WANT
TO USE IT

307
00:11:49,376 --> 00:11:50,502
TO CALL THE MEN
IN WHITE COATS

308
00:11:50,586 --> 00:11:52,004
BECAUSE THEY PICK UP.

309
00:11:52,087 --> 00:11:54,464
IT'S A CAMERA PHONE.

310
00:11:54,548 --> 00:11:55,799
SO...?

311
00:11:55,883 --> 00:11:58,427
SO PETER NEEDS TO LEARN
THAT PAYBACKS ARE HELL,

312
00:11:58,510 --> 00:11:59,511
AND I HAPPEN TO THINK

313
00:11:59,595 --> 00:12:01,138
HE NEEDS TO LEARN IT
FROM US.

314
00:12:01,221 --> 00:12:03,390
AND THAT'S WHY YOU'RE
MY BESTEST FRIEND

315
00:12:03,473 --> 00:12:05,225
IN THE WHOLE
WIDE WORLD.

316
00:12:05,309 --> 00:12:06,518
SMILE FOR
A PICTURE.

317
00:12:06,602 --> 00:12:07,686
CHEESE.

318
00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:14,234
NERVOUS?

319
00:12:14,318 --> 00:12:15,485
YEAH.

320
00:12:15,569 --> 00:12:17,654
BUT NOT BECAUSE
OF THE PLAY THOUGH.

321
00:12:17,738 --> 00:12:20,157
TIM STAYED OVER
LAST NIGHT.

322
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,700
I HOPE YOU WERE SAFE.

323
00:12:21,783 --> 00:12:23,076
WHAT? NO!

324
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:24,286
TOTALLY MISSING
THE POINT.

325
00:12:24,369 --> 00:12:27,414
LOOK,
HE CAME OUT TO HIS DAD.

326
00:12:27,497 --> 00:12:28,498
WHO THEN,
GET THIS,

327
00:12:28,582 --> 00:12:31,084
PROMPTLY KICKED
HIM OUT.

328
00:12:31,168 --> 00:12:32,085
WOW.

329
00:12:32,711 --> 00:12:34,922
I JUST WENT FROM
EXCITEMENT TO HORROR

330
00:12:35,005 --> 00:12:36,548
IN FIVE SECONDS.

331
00:12:36,632 --> 00:12:38,800
ACTING HAS PUT ME IN TOUCH
WITH MY EMOTIONS.

332
00:12:38,884 --> 00:12:41,595
PAIGE,
THIS IS SO MY FAULT.

333
00:12:42,763 --> 00:12:43,555
OKAY...

334
00:12:43,639 --> 00:12:46,517
WELL, I KIND OF
MADE HIM THINK

335
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,685
THAT I ALREADY
WAS OUT TO MY DAD.

336
00:12:48,769 --> 00:12:49,978
YOUR DAD?

337
00:12:50,062 --> 00:12:52,397
THE GUY WHO THINKS YOU LISTEN
TO BRITNEY IN THE CAR

338
00:12:52,481 --> 00:12:54,358
BECAUSE IT PUTS CHICKS
IN THE MOOD?

339
00:12:54,441 --> 00:12:55,359
I KNOW.

340
00:12:55,442 --> 00:12:57,069
I WAS JUST TRYING
TO HELP HIM, OKAY?

341
00:12:57,152 --> 00:12:58,362
INSPIRE HIM.

342
00:12:58,445 --> 00:13:00,948
BE HIS MENTOR;
HIS YODA.

343
00:13:02,241 --> 00:13:04,117
TOO LATE,
IT IS NOT.

344
00:13:04,201 --> 00:13:05,202
HMM.
YEAH.

345
00:13:05,285 --> 00:13:08,497
BELIEVE ME,
IT DEFINITELY IS.

346
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:10,040
(SIGHS)

347
00:13:10,123 --> 00:13:11,708
TIM HATES ME.

348
00:13:12,376 --> 00:13:13,627
HE WON'T.

349
00:13:14,294 --> 00:13:17,965
NOT AFTER YOU COME OUT
TO YOUR FATHER.

350
00:13:22,135 --> 00:13:24,137
(DANCE MUSIC)

351
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:44,449
EMMA.

352
00:13:45,325 --> 00:13:47,202
WERE YOU EXPECTING
SOMEONE ELSE?

353
00:13:47,286 --> 00:13:49,746
NOT EXPECTING;
MAYBE HOPING.

354
00:13:49,830 --> 00:13:52,416
WELL, I WAS HOPING
YOU'D ACCEPT AN APOLOGY.

355
00:13:52,499 --> 00:13:55,210
I WAS BEING UNFAIR
SENDING MIXED SIGNALS.

356
00:13:55,294 --> 00:13:57,880
SO WHAT'S THE SIGNAL NOW?

357
00:13:58,380 --> 00:14:00,048
GREEN FOR GO.

358
00:14:00,841 --> 00:14:03,427
LET'S SEE
WHAT WE CAN DO.

359
00:14:12,519 --> 00:14:13,353
(APPLAUSE)

360
00:14:23,363 --> 00:14:25,115
THAT WAS A SCENE
FROM "PYGMALION",

361
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:27,451
PLAYED BY DAVID JONES
AND JEN WALKER

362
00:14:27,534 --> 00:14:29,453
FROM CARSON HILL.

363
00:14:29,536 --> 00:14:31,038
MR. SIMPSON,
YOU GOTTA BREATH.

364
00:14:35,459 --> 00:14:37,461
AND BY A SLEEP TO SAY
WE END THE HEARTACHE.

365
00:14:37,544 --> 00:14:38,587
BY THE THOUSAND-

366
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:40,047
AND THE THOU...

367
00:14:43,175 --> 00:14:44,676
MARCO?
YOU CALLED?

368
00:14:46,428 --> 00:14:47,930
I DID.
YEAH.

369
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:50,390
PA, WE NEED TO TALK.

370
00:14:50,474 --> 00:14:51,391
SURE.

371
00:14:58,440 --> 00:14:59,691
BEFORE THE PLAY STARTS,

372
00:14:59,775 --> 00:15:03,779
PA, THERE'S SOMETHING THAT
I NEED TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT.

373
00:15:03,862 --> 00:15:06,615
IT'S ACTUALLY
ABOUT TIM.

374
00:15:06,698 --> 00:15:09,159
I'VE BEEN HELPING HIM
LATELY

375
00:15:09,243 --> 00:15:11,411
BECAUSE HE'S YOUNGER

376
00:15:12,037 --> 00:15:14,039
AND HE'S CONFUSED.

377
00:15:17,417 --> 00:15:18,418
HE'S GAY.

378
00:15:18,919 --> 00:15:20,420
AND TIM THOUGHT
THAT YOU-

379
00:15:20,504 --> 00:15:22,130
NO. YOU BROUGHT HIM
INTO MY HOUSE?

380
00:15:22,214 --> 00:15:23,423
NO PA, I'M TRYING
TO TELL YOU SOMETHING.

381
00:15:23,507 --> 00:15:23,799
I DON'T WANT
TO HEAR IT!

382
00:15:23,882 --> 00:15:25,509
IT'S NOT ABOUT TIM.

383
00:15:25,592 --> 00:15:26,426
THAT BOY IS GOING HOME.

384
00:15:26,510 --> 00:15:28,262
I DO NOT WANT A QUEER
UNDER MY ROOF.

385
00:15:28,345 --> 00:15:31,306
WHAT IF YOU ALREADY
HAVE ONE?

386
00:15:35,018 --> 00:15:36,436
YOU'LL BE LATE
FOR YOUR PLAY.

387
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:37,312
MARCO:
PA.

388
00:15:37,396 --> 00:15:38,438
I GOTTA GO
FIND YOUR MOTHER.

389
00:15:38,522 --> 00:15:39,398
I-I DON'T KNOW
WHERE SHE IS.

390
00:15:39,481 --> 00:15:40,190
YOU KNOW HOW SHE IS.

391
00:15:40,274 --> 00:15:41,275
SHE GETS LOST SO EASILY.

392
00:15:41,358 --> 00:15:42,651
MARCO:
WHAT? YOU'RE GONNA PRETEND-

393
00:15:42,734 --> 00:15:44,444
YOU GONNA PRETEND THAT
I DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING TO YOU?

394
00:15:44,528 --> 00:15:44,778
PA!

395
00:15:47,865 --> 00:15:49,366
BOY:
WE GOT TO GO.

396
00:15:50,701 --> 00:15:53,787
CRAIG:
AND THY BEST GRACES
SPEND IT AT THY WILL!

397
00:15:53,871 --> 00:15:57,040
BUT NOW, MY COUSIN HAMLET,
AND MY SON-

398
00:16:00,377 --> 00:16:01,003
HAMLET?!

399
00:16:18,604 --> 00:16:22,232
A LITTLE MORE THAN KIN,
AND LESS THAN KIND.

400
00:16:31,950 --> 00:16:32,951
PETER:
WOW.

401
00:16:35,078 --> 00:16:36,872
EMMA:
UNDO SOME THINGS-

402
00:16:36,955 --> 00:16:38,457
NO, SILLY, ON YOU.

403
00:16:40,834 --> 00:16:42,252
PETER:
I'M UH...

404
00:16:42,336 --> 00:16:43,962
I'M SORRY ABOUT THE ROOM
OR WHATEVER.

405
00:16:44,046 --> 00:16:45,172
EMMA:
IT'S OKAY.
UH...

406
00:16:45,255 --> 00:16:46,298
CAN WE JUST...

407
00:16:46,381 --> 00:16:47,966
PETER:
IT'S JUST,
UM, I HATE IT.

408
00:16:48,050 --> 00:16:48,967
EMMA:
WHAT ABOUT YOUR BELT?

409
00:16:49,051 --> 00:16:49,885
PETER:
NO.

410
00:16:51,053 --> 00:16:55,390
I JUST WISH I COULD TAKE YOU
SOMEPLACE BETTER.

411
00:16:55,474 --> 00:16:58,018
IT'S JUST MY DAD PRACTICALLY
USES THIS PLACE

412
00:16:58,101 --> 00:16:59,895
AS A STORAGE LOCKER.

413
00:16:59,978 --> 00:17:01,063
THREW ME IN HERE
WITH EVERYTHING ELSE

414
00:17:01,146 --> 00:17:02,981
HE DOESN'T WANT.

415
00:17:07,110 --> 00:17:10,739
EMMA:
WOW. YOU HAVE NO PRIVATE SPACE.

416
00:17:12,115 --> 00:17:13,951
I CAN'T DO THIS.

417
00:17:16,703 --> 00:17:18,288
MY ROOM,
SINCE THE BABY?

418
00:17:18,372 --> 00:17:20,040
I'M STUCK IN THE BASEMENT
WITH THE LAUNDRY

419
00:17:20,123 --> 00:17:22,042
AND THE MOULD
AND SNAKE'S OLD BOWLING SHOES.

420
00:17:22,125 --> 00:17:23,460
SO I CAN RELATE.

421
00:17:32,970 --> 00:17:34,555
I NEED TO GO.

422
00:17:49,653 --> 00:17:51,613
MARCO:
ALAS, POOR YORICK.

423
00:17:51,697 --> 00:17:53,615
I KNEW HIM, HORATIO.

424
00:17:53,699 --> 00:17:58,120
HE HATH BORE ME ON HIS BACK
A THOUSAND TIMES AND NOW...

425
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:00,664
HOW ABHORRED.

426
00:18:02,165 --> 00:18:05,252
HOW ABHORRED
IN MY IMAGINATION IT IS.

427
00:18:08,297 --> 00:18:10,549
MY GORGE RISES AT IT.

428
00:18:11,091 --> 00:18:13,760
AND HERE HUNG THOSE LIPS
THAT I-

429
00:18:16,346 --> 00:18:17,181
I'M SORRY.

430
00:18:18,348 --> 00:18:19,349
SORRY.

431
00:18:20,434 --> 00:18:21,935
I HAVE TO DO THIS.

432
00:18:28,066 --> 00:18:28,400
DAD?

433
00:18:32,946 --> 00:18:33,614
I'M GAY.

434
00:18:40,621 --> 00:18:43,123
PAIGE:
WAY TO GO, MARCO!

435
00:18:50,297 --> 00:18:51,965
HERE HUNG THOSE LIPS

436
00:18:53,717 --> 00:18:56,887
THAT I HAVE KISSED
I KNOW NOT HOW OFT.

437
00:19:06,146 --> 00:19:09,483
DID YOU GET AWESOME SHOTS
OF HIS FLAT GOOFY BUTT?

438
00:19:10,984 --> 00:19:12,069
DOES HILARITY ENSUE?

439
00:19:12,152 --> 00:19:13,779
WILL I LAUGH, CRY, PEE?

440
00:19:13,862 --> 00:19:14,947
EMMA:
MANNY, IT DIDN'T WORK.

441
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:15,781
NO!

442
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:17,699
HE BARELY NOTICED ME.

443
00:19:17,783 --> 00:19:20,536
I GUESS, I'M A LOUSY
BOND GIRL.

444
00:19:20,619 --> 00:19:21,954
WE'LL GET HIM NEXT TIME,
DON'T WORRY.

445
00:19:22,037 --> 00:19:24,581
AND WE'LL PUT LAXATIVES
IN HIS FOOD,

446
00:19:24,665 --> 00:19:28,418
RIGHT BEFORE A TEST
AND KABBBBLAAM!

447
00:19:28,502 --> 00:19:30,337
THAT'D BE FUNNY.

448
00:19:53,569 --> 00:19:57,698
MRS. DEL ROSSI:
MARCO, HOW WAS THE REST
OF THE PLAY?

449
00:19:57,781 --> 00:20:00,117
MARCO:
AFTER MY LITTLE BIT OF IMPROV?

450
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:02,035
IT'S NOT BAD, I GUESS.

451
00:20:02,953 --> 00:20:04,621
WE DIDN'T WIN.

452
00:20:05,873 --> 00:20:08,125
I HAVE WORK EARLY TOMORROW.

453
00:20:09,710 --> 00:20:12,963
SO WE'RE NOT GOING
TO TALK ABOUT THIS?

454
00:20:13,046 --> 00:20:15,757
I AM TOO TIRED
FOR TALKING.

455
00:20:16,466 --> 00:20:17,718
NO, PA, STOP.

456
00:20:17,801 --> 00:20:18,719
STOP.

457
00:20:22,347 --> 00:20:24,725
DID YOU EVER KNOW, HUH?

458
00:20:26,727 --> 00:20:27,269
ALL THESE YEARS.

459
00:20:27,352 --> 00:20:30,397
PA, DID YOU EVER KNOW
THAT I WAS GAY?

460
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:31,315
STOP SAYING THAT.

461
00:20:31,398 --> 00:20:32,983
I CAN'T.

462
00:20:33,066 --> 00:20:37,237
PA, IT'S TAKEN ME
SEVENTEEN YEARS TO SAY IT.

463
00:20:37,821 --> 00:20:39,698
I'M GAY.
GAY.

464
00:20:39,781 --> 00:20:41,408
I AM TOTALLY GAY!

465
00:20:41,491 --> 00:20:42,409
THIS IS FUNNY TO YOU?!

466
00:20:42,492 --> 00:20:43,744
NO!

467
00:20:43,827 --> 00:20:45,495
NO, PA, THIS IS NOT FUNNY
AT ALL!

468
00:20:45,579 --> 00:20:48,624
I JUST CAME OUT TO YOU
IN FRONT OF THE ENTIRE SCHOOL!

469
00:20:48,707 --> 00:20:51,919
DOES THAT SOUND LIKE
A JOKE TO YOU?

470
00:20:52,002 --> 00:20:54,087
LOOK,
YOU'RE MY BOY

471
00:20:55,422 --> 00:20:57,216
AND I LOVE YOU.

472
00:20:57,299 --> 00:20:59,760
YOU'RE THE BEST SON
A FATHER COULD EVER WANT.

473
00:20:59,843 --> 00:21:02,179
BUT THIS PART OF YOU
I DON'T WANT TO KNOW.

474
00:21:02,262 --> 00:21:03,388
I CAN'T KNOW ABOUT.

475
00:21:03,472 --> 00:21:06,558
THEN YOU DON'T WANT
TO KNOW ME.

476
00:21:15,567 --> 00:21:16,151
(SIGHS)

477
00:21:19,488 --> 00:21:21,240
HE WILL, MARCO.

478
00:21:22,491 --> 00:21:23,659
ONE DAY.

479
00:21:28,330 --> 00:21:29,289
YEAH.

480
00:21:30,791 --> 00:21:32,042
ONE DAY.
