00:00:03,003 --> 00:00:04,671
JT:
SO WHAT NOW, MS. SAUVE?

2
00:00:04,755 --> 00:00:07,216
PREGNANCY YOGA?
LAMAZE CLASS?

3
00:00:07,299 --> 00:00:08,842
MAKE A DOCTOR'S APPOINTMENT.

4
00:00:08,926 --> 00:00:09,718
AT THIS POINT,

5
00:00:09,801 --> 00:00:11,094
THE HEALTH OF THE BABY
IS PARAMOUNT.

6
00:00:12,763 --> 00:00:14,515
SO WHO KNOWS?

7
00:00:14,598 --> 00:00:16,683
ONLY MY BROTHER
AND TOBY.

8
00:00:18,185 --> 00:00:19,019
NOT YOUR PARENTS?

9
00:00:20,771 --> 00:00:22,356
LIBERTY,
YOU'RE 6 MONTHS PREGNANT.

10
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:23,982
I KNOW, MS. SAUVE.

11

(SIGHS)

12
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:26,318
BUT MY FATHER...

13
00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:28,862
THERE'S NO WAY
I CAN TELL HIM.

14
00:00:28,946 --> 00:00:32,157
SO YOU'VE JUST BEEN
HIDING IT?

15
00:00:32,241 --> 00:00:34,284
WELL,
LET'S TALK ABOUT OPTIONS.

16
00:00:34,368 --> 00:00:36,036
IT'S LATE IN THE GAME
FOR AN ABORTION,

17
00:00:36,119 --> 00:00:37,913
SO I ASSUME THAT'S OFF
THE TABLE.

18
00:00:37,996 --> 00:00:38,956
ABSOLUTELY.

19
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:41,959
I WANT TO CARRY THIS BABY
TO TERM.

20
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:43,544
BUT AFTERWARDS...?

21
00:00:44,253 --> 00:00:47,256
LIBERTY, THERE IS
NO AFTERWARDS, OKAY?

22
00:00:47,339 --> 00:00:48,298
WHAT ABOUT ADOPTION?

23
00:00:49,633 --> 00:00:52,302
I CAN REFER YOU
TO AN AGENCY.

24
00:00:52,386 --> 00:00:53,554
JT:
YES, THAT'S PERFECT.

25
00:00:53,637 --> 00:00:54,346
WE'RE IN.

26
00:00:55,097 --> 00:00:55,347
WE?

27
00:00:57,015 --> 00:00:58,517
JT, YOU BROKE UP
WITH ME.

28
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:00,519
YEAH,
BUT I'M STILL THE FATHER.

29
00:01:00,602 --> 00:01:01,645
IF YOU DECIDE TO KEEP
THIS BABY,

30
00:01:01,728 --> 00:01:04,523
THEN IT BECOMES
MY PROBLEM TOO.

31
00:01:04,606 --> 00:01:05,732
SAUVE:
SO, DO YOU WANT ME
TO REFER YOU

32
00:01:05,816 --> 00:01:07,484
TO AN ADOPTION AGENCY
OR NOT?

33
00:01:07,568 --> 00:01:08,068
YES.

34
00:01:08,151 --> 00:01:08,443
NO.

35
00:01:10,696 --> 00:01:12,281
SOUNDS LIKE
YOU HAVE A PROBLEM.

181
00:07:49,219 --> 00:07:50,470
GOBBLE, GOBBLE, GOBBLE,
GOBBLE, GOBBLE, GOBBLE...

182
00:07:52,055 --> 00:07:53,473
THAT IS SO CUTE!

183
00:07:54,183 --> 00:07:55,475
SHE'S RIGHT.

184
00:07:55,559 --> 00:07:58,270
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME
ABOUT THIS?

185
00:07:58,353 --> 00:07:59,771
YOU'VE ALWAYS WANTED
TO BE ON TV,

186
00:07:59,855 --> 00:08:01,773
AND THERE YOU ARE.

187
00:08:05,611 --> 00:08:07,571
SO DO YOU WANNA TELL HER
OR SHOULD I?

188
00:08:07,654 --> 00:08:09,156
CRAIG:
OKAY, I'LL TELL HER.
WELL...

189
00:08:09,239 --> 00:08:09,865
NO, NO, NO
YOU TELL HER.

190
00:08:09,948 --> 00:08:11,033
YOU TELL HER -
IT'S TOO GOOD.

191
00:08:11,116 --> 00:08:12,618
(CONTINUE ARGUING)

192
00:08:16,872 --> 00:08:18,332
CRAIG AND I,

193
00:08:18,415 --> 00:08:19,917
WE MET THIS REALLY
CUTE GUY.

194
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,503
AND HE'S TOTALLY
YOUR TYPE.

195
00:08:22,586 --> 00:08:24,004
WELL,
CUTE IS MY TYPE.

196
00:08:24,087 --> 00:08:25,672
CRAIG:
HIS NAME IS DEREK.

197
00:08:25,756 --> 00:08:27,341
HE'S A BASKETBALL BUDDY
OF JIMMY'S.

198
00:08:27,424 --> 00:08:29,009
HE'S IN GRADE 10,

199
00:08:29,092 --> 00:08:30,677
BUT HE'S ALL RIGHT.

200
00:08:32,971 --> 00:08:34,598
HEY DEREK!

201
00:08:34,681 --> 00:08:35,766
WEIRD. WEIRD.

202
00:08:36,683 --> 00:08:38,101
I MEAN,
IT'S-IT'S COSMIC.

203
00:08:38,185 --> 00:08:39,853
WE WERE JUST TALKING
ABOUT YOU.

204
00:08:39,937 --> 00:08:40,854
AMAZING.

205
00:08:40,938 --> 00:08:42,564
YOU'D THINK
IT WAS A SETUP.

206
00:08:42,648 --> 00:08:43,774
MANNY:
DEREK,

207
00:08:43,857 --> 00:08:46,860
THIS IS MY SINGLE FRIEND,
EMMA.

208
00:08:46,944 --> 00:08:48,195
DID I MENTION
THAT SHE'S SINGLE?

209
00:08:49,112 --> 00:08:50,405
HEY EMMA.

210
00:08:52,282 --> 00:08:53,742
UM, THESE GUYS
WERE TELLING ME

211
00:08:53,825 --> 00:08:55,869
THAT YOUR PARENTS USED
TO GO TO DEGRASSI?

212
00:08:55,953 --> 00:08:57,246
IT'S PRETTY WEIRD, EH?

213
00:08:57,329 --> 00:08:59,623
IT'S A MAGICAL STORY.

214
00:09:05,462 --> 00:09:08,090
I'LL TELL YOU
ALL ABOUT IT FRIDAY.

215
00:09:08,173 --> 00:09:09,591
UH, FRIDAY?

216
00:09:11,468 --> 00:09:13,387
LIKE, AT NIGHT?

217
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:14,972
IT'S A DATE.

218
00:09:25,274 --> 00:09:27,276
HOW DOES HE
OR SHE LOOK?

219
00:09:32,656 --> 00:09:33,699
I DON'T KNOW.

220
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:36,118
I CAN'T.

221
00:09:39,371 --> 00:09:40,330
JT, PLEASE.

222
00:09:52,509 --> 00:09:52,801
IT...

223
00:09:54,428 --> 00:09:55,179
IT LOOKS...

224
00:09:57,306 --> 00:09:57,681
REAL.

225
00:10:04,104 --> 00:10:05,606
PASSED WITH
FLYING COLOURS.

226
00:10:05,689 --> 00:10:07,774
LIKE MOTHER,
LIKE OFFSPRING.

227
00:10:07,858 --> 00:10:08,775
THEY'LL BE HAPPY
TO HEAR THAT

228
00:10:08,859 --> 00:10:10,819
AT THE ADOPTION AGENCY.

229
00:10:10,903 --> 00:10:12,112
REALLY?

230
00:10:12,196 --> 00:10:13,280
YOU'RE SURE?

231
00:10:13,363 --> 00:10:13,780
NO.

232
00:10:13,864 --> 00:10:15,532
I DON'T WANT TO
GIVE OUR BABY UP,

233
00:10:15,616 --> 00:10:17,951
BUT YOU DO,
OBVIOUSLY.

234
00:10:19,745 --> 00:10:22,581
LIBERTY,
IT'S NOT THAT EASY.

235
00:10:24,541 --> 00:10:26,793
WE HAVE LIVES AHEAD OF US -

236
00:10:28,879 --> 00:10:30,714
SCHOOL AND JOBS.

237
00:10:32,049 --> 00:10:33,967
SO?
WE CAN DO IT.

238
00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:35,844
ALL OF IT.

239
00:10:40,807 --> 00:10:42,601
WHAT WAS THAT FOR?

240
00:10:42,684 --> 00:10:45,229
BECAUSE YOU NEEDED IT.

241
00:10:45,312 --> 00:10:46,230
LOOK...

242
00:10:47,523 --> 00:10:49,233
I LOVE YOU, JT.

243
00:10:50,859 --> 00:10:53,695
AND WHATEVER
YOU WANT TO DO

244
00:10:55,155 --> 00:10:57,074
I'M FINE WITH IT.

245
00:11:06,583 --> 00:11:08,836
LET'S KEEP THIS BABY.

246
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:27,354
BRIGHT AND EARLY,
AS REQUESTED.

247
00:11:27,437 --> 00:11:28,772
MRS. COONEY:
WHO WANTS MUFFINS?

248
00:11:28,856 --> 00:11:30,983
CARROT MUFFINS.
YOUR FAVOURITE.

249
00:11:31,066 --> 00:11:32,109
LIBERTY:
GOOD MORNING,
MRS. COONEY.

250
00:11:32,192 --> 00:11:33,193
MRS. COONEY:
OH LIBERTY,

251
00:11:33,277 --> 00:11:35,988
I AM SO HAPPY
YOU'VE TAKEN THIS ONE BACK.

252
00:11:36,071 --> 00:11:38,240
LUCK OF THE IRISH,
HE'S GOT.

253
00:11:38,323 --> 00:11:40,909
WE'RE BOTH VERY LUCKY.

254
00:11:40,993 --> 00:11:44,663
SPEAKING OF WHICH,
WE HAVE GREAT NEWS.

255
00:11:45,539 --> 00:11:46,540
WE'RE HAVING A BABY.

256
00:11:51,086 --> 00:11:52,963
YOU CAN'T BE SERIOUS.

257
00:11:53,046 --> 00:11:53,797
YEAH, WE ARE.

258
00:11:53,881 --> 00:11:56,550
WE'RE GOING
TO BE PARENTS.

259
00:11:58,510 --> 00:11:59,761
JAMES TIBERIUS,

260
00:12:00,679 --> 00:12:01,805
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA

261
00:12:01,889 --> 00:12:04,558
WHAT IT TAKES
TO RAISE A CHILD?

262
00:12:04,641 --> 00:12:06,894
YOU ARE FAR,
FAR TOO YOUNG.

263
00:12:06,977 --> 00:12:09,730
WELL, I THOUGHT
THAT YOU COULD HELP US.

264
00:12:09,813 --> 00:12:12,441
I MEAN, YOU RAISED MOM
AND ME.

265
00:12:12,524 --> 00:12:14,484
AND I'M NOT PLANNING
TO SPEND MY RETIREMENT

266
00:12:14,568 --> 00:12:16,153
GOING THROUGH IT AGAIN.

267
00:12:16,236 --> 00:12:18,197
HAVE YOU THOUGHT
ABOUT ADOPTION?

268
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:21,116
WE'VE CONSIDERED IT,
BUT NO.

269
00:12:21,742 --> 00:12:24,411
LOOK GRANDMA,
WE LOVE EACH OTHER, OKAY?

270
00:12:24,494 --> 00:12:26,663
THAT'S ALL THAT MATTERS.

271
00:12:26,747 --> 00:12:28,832
AND THE REST
WE'LL FIGURE OUT.

272
00:12:28,916 --> 00:12:30,751
THE WAY YOUR FATHER
FIGURED IT OUT?

273
00:12:30,834 --> 00:12:31,668
BY LEAVING YOU
AND YOUR MOTHER

274
00:12:31,752 --> 00:12:33,879
WHEN THE GOING
GOT ROUGH?

275
00:12:33,962 --> 00:12:35,923
I'M NOT LIKE HIM.

276
00:12:37,758 --> 00:12:39,176
NOT AT ALL.

277
00:12:43,263 --> 00:12:44,306
(SIGHS)

278
00:12:45,641 --> 00:12:46,934
LET'S GO.

279
00:12:58,904 --> 00:13:00,239
EMMA. HEY.

280
00:13:02,491 --> 00:13:02,908
OKAY, LOOK...

281
00:13:02,991 --> 00:13:04,660
IF WE'RE BOTH GONNA BE
THE RELAY FOR LIFE COMMITTEE,

282
00:13:04,743 --> 00:13:07,079
DON'T YOU THINK WE SHOULD BE
A LITTLE BIT MORE CIVILIZED?

283
00:13:07,162 --> 00:13:09,456
IT'S A CANCER RUN,
NOT A TEA PARTY.

284
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:11,208
I KNOW VIDEOTAPING MANNY
WAS STUPID,

285
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:13,210
BUT SHE ASKED ME
TO DO IT.

286
00:13:13,293 --> 00:13:15,796
SHE WAS DRUNK
AND VERY PERSUASIVE.

287
00:13:15,879 --> 00:13:17,214
AND YOU EMAILING IT
TO YOUR FRIENDS

288
00:13:17,297 --> 00:13:18,757
MAKES IT RIGHT?

289
00:13:18,841 --> 00:13:21,134
NO.
OF COURSE NOT.

290
00:13:21,218 --> 00:13:23,512
PLEDGE FORMS FOR ALL YOUR
FABULOUS CANCER-FIGHTING

291
00:13:23,595 --> 00:13:24,972
FRIENDS
AND FAMILY MEMBERS.

292
00:13:25,055 --> 00:13:27,641
LEAVE NO WALLET UNTAPPED.

293
00:13:31,979 --> 00:13:33,981
LOOK, I SHOULD HAVE NEVER
GONE FOR MANNY.

294
00:13:34,064 --> 00:13:37,317
YOU, ON THE OTHER HAND -
MAJOR CATCH.

295
00:13:37,401 --> 00:13:38,986
SMART, FUNNY,

296
00:13:39,528 --> 00:13:40,779
INSANELY GORGEOUS.

297
00:13:40,863 --> 00:13:43,407
WHAT MAKES YOU THINK
I'M INTERESTED?

298
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:44,783
WE CARE ABOUT THINGS,

299
00:13:44,867 --> 00:13:46,535
IMPORTANT THINGS.

300
00:13:46,618 --> 00:13:47,369
MAYBE I HEARD THAT,

301
00:13:47,452 --> 00:13:50,372
ONCE,
YOU WERE KINDA INTO ME.

302
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:53,834
PAIGE:
OKAY, BUTTS IN
THE BLEACHERS PEOPLE.

303
00:13:53,917 --> 00:13:55,919
WE'LL GO OVER THE ROUTE.

304
00:13:58,130 --> 00:13:59,339
THERE'S A MOVIE
TOMORROW NIGHT.

305
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:01,425
7:30 P.M.,
CINEMA 3.

306
00:14:01,508 --> 00:14:03,260
SUPPOSED TO BE FUNNY.

307
00:14:03,343 --> 00:14:05,012
I'LL BE THERE.

308
00:14:05,679 --> 00:14:08,056
DON'T HOLD YOUR BREATH.

309
00:14:10,726 --> 00:14:11,518
WHENEVER YOU'RE READY.

310
00:14:11,602 --> 00:14:14,605
CURING CANCER
CAN ALWAYS WAIT.

311
00:14:17,691 --> 00:14:19,985
LIBERTY:
JT, PLEASE DON'T MAKE ME
DO THIS.

312
00:14:20,068 --> 00:14:21,820
JT:
LIBERTY, WE CAN'T KEEP
AVOIDING THIS, OKAY?

313
00:14:21,904 --> 00:14:23,488
WE HAVE TO TELL YOUR PARENTS.

314
00:14:23,572 --> 00:14:26,074
LIBERTY:
AFTER WHAT HAPPENED
WITH YOUR GRANDMA?

315
00:14:26,158 --> 00:14:27,201
JT:
SO SHE DIDN'T TAKE IT
SO WELL.

316
00:14:27,284 --> 00:14:29,036
LIBERTY:
THAT'S NOTHING, JT,
OKAY?

317
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:30,454
YOUR GRANDMA'S A LAMB.

318
00:14:30,537 --> 00:14:31,663
MY PARENTS ARE LIONS.

319
00:14:31,747 --> 00:14:33,081
JT:
WELL, LIBERTY,
YOU'RE THEIR DAUGHTER.

320
00:14:33,165 --> 00:14:35,292
MAYBE THEY'LL UNDERSTAND.

321
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:37,461
LIBERTY:
IT'S NOT MY MOTHER,
IT'S MY FATHER.

322
00:14:37,544 --> 00:14:40,130
HE'LL KICK ME OUT,
GUARANTEED.

323
00:14:40,881 --> 00:14:41,924
(SIGHS)

324
00:14:42,925 --> 00:14:45,093
WELL, LET HIM, OKAY?

325
00:14:45,594 --> 00:14:47,513
BECAUSE WE'RE GOING
TO GET OUR OWN PLACE.

326
00:14:47,596 --> 00:14:49,223
YOU, ME AND THE BABY.

327
00:14:49,306 --> 00:14:51,058
YOU'RE SERIOUS?

328
00:14:52,059 --> 00:14:53,560
I GUESS I COULD USE
MY SPELLING BEE MONEY.

329
00:14:53,644 --> 00:14:54,811
YEAH.

330
00:14:54,895 --> 00:14:57,147
AND I'LL TAKE MORE SHIFTS
AT THE PHARMACY.

331
00:14:57,231 --> 00:14:59,316
AND I'LL QUIT
THE TV JOB.

332
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:00,943
JT, YOU CAN'T.

333
00:15:01,026 --> 00:15:02,152
NO, I HAVE TO,

334
00:15:02,236 --> 00:15:04,988
BECAUSE IT DOESN'T PAY.

335
00:15:05,072 --> 00:15:08,492
BESIDES, THEY CAN JUST GET
SOMEONE ELSE TO MAKE TIARAS.

336
00:15:08,575 --> 00:15:09,743
IT'S FINE.

337
00:15:09,826 --> 00:15:12,412
SO... WE'RE NOT
TELLING THEM?

338
00:15:12,496 --> 00:15:13,789
NO. NOT YET.

339
00:15:13,872 --> 00:15:15,082
BECAUSE BEFORE WE JUMP,

340
00:15:16,542 --> 00:15:19,002
WE'D BETTER HAVE
A SAFETY NET.
