00:00:10,761 --> 00:00:12,804
MANNY:
UM, MR. SIMPSON,
CAN YOU KEEP IT DOWN?

4
00:00:12,888 --> 00:00:15,390
IT'S LONG DISTANCE
WITH CRAIG.

5
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:17,893
YOU HAVEN'T LET ME
BRUSH YOUR HAIR

6
00:00:17,976 --> 00:00:19,728
SINCE YOU WERE TEN.

7
00:00:19,811 --> 00:00:21,605
I WISH I WAS TEN.

8
00:00:21,688 --> 00:00:23,398
YOU DON'T HAVE
A TIME MACHINE, DO YOU?

9
00:00:23,482 --> 00:00:26,109
I'M AFRAID I DON'T,
KIDDO.

10
00:00:26,902 --> 00:00:28,946
WHEN DID IT ALL GET
SO COMPLICATED.

11
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:31,365
HEY, SERIOUS MCMOPEY,

12
00:00:31,865 --> 00:00:33,534
DO YOU KNOW HOW BORING
LIFE WOULD BE

13
00:00:33,617 --> 00:00:35,619
IF IT WERE SIMPLE.

14
00:00:36,787 --> 00:00:37,788
RIGHT?

15
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:41,291
HELLO?

16
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:43,669
ARE YOU THERE?

17
00:00:43,752 --> 00:00:44,795
I'M HERE, MOM.

18
00:00:45,462 --> 00:00:48,715
I'M JUST WORRIED
ABOUT EXAMS AND STUFF, OKAY.

19
00:00:48,799 --> 00:00:49,716
OKAY.

20
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:02,229
EMMA:
WHERE ARE WE GOING?

21
00:01:02,229 --> 00:01:03,438
PETER:
OH, JUST FOLLOW ME.

22
00:01:07,526 --> 00:01:08,610
I'M SORRY I CAN'T

IT'S SO...

32
00:01:34,595 --> 00:01:35,512
SEXY.

33
00:01:38,682 --> 00:01:40,559
WHO KNEW POTATO SALAD
WAS SUCH AN APHRODISIAC?

34
00:01:40,559 --> 00:01:41,977
SHUT UP!

35
00:01:44,188 --> 00:01:47,482

49
00:02:43,121 --> 00:02:46,500
IT WILL BE MOST FASCINATING,
I'M SURE.

50
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:47,960
ALL RIGHT, TAKE IT AWAY,
LIBERTY.

51
00:02:48,669 --> 00:02:51,421
LIBERTY:
OF COURSE, MR ELLIS.

52
00:02:51,505 --> 00:02:54,633
I'LL BEGIN WITH THE FEMALE
REPRODUCTIVE SYSTEM.

53
00:02:54,716 --> 00:02:56,635
AH, HINT HINT?

54
00:02:56,718 --> 00:03:00,556

YOU'RE FALLING ASLEEP
DURING CLASS.

59
00:03:11,441 --> 00:03:11,984
AND BY THE WAY,

60
00:03:12,067 --> 00:03:14,236
YOUR HANDS ARE COLDER
THAN MY NANA'S...

61
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:15,529
AT HER FUNERAL.

62
00:03:15,612 --> 00:03:18,115
I HAVE POOR CIRCULATION.

63
00:03:21,451 --> 00:03:23,745
(IRRITATED EXHALE)
WHY DID YOU DO THAT?

64
00:03:23,829 --> 00:03:26,206
BECAUSE YOU'VE BEEN WEIRD
AND DISTANT FOR WEEKS,

65
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:27,541
AND I'M GETTING TIRED
OF IT.

66
00:03:27,624 --> 00:03:28,709
WELL, I'M TIRED OF YOU

00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:35,757

71
00:03:35,841 --> 00:03:38,177
LIKE- (SIGHS) NOTHING.

72
00:03:38,844 --> 00:03:40,220
JUST DROP IT.

73
00:03:40,304 --> 00:03:42,097
WHOA. ARE YOU GETTING
YOUR ATTITUDE

74
00:03:42,181 --> 00:03:43,348
FROM THESE THINGS?

75
00:03:43,432 --> 00:03:45,934
PROTEIN BARS.
THEY'RE ALL YOU EAT, LATELY.

76
00:03:46,018 --> 00:03:47,269
ARE THEY EVEN SAFE?

77
00:03:47,352 --> 00:03:48,896
I GET THEM AT
A HEALTH FOOD STORE.

78
00:03:48,979 --> 00:03:51,064
MR. ELLIS:
MISS NELSON?

79
00:03:51,148 --> 00:03:53,066

00:04:02,743 --> 00:04:06,246
I'LL BE SEEING YOU

87
00:04:11,168 --> 00:04:12,711
(SCHOOL BELL RINGS)

88
00:04:12,794 --> 00:04:13,629
OH MY GOD.

89
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,965

EVER A GOOD IDEA

92
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:20,928
FOR MISS TELETUBBY,

93
00:04:21,011 --> 00:04:22,888
(CHUCKLES) ALEX,

94
00:04:22,971 --> 00:04:25,724
YOU'RE LIKE...
THE VINEGARY DRESSING

95
00:04:25,807 --> 00:04:28,727
ON THE DULL SALAD
OF MY LIFE.

96
00:04:30,187 --> 00:04:31,313
AND HEARING
THE WORD DULL,

97
00:04:31,396 --> 00:04:32,856
HAZEL MAGICALLY APPEARS.

98
00:04:35,776 --> 00:04:36,485
HI, HON.

99
00:04:36,568 --> 00:04:37,653
HEY, PAIGE.

100
00:04:37,736 --> 00:04:40,113
ANYTHING EXCITING
IN YOUR MAILBOX?

101
00:04:40,197 --> 00:04:41,490
IT'S VERY LONELY,

102
00:04:41,573 --> 00:04:44,785
FILLED ONLY WITH THE SOUND
OF MY INCREASING PANIC.

103
00:04:44,868 --> 00:04:46,453
ALEX:
GOSH, IF I DON'T GET
INTO THE UNIVERSITY

104
00:04:46,537 --> 00:04:49,873
OR SORORITY OF MY CHOICE,
I'LL JUST DIE.

105
00:04:51,208 --> 00:04:52,543
SEE YOU IN BIO.

106
00:04:52,626 --> 00:04:54,044
HOPE THE LESSON'S
ON BECOMING INTERESTING

107
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:54,962
ON THE CELLULAR LEVEL

108
00:04:55,045 --> 00:04:56,797
'CAUSE HAZEL
REALLY NEEDS IT.

109
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,007
EVERYTHING'S ALWAYS A GAME
TO YOU.

110
00:04:59,091 --> 00:05:00,342
KEEPS LIFE INTERESTING.

111
00:05:00,425 --> 00:05:03,720
WELL, SOME THINGS DO
ACTUALLY MATTER.

112
00:05:03,804 --> 00:05:05,806
SOME PEOPLE MATTER,

113
00:05:05,889 --> 00:05:07,432
AT LEAST TO ME.

114
00:05:07,516 --> 00:05:09,268
HAZEL'S ONE OF THEM
AND...

115
00:05:09,351 --> 00:05:11,687
YOU NEED TO BE
NICER TO HER.

116
00:05:15,899 --> 00:05:17,234
BETWEEN STUDYING
AND PLANNING

117
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:19,152
THE END OF THE YEAR
EXTRAVAGANZA,

118
00:05:19,236 --> 00:05:21,321
I BARELY HAVE TIME
TO BREATH.

119
00:05:21,405 --> 00:05:21,989
HOW 'BOUT YOU?

120
00:05:22,072 --> 00:05:23,657
HOW'S THE ENVIRONMENTAL CLUB?

121
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:25,200
MM, KINDA LOST INTEREST.

122
00:05:25,284 --> 00:05:25,701
WHAT?

123
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:27,327
YOU'RE TELLING ME
YOU DON'T CARE ABOUT

124
00:05:27,411 --> 00:05:29,204
THOSE POOR,
STARVING DOLPHINS

125
00:05:29,288 --> 00:05:30,497
IN THE RAIN FOREST?

126
00:05:30,581 --> 00:05:31,373
THEY'RE NOT STARVING,

127
00:05:31,456 --> 00:05:32,499
THEY'RE NOT IN
THE RAIN FOREST

128
00:05:32,583 --> 00:05:33,458
AND YES,
I STILL CARE.

129
00:05:33,542 --> 00:05:35,878
I'M JUST FOCUSED
ON OTHER STUFF.

130
00:05:35,961 --> 00:05:38,213
LIKE WHAT?
JOGGING?

131
00:05:38,297 --> 00:05:40,007
AND OTHER STUFF.

132
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:41,925
HEY, EMMA.
MANNY.

133
00:05:42,009 --> 00:05:42,509
THIS BRENDON,

134
00:05:42,593 --> 00:05:44,511
ONE OF THE KIDS
THAT I TUTOR.

135
00:05:44,595 --> 00:05:47,014
I'LL MEET YOU BACK HERE
AT 3:30 P.M.?

136
00:05:47,097 --> 00:05:48,932
I DIDN'T KNOW
YOU TUTORED.

137
00:05:49,016 --> 00:05:51,310
WELL, MY MOM ASKED
AND I THOUGHT WHY NOT?

138
00:05:51,393 --> 00:05:52,686
EVERYONE NEEDS
A HELPING HAND.

139
00:05:52,769 --> 00:05:54,813
HOW NICE OF YOU.

140
00:05:54,897 --> 00:05:57,191
SO, WHAT'S YOUR FAVOURITE
THING TO TEACH?

141
00:05:57,274 --> 00:05:58,317
GRAMMAR?

142
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,194
COMPOSITION?

143
00:06:00,277 --> 00:06:01,820
GETTING GIRLS DRUNK
AND FILMING THEM

144
00:06:01,904 --> 00:06:03,322
WITH THEIR TOPS OFF?

145
00:06:03,405 --> 00:06:04,823
THAT ONE'S NOT
IN THE CURRICULUM.

146
00:06:04,907 --> 00:06:06,617
DIDN'T THINK SO.

147
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:08,035
QUIT THE HERO ACT,
PETER.

148
00:06:08,118 --> 00:06:09,620
YOU'RE NOT FOOLING ANYONE.

149
00:06:09,703 --> 00:06:10,871
WE ALL KNOW
YOU'RE SCUM.

150
00:06:13,457 --> 00:06:14,208
EM,

151
00:06:14,917 --> 00:06:17,753
WE'RE GONNA BE LATE
FOR GYM.

152
00:06:24,843 --> 00:06:25,677
TOBY:
WE CAN'T JUST FILL
THE YEARBOOK

153
00:06:25,761 --> 00:06:27,721
WITH PICTURES OF YOU TWO,
YOU KNOW.

154
00:06:27,804 --> 00:06:30,724
YOU'VE GOT TO REPRESENT
THE WHOLE SCHOOL.

155
00:06:30,807 --> 00:06:32,935
PAIGE AND I
WERE THE SCHOOL.

156
00:06:33,018 --> 00:06:34,311
YEAH...

157
00:06:34,311 --> 00:06:35,979
THERE'S A CONVINCING
ARGUMENT.

158
00:06:45,656 --> 00:06:46,198
SORRY ALEX,

159
00:06:46,281 --> 00:06:47,574
YOU ACTUALLY HAVE
TO PARTICIPATE

160
00:06:47,658 --> 00:06:48,992
TO GET IN THE YEARBOOK.

161
00:06:49,076 --> 00:06:51,662
(FAKE SIGH) AND THE VICIOUS
INSULT CLUB, DOESN'T COUNT?

162
00:06:51,745 --> 00:06:53,664
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

163
00:06:54,289 --> 00:06:56,917
I THINK WE SHOULD
HANG OUT.

164
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,752
UH, THE SARCASM ASSOCIATION

165
00:06:58,836 --> 00:07:00,838
DOESN'T GET YOU
INTO THE YEARBOOK EITHER.

166
00:07:00,921 --> 00:07:02,798
WE DON'T HAVE TO BE
BEST FRIENDS...

167
00:07:02,881 --> 00:07:03,507
OR EVEN FRIENDS.

168
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:05,509
I'LL SETTLE FOR ACQUAINTANCES.

169
00:07:05,592 --> 00:07:08,053
ACQUAINTANCES WHO DON'T
KILL EACH OTHER.

170
00:07:08,136 --> 00:07:10,180
SO, WHAT DO YOU SAY?

171
00:07:11,306 --> 00:07:12,349
WHY DON'T WE ALL GO OUT,

172
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:14,268
GET LOADED,
AND GET INTO SOME TROUBLE?

173
00:07:14,351 --> 00:07:16,103
I COULD DO UP
SOME FAKE I.D.'S?

174
00:07:16,186 --> 00:07:18,105
TAKE YOU LADIES
ON A PUB CRAWL.

175
00:07:18,981 --> 00:07:20,148
NICE TRY.

176
00:07:20,232 --> 00:07:21,275
HAZEL:
OR...

177
00:07:21,358 --> 00:07:22,609
WE COULD GO SHOPPING -

178
00:07:22,693 --> 00:07:24,111
YOU, ME AND PAIGE -

179
00:07:24,194 --> 00:07:24,945
AT THE MALL?

180
00:07:25,028 --> 00:07:26,780
THERE'S A BIG SALE ON.

181
00:07:26,864 --> 00:07:27,906
YOU'RE REALLY GONNA MAKE ME
WORK FOR THIS,

182
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:29,074

184
00:07:37,583 --> 00:07:39,251
LET ME GUESS...

185
00:07:39,334 --> 00:07:40,836
YOU WENT TO VISIT
SHAQUILLE O'NEAL

186
00:07:40,919 --> 00:07:43,672
AND ALL YOU GOT
WAS HIS RUNNING SUIT.

187
00:07:43,755 --> 00:07:45,215
SHAQ IS GINORMOUS.

188
00:07:45,299 --> 00:07:47,634
UH, YEAH,
AND THAT'S THE JOKE.

189
00:07:47,718 --> 00:07:49,303
(WHISTLE BLOWS)

190
00:07:49,386 --> 00:07:50,262
'KAY GIRLS,

191
00:07:50,345 --> 00:07:53,932
WE'RE ROTATING STATIONS.

192
00:07:54,933 --> 00:07:57,603
DARCY:
EMMA, IT'S LIKE

193
00:07:57,686 --> 00:07:59,104
EMMA:
I'M KINDA COLD IS ALL.

194
00:07:59,188 --> 00:08:01,190
CHANTAY:
YOU'RE KINDA WHACKED IS ALL.

195
00:08:01,273 --> 00:08:03,108
OH NO! I THINK I SEE
AN EXTRA OUNCE

196
00:08:03,192 --> 00:08:04,860

197
00:08:04,943 --> 00:08:07,321
CALL WEIGHT WATCHERS!
911!

198
00:08:07,404 --> 00:08:09,489
YOU THINK IT'S FUN TO LAUGH
AT THE TUB OF LARD?

199
00:08:09,573 --> 00:08:10,365
IT'S NOT!

200
00:08:10,449 --> 00:08:11,074
I KNOW WHAT'S WRONG,

201
00:08:11,158 --> 00:08:14,328
SO YOU CAN STOP
POINTING IT OUT!

202
00:08:17,164 --> 00:08:19,041
YOU'RE SO NOT FAT, EMMA.

203
00:08:19,124 --> 00:08:21,001
WE WERE JUST JOKING.

204
00:08:21,084 --> 00:08:22,878
ARE YOU OKAY?

205
00:08:22,961 --> 00:08:24,671
OF COURSE.
I'M FINE.

206
00:08:24,755 --> 00:08:28,050
I JUST DON'T WANNA
BE HERE TODAY.

207
00:08:28,675 --> 00:08:30,010
ARMSTRONG:
EMMA?

208
00:08:41,939 --> 00:08:44,441
HAZEL:
I'M HAVING A FASHION
FLASH FORWARD.

209
00:08:44,525 --> 00:08:46,818
PAIGE:
CUTE. A SASSY MIX
OF CONSERVATIVE COLOUR

210
00:08:46,902 --> 00:08:48,195
AND EDGY MILITARY.

211
00:08:48,278 --> 00:08:51,240
IT'S GREY.
PAIGE HATES GREY.

212
00:08:51,323 --> 00:08:52,741
WHAT ABOUT... THIS?

213
00:08:56,119 --> 00:08:57,996
HAZEL:
NO OFFENSE,
BUT I DON'T THINK YOU'RE READY

214
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,289
FOR THE BIG LEAGUES.

215
00:08:59,373 --> 00:09:00,582
CAN YOU EVEN AFFORD
THOSE CLOTHES?

216
00:09:00,666 --> 00:09:01,708
HAZEL.

217
00:09:01,792 --> 00:09:02,334
I'M SORRY,

218
00:09:02,417 --> 00:09:06,046
BUT FASHION ISN'T EXACTLY
WHAT ALEX'S TYPE DOES WELL.

219
00:09:06,129 --> 00:09:08,173
(ANGRY HUFF)
MY "TYPE"?

220
00:09:08,257 --> 00:09:09,466
LESBIAN, YOU MEAN?

221
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:12,052
NO -
THE STYLE-IMPAIRED.

222
00:09:12,135 --> 00:09:14,429
LADIES, PLEASE, JUST CHILL.

223
00:09:15,347 --> 00:09:17,766
HAZEL, THIS SHRUNKEN BLAZER?

224
00:09:17,850 --> 00:09:19,393
IT SO HAS YOUR NAME ON IT.

225
00:09:19,476 --> 00:09:20,686
THINK IT MIGHT BE
A LITTLE TOO SHRUNKEN

226
00:09:20,769 --> 00:09:22,104
FOR HAZEL'S BODY TYPE.
GIMMIE.

227
00:09:23,647 --> 00:09:25,148
YOU IN A BLAZER?
SPARE ME.

228
00:09:26,275 --> 00:09:27,943
DO I DETECT JEALOUSY?

229
00:09:28,026 --> 00:09:30,279
TELL ME, HOW LONG HAVE YOU
WANTED TO KISS PAIGE?

230
00:09:30,362 --> 00:09:32,406
GROSS. THAT'S YOUR THING,
NOT MINE.

231
00:09:32,489 --> 00:09:35,075
GUYS, STOP IT!
YOU'RE EMBARRASSING ME.

232
00:09:35,158 --> 00:09:36,410
HAZEL:
AND BTW?

233
00:09:37,077 --> 00:09:39,121
PAIGE USED TO BE STRAIGHT
UNTIL YOU CAME ALONG

234
00:09:39,204 --> 00:09:40,581
AND TURNED HER GAY!

235
00:09:40,664 --> 00:09:41,874
(LAUGHING)
WHAT?!

236
00:09:41,957 --> 00:09:43,000
OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'M SORRY.

237
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:44,626
I'M THROUGH PLAYING NICE.

238
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:46,295
COULDN'T PULL IT OFF
FOR VERY LONG, HUH?

239
00:09:46,378 --> 00:09:47,462
BIG SURPRISE.

240
00:09:49,173 --> 00:09:51,425
(HANGERS CLANGING TOGETHER)

241
00:09:56,221 --> 00:09:56,930
SHE STARTED IT!

242
00:09:57,014 --> 00:09:58,098
NO, I DIDN'T!

243
00:09:59,057 --> 00:10:00,058
PAIGE!

244
00:10:01,185 --> 00:10:02,644
PAIGE.

245
00:10:05,689 --> 00:10:08,817
(LOW CHATTER)
(CRICKETS CHIRPING)

246
00:10:08,901 --> 00:10:09,902
EMMA:
GOING TOO FAST FOR YOU,
GRAMPS?

247
00:10:09,985 --> 00:10:10,569
I'LL SLOW DOWN

248
00:10:10,652 --> 00:10:12,196
SO YOU DON'T HAVE
TO TRAIL BEHIND.

249
00:10:12,279 --> 00:10:14,031
AW! BUT I LIKE TRAILING
BEHIND YOU.

250
00:10:14,114 --> 00:10:16,158
THAT WAY I GET TO
ENJOY THE VIEW.

251
00:10:16,241 --> 00:10:18,410
SORRY. SORRY. SORRY.

252
00:10:19,369 --> 00:10:21,288
AWE, YOUR JOGGING BREATH
IS FINE.

253
00:10:21,371 --> 00:10:23,540
NO. I MEAN THIS - US.

254
00:10:25,209 --> 00:10:25,626
JUST WHEN I THOUGHT

255
00:10:25,709 --> 00:10:27,544
WE WERE FINALLY
GETTING SOMEWHERE.

256
00:10:27,628 --> 00:10:28,670
I WANNA GO OUT WITH YOU,
PETER,

257
00:10:28,754 --> 00:10:30,172
I REALLY DO BUT-

258
00:10:30,255 --> 00:10:31,256
IT'S MANNY.

259
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:33,967
WEBMASTER OF THE "PETER STONE
MUST DIE" WEBSITE.

260
00:10:34,051 --> 00:10:35,802
WHY DOES SHE STILL
HATE ME SO MUCH?

261
00:10:35,886 --> 00:10:37,888
FORGIVENESS IS NOT
MANNY'S FORTE.

262
00:10:37,971 --> 00:10:39,348
BELIEVE ME, SHE'S LIKE
THE FIVE-TIME WINNER

263
00:10:39,431 --> 00:10:40,849
OF THE GOLDEN GRUDGE.

264
00:10:40,933 --> 00:10:42,267
WELL THEN...

265
00:10:43,018 --> 00:10:45,145
THEN WHY DOES SHE
HAVE TO KNOW?

266
00:10:45,229 --> 00:10:45,938
IT COULD BE
OUR LITTLE SECRET.

267
00:10:46,021 --> 00:10:47,814
NO,
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND!

268
00:10:47,898 --> 00:10:48,857
THIS IS ALL CONFUSING

269
00:10:48,941 --> 00:10:49,983
AND MESSY
AND COMPLICATED

270
00:10:50,067 --> 00:10:53,237
AND I CAN'T DO IT ANYMORE,
OKAY?

271
00:10:54,071 --> 00:10:55,405
SORRY.

272
00:10:55,489 --> 00:10:56,323
WELL, ME TOO.

273
00:10:56,406 --> 00:10:57,366
THIS SUCKS!

274
00:10:57,449 --> 00:10:58,992
YOU THINK YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE
THAT'S UNHAPPY?

275
00:10:59,076 --> 00:11:00,410
WELL, JOIN THE CLUB,
PETER!

276
00:11:00,494 --> 00:11:04,289
I'VE GOT A HUGE PILE OF WORRIES
OVER HERE BY MYSELF, OKAY?

277
00:11:05,749 --> 00:11:06,583
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

278
00:11:06,667 --> 00:11:06,917
NO!

279
00:11:08,752 --> 00:11:09,837
I HAVE TO GO.

280
00:11:18,554 --> 00:11:20,180
MANNY:
HERE. EAT THIS.

281
00:11:20,264 --> 00:11:22,558
EMMA:
I DON'T HAVE TIME FOR YOUR
"GIRL, INTERRUPTED" TODAY.

282
00:11:22,641 --> 00:11:24,518
I FOUND YOUR FOOD DIARY.

283
00:11:24,601 --> 00:11:25,853
YOU'RE NOT EATING.

284
00:11:25,936 --> 00:11:27,521
AND THOSE PROTEIN BARS,
THEY'RE PROPS.

285
00:11:27,604 --> 00:11:28,522
YOU'RE HIDING THEM.

286
00:11:28,605 --> 00:11:30,357
IT'S NOT TRUE.
YOU'RE MAKING IT UP.

287
00:11:31,775 --> 00:11:33,527
(READING)
"I HAVEN'T LOST WEIGHT
IN THREE DAYS.

288
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:35,863
I RUN TWICE AS MUCH
AND STILL NOTHING."

289
00:11:35,946 --> 00:11:36,697
STOP IT.

290
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:37,489
MANNY: (READING)
"I CAN'T EAT.

291
00:11:37,573 --> 00:11:38,866
MY BODY MAKES ME SICK.

292
00:11:38,949 --> 00:11:39,950
IT'S REBELLING AGAINST ME,

293
00:11:40,033 --> 00:11:41,368
JUST LIKE EVERYONE ELSE."

294
00:11:41,451 --> 00:11:42,286
GIVE THAT BACK!

295
00:11:42,369 --> 00:11:43,954
I BET SPIKE WOULD LOVE
TO READ THIS.

296
00:11:44,037 --> 00:11:45,038
EMMA:
MANNY! NO!

297
00:11:45,122 --> 00:11:47,040
I'M DATING PETER.

298
00:11:49,334 --> 00:11:49,960
WHAT?

299
00:11:50,043 --> 00:11:50,836
EMMA:
YOU HEARD ME.

300
00:11:50,919 --> 00:11:52,713
I'M DATING PETER.

301
00:11:52,796 --> 00:11:54,339
THAT'S WHY I'M LIKE THIS.

302
00:11:54,423 --> 00:11:55,549
I CAN'T EAT.
I CAN'T SLEEP.

303
00:11:55,632 --> 00:11:56,967
I'M STRESSED 24/7

304
00:11:57,050 --> 00:11:59,094
BECAUSE I'M SO SCARED
OF YOU FINDING OUT!

305
00:11:59,178 --> 00:12:00,387
NOW YOU KNOW.

306
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:02,514
TAKE YOUR STUPID DIARY.

307
00:12:02,598 --> 00:12:03,974
I DON'T CARE ANYMORE.

308
00:12:04,057 --> 00:12:07,561
YOU DO WHATEVER YOU WANT,
'CAUSE WE'RE THROUGH!

309
00:12:07,644 --> 00:12:08,395
I'M SLEEPING
ON THE COUCH

310
00:12:08,478 --> 00:12:10,480
AND TOMORROW, WE CAN TALK
ABOUT ME GOING HOME.

311
00:12:12,232 --> 00:12:12,649
FINE.

312
00:12:21,325 --> 00:12:23,702
GOT YOUR MESSAGES.
WHAT'S THE BIG NEWS?

313
00:12:23,785 --> 00:12:26,038
WHY DON'T I SHOW YOU.

314
00:12:26,622 --> 00:12:27,789
COME ON.

315
00:12:36,715 --> 00:12:39,051
I TOLD MANNY EVERYTHING.
WE'RE LEGIT.

316
00:12:39,134 --> 00:12:40,594
AND SHE'S OKAY WITH IT?

317
00:12:40,677 --> 00:12:43,305
WELL THAT'S SORT OF
THE PROBLEM.

318
00:12:43,388 --> 00:12:45,641
AND SPEAK OF THE DEVIL...

319
00:12:45,724 --> 00:12:48,268
WELL,
LOOK AT THE HAPPY COUPLE.

320
00:12:48,352 --> 00:12:50,103
MANNY, SAVE THE DRAMA
FOR YOUR NEXT AUDITION.

321
00:12:50,187 --> 00:12:51,396
WE'RE NOT INTERESTED.

322
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:51,897
MANNY:
FINE.

323
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:53,857
I JUST WANT WISH PETER
GOOD LUCK.

324
00:12:55,025 --> 00:12:56,068
THANKS, I GUESS.

325
00:12:56,151 --> 00:12:57,778
MANNY:
YOU'RE GONNA NEED IT.

326
00:12:57,861 --> 00:12:58,779
MAYBE YOU CAN KEEP TRACK

327
00:12:58,862 --> 00:13:01,240
OF WHETHER OR NOT
SHE'S EATING,

328
00:13:01,323 --> 00:13:02,658
'CAUSE I'M DONE.

329
00:13:05,077 --> 00:13:07,120
WHAT IS SHE
TALKING ABOUT?

330
00:13:07,204 --> 00:13:09,164
I DON'T KNOW, PETER.
SHE'S COMPLETELY CRAZY.

331
00:13:13,919 --> 00:13:15,796
COME ON, WE HAVE SOME FLAUNTING
TO DO.

332
00:13:23,637 --> 00:13:25,722
YOUR FAVOURITE.

333
00:13:25,806 --> 00:13:27,975
I WENT AND PICKED IT UP
AFTER SECURITY LET US GO.

334
00:13:28,058 --> 00:13:29,810
I'M NOT TALKING TO YOU.

335
00:13:29,893 --> 00:13:32,020
I HAD TO GO ALL THE WAY
TO MISSISSAUGA TO GET IT -

336
00:13:32,104 --> 00:13:32,813
ON TRANSIT.

337
00:13:32,896 --> 00:13:33,814
UH, HOW MUCH?

338
00:13:33,897 --> 00:13:34,523
CASHIER:
$2.16.

339
00:13:34,606 --> 00:13:36,149
I'M SORRY, OKAY?
BUT SHE PUSHED MY BUTTONS

340
00:13:36,233 --> 00:13:36,984
RIGHT IN.

341
00:13:37,067 --> 00:13:38,402
$2.20.

342
00:13:38,485 --> 00:13:39,528
CASHIER:
HERE'S YOUR CHANGE.

343
00:13:40,237 --> 00:13:41,029
I TRIED.

344
00:13:41,113 --> 00:13:42,322
THAT'S GOTTA COUNT
FOR SOMETHING.

345
00:13:42,406 --> 00:13:44,241
HAVE A GOOD DAY.
THANKS.

346
00:13:44,324 --> 00:13:45,868
I JUST CARE ABOUT YOU.

347
00:13:45,951 --> 00:13:48,245
GREAT JOB SHOWING IT.

348
00:13:59,006 --> 00:14:00,007
PETER:

349
00:14:00,090 --> 00:14:01,758
COMPLETELY OFFICIAL
FOR ALL THE WORLD TO SEE.

350
00:14:01,842 --> 00:14:02,926
YAY US.

351
00:14:07,097 --> 00:14:08,724

00:14:26,909 --> 00:14:29,870
WHOA.
THAT IS IMPRESSIVE.

354
00:14:29,953 --> 00:14:33,290
WHAT CAN I SAY,
I'M A HEALTHY, GROWING GIRL.

355
00:14:33,373 --> 00:14:34,833
PETER:
SOMETHING'S MISSING HERE.

356
00:14:34,917 --> 00:14:36,418
YOU'RE SO MYSTERIOUS.

357
00:14:36,502 --> 00:14:37,377
I JUST THOUGHT
WITH US COMING OUT

358
00:14:37,461 --> 00:14:38,837
THERE'D BE LIKE A
MARCHING BAND

359
00:14:38,921 --> 00:14:39,880
OR SOMETHING.

360
00:14:39,963 --> 00:14:43,300
MAYBE A BLIMP
WITH OUR NAME ON IT.

361
00:14:43,926 --> 00:14:45,886
HEY, NOT FEELING
SO HUGGABLE RIGHT NOW.

362
00:14:48,889 --> 00:14:51,225
EMMA, YOU'VE GOT FRIES
IN YOUR POCKET.

363
00:14:51,308 --> 00:14:53,185
IT'S JUST A LITTLE SNACK
FOR LATER.

364
00:14:53,268 --> 00:14:56,271
COLD FRENCH FRIES
FROM YOUR POCKET?

365
00:14:56,355 --> 00:14:57,814
THAT'S A LITTLE WEIRD.

366
00:14:57,898 --> 00:14:58,398
NOT REALLY.

367
00:14:58,482 --> 00:15:02,486
HAVEN'T YOU SEEN
"NAPOLEON DYNAMITE"?

368
00:15:02,569 --> 00:15:03,529
COME ON.

369
00:15:03,612 --> 00:15:06,615
I'M JUST LIKE
A LITTLE SQUIRREL.

370
00:15:06,698 --> 00:15:09,451
SURE.
I GOTTA GET TO CLASS.

371
00:15:11,036 --> 00:15:11,662
SEE YA.

372
00:15:14,873 --> 00:15:16,375
PAIGE ISN'T TALKING
TO ME.

373
00:15:16,458 --> 00:15:17,292
ME NEITHER.

374
00:15:17,376 --> 00:15:19,753
WELL, I HAPPEN TO BE
UPSET ABOUT IT.

375
00:15:19,837 --> 00:15:20,420
SO DO I.

376
00:15:20,504 --> 00:15:22,965
I DO HAVE FEELINGS,
YOU KNOW.

377
00:15:23,048 --> 00:15:24,424
AND WHEN PAIGE
GETS UPSET-

378
00:15:24,508 --> 00:15:25,759
TELL ME ABOUT IT.
SHE'S THE STUBBORNEST PERSON

379
00:15:25,843 --> 00:15:26,552
I EVER KNEW.

380
00:15:26,635 --> 00:15:27,594
OH, ME TOO!

381
00:15:27,678 --> 00:15:28,595
AND IF YOU REALLY
WANT TO KNOW

382
00:15:28,679 --> 00:15:29,763
HOW BAD A FREEZE-OUT
CAN GET?

383
00:15:29,847 --> 00:15:32,432
PHONE ASHLEY KERWIN UP.

384
00:15:32,516 --> 00:15:34,309
WE COULD TRY PLAYING
NICE, AGAIN.

385
00:15:34,393 --> 00:15:35,477
"AGAIN?"

386
00:15:35,561 --> 00:15:38,438
WE COULD TRY PLAYING NICE
PERIOD.

387
00:15:38,522 --> 00:15:40,023
IF WE GO FOR HOT BEVERAGES,

388
00:15:40,107 --> 00:15:42,109
PROMISE NOT TO SCALD ME?

389
00:15:42,192 --> 00:15:42,943
JUST AS LONG
AS YOU PROMISE

390
00:15:43,026 --> 00:15:45,779
TO LEAVE YOUR CYANIDE
AT HOME.

391
00:15:48,198 --> 00:15:49,199
(BELL RINGS)

392
00:15:49,616 --> 00:15:51,410
MANNY:
SO, YOU ALL HAVE YOUR SCHEDULES?

393
00:15:51,493 --> 00:15:53,370
NEXT MEETING'S TUESDAY.

394
00:16:01,378 --> 00:16:02,462
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

395
00:16:02,546 --> 00:16:03,755
TO SHOW YOU SOMETHING.

396
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:04,590
GOOD FOR YOU, PETER.

397
00:16:04,673 --> 00:16:07,634
LEARNING TO READ
IS VERY IMPORTANT.

398
00:16:07,718 --> 00:16:10,095
HIDING FOOD, BAGGY CLOTHES,

399
00:16:10,179 --> 00:16:11,972
MOOD SWINGS, PARANOIA.

400
00:16:12,055 --> 00:16:16,101
THOSE ARE ALL POSSIBLE SYMPTOMS
OF ANOREXIA-NERVOSA.

401
00:16:16,185 --> 00:16:17,144
I'LL TALK TO HER MOM.

402
00:16:17,227 --> 00:16:19,229
NO, WE'LL TALK
TO HER MOM.

403
00:16:19,313 --> 00:16:20,480
HATE ME ALL YOU WANT,

404
00:16:20,564 --> 00:16:22,149
EMMA'S MY GIRLFRIEND.

405
00:16:22,232 --> 00:16:24,818
YOU CAN'T STOP ME
FROM HELPING HER.

406
00:16:24,902 --> 00:16:26,612
DON'T EVEN TRY.

407
00:16:37,706 --> 00:16:38,415
SO...

408
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:40,751
SO...

409
00:16:43,128 --> 00:16:45,547
(CLEARS THROAT UNCOMFORTABLY)

410
00:16:46,757 --> 00:16:48,008
WHAT IS THIS?

411
00:16:48,091 --> 00:16:49,301
PAIGE-LIKERS CLUB.

412
00:16:49,384 --> 00:16:51,178
ALEX IS TRYING
TO GET INTO THE YEARBOOK.

413
00:16:51,261 --> 00:16:53,180
AND THE FIGHTING
BEGINS WHEN?

414
00:16:53,263 --> 00:16:54,723
WE'VE SIGNED
A PEACE TREATY.

415
00:16:54,806 --> 00:16:57,100
WE ALSO BOUGHT YOU
A TREAT.

416
00:16:57,184 --> 00:17:00,437
WE EVEN WENT DUTCH
TO PAY FOR IT.

417
00:17:02,356 --> 00:17:03,482
SO YOU KNOW,

418
00:17:03,565 --> 00:17:05,609
YOU GUYS MADE ME REALLY MAD.

419
00:17:05,692 --> 00:17:07,694
AND I REFUSE TO BE
THE MONKEY IN THE MIDDLE.

420
00:17:07,778 --> 00:17:08,695
ALEX:
THAT'S FINE.

421
00:17:08,779 --> 00:17:09,738
AS LONG AS YOU'RE
A TALKING MONKEY,

422
00:17:09,821 --> 00:17:12,032
'CAUSE WE'RE A LITTLE STUCK
FOR CONVERSATION.

423
00:17:12,115 --> 00:17:13,242

00:17:13,325 --> 00:17:15,494
LET'S AH, START WITH
HOW MANY CALORIES

425
00:17:15,577 --> 00:17:16,703

426
00:17:16,787 --> 00:17:18,163
I ALWAYS ORDER NO WHIP.

427
00:17:18,247 --> 00:17:19,331
TOLD YOU SO, ALEX.

428
00:17:19,414 --> 00:17:20,374
PAIGE DOESN'T EAT SWEETS.

429
00:17:20,457 --> 00:17:21,333
THAT'S A LIE.

430
00:17:21,416 --> 00:17:21,834
SHUT UP!

431
00:17:21,917 --> 00:17:23,544
YOU HAD THREE PIECES

432
00:17:23,627 --> 00:17:24,878
LAST WEEKEND!

433
00:17:24,962 --> 00:17:27,089
IT WAS OUR TWO MONTH
ANNIVERSARY!

434

435
00:17:28,632 --> 00:17:30,551

(GIGGLING AND LAUGHING)

441
00:17:53,907 --> 00:17:54,616

SPIKE:
COME SIT DOWN HERE, HONEY.

443
00:17:58,161 --> 00:17:59,288
MANNY AND PETER
CAME HERE

444
00:17:59,371 --> 00:18:02,082
BECAUSE THEY'RE WORRIED
ABOUT YOU.

445
00:18:02,165 --> 00:18:03,584
SIMPSON:
AND IT'S NOT JUST THEM.

446
00:18:03,667 --> 00:18:05,043
YOUR TEACHERS TOLD ME
YOU'RE HAVING TROUBLE AT SCHOOL.

447
00:18:06,170 --> 00:18:07,504
THEY'RE LYING.

448
00:18:07,588 --> 00:18:09,423
NO, THEY'RE NOT.
EMMA...

449
00:18:10,090 --> 00:18:12,718
WE WANT YOU TO GO
TALK TO SOMEONE -

450
00:18:12,801 --> 00:18:15,262
A THERAPIST -
ABOUT WHY YOU'RE NOT EATING.

451
00:18:15,345 --> 00:18:16,430
I AM EATING.

452
00:18:16,513 --> 00:18:18,348
THERE'S NOTHING WRONG!

453
00:18:18,432 --> 00:18:19,808
YOU'RE HIDING FOOD.

454
00:18:19,892 --> 00:18:22,227
YOU'VE GOT MAJOR
PSYCHO MOOD SWINGS.

455

YOU'RE JUST NOT YOU.

456
00:18:23,770 --> 00:18:25,689
WE'RE WORRIED.

457
00:18:25,772 --> 00:18:28,775
(TEARING UP)
YOU GUYS ALL SO PERFECT.

458
00:18:28,859 --> 00:18:30,319
YOU TAKE ADVANTAGE
OF DRUNK GIRLS.

459
00:18:30,402 --> 00:18:31,862
YOU ARE THE DRUNK GIRL.

460
00:18:31,945 --> 00:18:32,654
AND LAST TIME I CHECKED,

461
00:18:32,738 --> 00:18:34,740
YOU WERE MAKING OUT
WITH HIS MOTHER.

462
00:18:34,823 --> 00:18:36,491
EMMA,
YOU NEED TO CALM DOWN.

463
00:18:36,575 --> 00:18:38,035
NO, I NEED TO
GET OUT OF HERE.

YOU CAN'T GO, EMMA.
PLEASE.

465
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:44,708
WE NEED TO GET YOU HELP.

466
00:18:44,791 --> 00:18:46,084
YOU DID THIS!
YOU TOLD THEM!

467
00:18:46,168 --> 00:18:47,920
THIS IS ALL YOUR FAULT,

I SHOULDN'T HAVE DIVED
OVER THE COUNTER

489
00:19:58,031 --> 00:20:00,826
FOR THAT WHIPPED CREAM

THOSE GERMAN TOURISTS

I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU
THINK THIS IS FUNNY.

(MONITOR BEEPS)

501
00:20:32,107 --> 00:20:35,027
SPIKE:
THE DOCTOR SAID
YOU HAD A PANIC ATTACK.

502
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:37,112
EMMA:
'KAY, SO I'M FINE.

503
00:20:37,696 --> 00:20:38,238
MUST'VE BEEN A REACTION

504
00:20:38,322 --> 00:20:39,531
TO ONE OF THOSE
PROTEIN BARS.

BUT IT WAS JUST
A PANIC ATTACK.

510
00:20:46,455 --> 00:20:49,082
BROUGHT ON BY STARVATION.

511
00:20:53,795 --> 00:20:57,007
A PSYCHIATRIST IS COMING
TO TALK TO YOU.

512
00:20:57,090 --> 00:20:59,843
AND SHE MIGHT
DIAGNOSE YOU...

513
00:20:59,927 --> 00:21:01,428
AS ANOREXIC.

514
00:21:03,263 --> 00:21:04,598

EM, YOU HAVE TO STOP.

518
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:14,733
YOU HAVE TO STOP

519
00:21:14,816 --> 00:21:17,152
OR YOU'RE GONNA DIE.

520
00:21:17,236 --> 00:21:19,112
YOU CAN'T DO THAT TO ME.

521
00:21:19,196 --> 00:21:21,281
NO ONE'S GONNA DIE,
OKAY?

522
00:21:22,199 --> 00:21:23,158
OKAY.

523
00:21:23,992 --> 00:21:26,578
