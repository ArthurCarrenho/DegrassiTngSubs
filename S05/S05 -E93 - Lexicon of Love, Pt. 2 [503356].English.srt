1
00:00:08,258 --> 00:00:09,134
(SIGHING)

2
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:18,018
WHO'S THE EVIL GENIUS

3
00:00:18,101 --> 00:00:20,145
WHO MADE MORNING
SO FRIGGING BRIGHT?

4
00:00:20,229 --> 00:00:22,356
PAIGE:
OH, PROBABLY THE SAME
EVIL GENIUS

5
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:24,358
WHO DECIDED THAT THERE
SHOULD BE SCHOOL DAYS

6
00:00:24,441 --> 00:00:26,902
AFTER CRAZY
MOVIE PREMIERES.

7
00:00:26,985 --> 00:00:28,195
ALEX:
CRAZY?

8
00:00:28,278 --> 00:00:29,029
IS THAT THE VERB
YOU'RE GONNA USE

9
00:00:29,112 --> 00:00:30,364
TO DESCRIBE LAST NIGHT?

10
00:00:30,447 --> 00:00:31,281
ADJECTIVE.

11
00:00:31,949 --> 00:00:35,661
AND CONSIDERING I VOLUNTARILY
SLEPT ON THE DOWNSTAIRS COUCH,

12
00:00:35,744 --> 00:00:37,204
CRAZY SEEMS ABOUT RIGHT.

13
00:00:37,287 --> 00:00:39,081
YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO SLEEP
ON THE COUCH.

14
00:00:39,164 --> 00:00:40,624
YOU WOULD'VE BEEN SAFE
IN THE ROOM WITH ME.

15
00:00:41,917 --> 00:00:42,960
WE'RE GONNA BE LATE,

16
00:00:43,043 --> 00:00:44,419
AND I HATE BEING LATE.

17
00:00:44,503 --> 00:00:46,713
SO YOU SHOULD UH...
YOU SHOULD GET READY.

18
00:00:46,797 --> 00:00:49,383
NOW IF I COULD JUST
FIND MY BUS PASS

19
00:00:49,466 --> 00:00:51,552
THAT WOULD BE
ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANT.

20
00:00:51,635 --> 00:00:52,386
PAIGE?

21
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:53,345
PAIGE:
YOU KNOW,
THE BUS PEOPLE

22
00:00:53,428 --> 00:00:56,473
SHOULD REALLY JUST...
JUST GIVE A-A-AN IMPLANT

23
00:00:56,557 --> 00:00:57,975
OR A... OR A TATTOO,

24
00:00:58,058 --> 00:00:58,892
AND I COULD SAVE-

25
00:00:58,976 --> 00:00:59,476
PAIGE!

26
00:01:02,271 --> 00:01:05,232
HEY, I'M ALEX,

27
00:01:05,315 --> 00:01:06,149
YOUR FRIEND?

28
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:11,238
CAN YOU JUST TALK TO ME?

29
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:15,492
I CAN'T EVEN BEGIN
TO PROCESS

30
00:01:16,201 --> 00:01:18,287
WHAT HAPPENED LAST NIGHT.

31
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:21,748
NOT WITH OUR LITTLE
SISTER-ACT-SLUT-DANCE

32
00:01:21,832 --> 00:01:25,127
OR... THE DRAMA WITH
YOUR MOM'S BOYFRIEND.

33
00:01:26,795 --> 00:01:28,088
YOU CALL THAT DRAMA?

34
00:01:28,172 --> 00:01:29,423
I CALL THAT REALITY TV.

35
00:01:29,506 --> 00:01:30,757
PAIGE:
THAT'S NOT FUNNY.

36
00:01:30,841 --> 00:01:32,384
THIS IS NOT FUNNY.

37
00:01:32,467 --> 00:01:35,137
THERE IS A GIRL IN MY BED,
ALEX.

38
00:01:35,721 --> 00:01:36,597
YOU.

39
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:40,225
IT'S LIKE I WOKE UP IN SOME
WEIRD MOVIE WITH SUBTITLES -

40
00:01:40,309 --> 00:01:41,518
THE KIND OF MOVIE
THAT I HATE -

41
00:01:41,602 --> 00:01:44,188
AND I CAN'T DEAL WITH IT,
OKAY?

42
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:46,190
I CAN'T DEAL WITH YOU.

43
00:01:53,197 --> 00:01:54,031
ALL RIGHT,

44
00:01:54,948 --> 00:01:58,869
I'M JUST GONNA GO RUB
SOME TOOTHPASTE ON MY TEETH,

45
00:01:58,952 --> 00:02:01,121
AND THEN YOU CAN WALK
20 PACES AHEAD OF ME

46
00:02:01,205 --> 00:02:03,540
ALL THE WAY
TO THE BUS STOP.

HAZEL:
HEY, WHAT HAPPENED
TO YOU LAST NIGHT?

60
00:02:58,220 --> 00:02:59,680
YOU AND ALEX WENT
IN THE VIP PARTY

61
00:02:59,763 --> 00:03:00,514
AND - POOF! -

62
00:03:00,597 --> 00:03:02,432
YOU NEVER CAME
BACK OUT.

63
00:03:02,516 --> 00:03:03,559
UM, I'M NOT QUITE SURE

64
00:03:03,642 --> 00:03:06,144
HOW TO DESCRIBE
WHAT HAPPENED...

65
00:03:06,228 --> 00:03:07,396
EXACTLY.

66
00:03:08,105 --> 00:03:09,398
WHY?

67
00:03:09,481 --> 00:03:10,691
DID YOU MEET
SOMEBODY?

68
00:03:11,525 --> 00:03:13,610
YOU DID?!
IS HE FAMOUS?

69
00:03:13,694 --> 00:03:15,571
WOULD I KNOW
WHO HE IS?

70
00:03:15,654 --> 00:03:17,364
FAMOUS? NO.

71
00:03:17,447 --> 00:03:20,450
BUT UM... YOU MIGHT
KNOW WHO... HE IS.

72
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:23,745
SORRY TO INTERRUPT.

73
00:03:23,829 --> 00:03:24,872
THE ASSEMBLY'S
AT 4:00 P.M.,

74
00:03:24,955 --> 00:03:25,789
SO WE SHOULD REALLY
START REHEARSING

75
00:03:25,873 --> 00:03:26,748
THAT NEW CHEER.

76
00:03:28,834 --> 00:03:30,043
YOU KNOW, THE BIG

77
00:03:30,127 --> 00:03:32,296
"THANK YOU KEVIN SMITH"
ASSEMBLY;

78
00:03:32,713 --> 00:03:35,424
THE ONE THAT YOU'VE WRITTEN
THE NEW CHEER FOR.

79
00:03:35,507 --> 00:03:37,467
YOU HAVE WRITTEN IT,
RIGHT?

80
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,053
SURE, HON.

81
00:03:40,137 --> 00:03:42,014
UM, I'VE GOT IT ALL
WORKED OUT IN MY HEAD.

82
00:03:42,097 --> 00:03:44,808
SO LET'S MEET BACK
HERE AT NOON

83
00:03:44,892 --> 00:03:47,769
AND I WILL HAVE
THE MOST BRILLIANTISH CHEER

84
00:03:47,853 --> 00:03:50,189
TYPED UP AND READY
FOR REHEARSING.

85
00:03:50,272 --> 00:03:51,773
OKAY, GREAT!

86
00:03:57,154 --> 00:03:58,113
WHEN YOU ASKED
FOR A RIDE,

87
00:03:58,197 --> 00:04:02,242
I THOUGHT YOU HAD
SOMETHING TO TELL ME.

88
00:04:02,326 --> 00:04:04,745
(MOTORBIKE APPROACHING)

89
00:04:07,831 --> 00:04:10,709
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU LET HIM
KEEP THAT STUPID MOTORBIKE.

90
00:04:10,792 --> 00:04:12,085
AW, IT'S HARMLESS...

91
00:04:12,169 --> 00:04:14,171
IN A MID-LIFE CRISIS
SORT OF WAY.

92
00:04:17,299 --> 00:04:18,217
HE LOOKS HAPPY.

93
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:19,259
EMMA:
MOM, BE HONEST,

94
00:04:19,343 --> 00:04:20,969
HE LOOKS STUPID.

95
00:04:21,053 --> 00:04:22,596
THAT BIKE WAS SUCH
A MISTAKE.

96
00:04:22,679 --> 00:04:25,098
SOMETIMES YOU HAVE TO LET
PEOPLE MAKE MISTAKES.

97
00:04:25,182 --> 00:04:26,517
THAT'S WHAT LOVE'S
ALL ABOUT.

98
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:37,778
EMMA?

99
00:04:37,861 --> 00:04:39,112
EMMA, I KNOW YOU
HATE ME RIGHT NOW -

100
00:04:39,196 --> 00:04:40,405
NOT THAT I DON'T
DESERVE IT, BUT-

101
00:04:40,489 --> 00:04:41,782
FOR HAVING AN AFFAIR
WITH THE PRINCIPAL?

102
00:04:41,865 --> 00:04:42,699
I THINK YOU DESERVE

103
00:04:42,783 --> 00:04:44,034
JUST A DROP
OF ANGER FOR THAT.

104
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:46,036
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

105
00:04:46,703 --> 00:04:47,663
IT'S NOT AN AFFAIR,
ALL RIGHT?

106
00:04:47,746 --> 00:04:49,414
IT STOPPED AT KISSING.

107
00:04:49,498 --> 00:04:51,959
AND I PROMISE IT'LL NEVER,
EVER HAPPEN AGAIN.

108
00:04:52,042 --> 00:04:54,461
I HAVE TO GET TO CLASS.

109
00:04:56,004 --> 00:04:57,381
SPIKE:
(HONKING THE HORN)
BYE, GUYS.

110
00:05:02,553 --> 00:05:04,221
HATZILAKOS:
HOW'RE YOU DOING TODAY?
GOOD.

111
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:05,264
MORNING, EMMA.

112
00:05:05,347 --> 00:05:06,181
DON'T TALK TO ME.

113
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:24,575
HEY.

114
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:28,620
CAN I ASK YOU
A TEENSY QUESTION?

115
00:05:31,915 --> 00:05:33,542
DO YOU EVER
THINK ABOUT GIRLS?

116
00:05:33,625 --> 00:05:35,836
UH... INTERESTING
QUESTION

117
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:37,671
FIRST THING
IN THE MORNING.

118
00:05:37,754 --> 00:05:40,048
NOW, DID YOU MISS THE YEARS
THAT I DATED YOUR BROTHER?

119
00:05:40,132 --> 00:05:41,341
BUT JUST BECAUSE
YOU'RE GAY,

120
00:05:41,425 --> 00:05:42,259
THAT DOESN'T MEAN

121
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:44,344
YOU CAN'T THINK
ABOUT GIRLS

122
00:05:44,428 --> 00:05:46,763
EVERY NOW AND THEN,
RIGHT?

123
00:05:46,847 --> 00:05:48,557
ARE YOU TRYING TO HOOK ME UP
WITH SOMEONE?

124
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:49,308
OH WICKED.
DOES THAT MEAN

125
00:05:49,391 --> 00:05:50,684
THERE'S A GIRL OUT THERE
WHO LIKES ME?

126
00:05:50,767 --> 00:05:51,852
NO.

127
00:05:51,935 --> 00:05:54,938
THE OBJECT OF FEMALE
AFFECTION'S...

128
00:05:55,022 --> 00:05:56,565
PRETTY MUCH ME.

129
00:05:56,648 --> 00:05:57,691
YOU?

130
00:05:57,774 --> 00:05:59,443
OH, I KNEW IT!

131
00:06:00,235 --> 00:06:01,278
IT'S HEATHER SINCLAIR.

132
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:02,571
PAIGE, I'VE SEEN THE WAY
SHE LOOKS AT YOU-

133
00:06:02,654 --> 00:06:04,114
EW! DOUBLE EW!

134
00:06:04,198 --> 00:06:07,201
NO, IT'S...
IT'S NOT HEATHER SINCLAIR.

135
00:06:08,327 --> 00:06:09,286
ALEX.

136
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:09,703
HEY.

137
00:06:10,329 --> 00:06:11,747
PAIGE:
HI.

138
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:13,665
HEY,
PULL UP A CHAIR.

139
00:06:14,458 --> 00:06:16,168
HEY, YOU TWO STILL NEED
TO TELL ME ABOUT

140
00:06:16,251 --> 00:06:18,295
THAT VIP PARTY
LAST NIGHT.

141
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:21,006
ALEX:
I THINK I'M GONNA SIT
OVER HERE TODAY.

142
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:23,675
WHOA.

143
00:06:25,969 --> 00:06:26,386
WHOA.

144
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:30,265
PAIGE, IT'S-IT'S ALEX?

145
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:36,438
SHE KISSED ME
LAST NIGHT.

146
00:06:37,147 --> 00:06:38,774
(SCHOOL BELL RINGS)

147
00:06:39,691 --> 00:06:42,194
SIMPSON:
MORNING, CLASS.

148
00:06:42,861 --> 00:06:45,572
AS YOU KNOW, KEVIN SMITH
WILL BE VISITING US TODAY.

149
00:06:45,656 --> 00:06:47,282
I WANT YOU TO TAKE ADVANTAGE
OF HIM BEING HERE

150
00:06:47,366 --> 00:06:49,368
AND PREPARE SOME SMART
MEDIA QUESTIONS FOR HIM.

151
00:07:26,572 --> 00:07:29,449
WAITING FOR SOMEONE?

152
00:07:29,533 --> 00:07:30,242
OH LOOK,

153
00:07:30,325 --> 00:07:31,743
HERE I AM IN AN ALLEY
AND A RAT APPEARS

154
00:07:31,827 --> 00:07:32,786
JUST LIKE MAGIC.

155
00:07:37,916 --> 00:07:41,420
I FOUND THESE UNDER THE TABLE
AT THE CLUB.

156
00:07:42,004 --> 00:07:43,463
I THOUGHT MAYBE YOUR NEW
BESTEST GIRLFRIEND

157
00:07:43,547 --> 00:07:44,756
MIGHT WANT THEM BACK.

158
00:07:47,885 --> 00:07:49,636
JUST GIVE ME THE SHOES
AND GO AWAY.

159
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:50,304
FIRST I WANT YOU
TO TELL ME

160
00:07:50,387 --> 00:07:51,180
WHAT IT IS YOU THINK

161
00:07:51,263 --> 00:07:52,639
YOU COULD POSSIBLY
HAVE IN COMMON

162
00:07:52,723 --> 00:07:54,474
WITH A STUCK-UP
CHEERLEADER.

163
00:07:54,558 --> 00:07:57,394
PAIGE:
SORRY I TOOK SO LONG!

164
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:06,695
I SEEM TO HAVE INTERRUPTED
FUN TIME WITH JAY,

165
00:08:06,778 --> 00:08:08,238
WHICH LOOKED
KIND OF HOT.

166
00:08:08,322 --> 00:08:10,699
NOT. IN FACT,
IT'S BEEN CANCELLED.

167
00:08:10,782 --> 00:08:13,952
REPLACED BY
FUN TIME WITH PAIGE.

168
00:08:16,914 --> 00:08:19,291
PAIGE:
ALEX? WE NEED TO TALK.

169
00:08:22,461 --> 00:08:24,463
THIS CAN'T HAPPEN.

170
00:08:25,422 --> 00:08:27,716
I'M NOT A...
A LESBIAN.

171
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:31,845
AND YOU THINK I AM?

172
00:08:31,929 --> 00:08:33,680
WELL, YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO KISSED ME.

173
00:08:33,764 --> 00:08:35,557
WHAT ARE YOU, FIVE?

174
00:08:35,641 --> 00:08:37,226
AND FOR THE RECORD,

175
00:08:37,309 --> 00:08:39,394
YOU KISSED ME BACK.

176
00:08:40,103 --> 00:08:43,023
I'M NOT EVEN SUPPOSED
TO LIKE PEOPLE LIKE YOU.

177
00:08:43,106 --> 00:08:46,151
PEOPLE WHO WEAR BLACK
WITH NAVY

178
00:08:47,778 --> 00:08:49,363
AND WHO HATE
EVERYTHING...

179
00:08:49,446 --> 00:08:51,031
AND EVERYONE.

180
00:08:53,367 --> 00:08:55,285
I DON'T HATE YOU.

181
00:08:56,286 --> 00:08:58,247
EVEN IF YOU ARE ONE
OF THE POPULAR IDIOTS

182
00:08:58,330 --> 00:09:00,123
WHO DRINKS LATTES

183
00:09:00,207 --> 00:09:02,251
AND READS
STUPID MAGAZINES

184
00:09:02,334 --> 00:09:04,837
AND LAUGHS
WAY TOO LOUD.

185
00:09:06,964 --> 00:09:10,467
I HAVE TO LAUGH
WHEN I'M AROUND YOU.

186
00:09:10,968 --> 00:09:13,387
I CAN'T REALLY HELP IT.

187
00:09:14,847 --> 00:09:18,308
AND I HAVE TO BE BETTER
WHEN I'M AROUND YOU.

188
00:09:18,392 --> 00:09:20,811
I CAN'T HELP IT
EITHER.

189
00:09:35,158 --> 00:09:37,369
JAY:
NEED A COUPLE OF HANDS
FOR YOUR POMS?

190
00:09:37,452 --> 00:09:39,037
HAZEL:
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

191
00:09:39,121 --> 00:09:41,081
JAY:
WORLD PEACE,
A SALAMI SUB,

192
00:09:41,164 --> 00:09:42,875
AND A CHANCE TO TALK
TO MY GOOD FRIEND, HAZEY.

193
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:44,459
WE'RE NOT FRIENDS.

194
00:09:44,543 --> 00:09:47,504
SO YOU DON'T WANNA
HEAR MY NEWS THEN.

195
00:09:47,588 --> 00:09:50,507
THAT PAIGE HAS GONE
THE GAY-WAY.

196
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:51,383
EXCUSE ME?

197
00:09:51,466 --> 00:09:52,759
JAY:
YOU HEARD ME.

198
00:09:52,843 --> 00:09:55,387
YEAH, I SAW YOUR FRIEND
AND MY EX

199
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:58,348
DOING SOME SERIOUSLY
SEXY DANCING LAST NIGHT.

200
00:09:58,432 --> 00:10:00,225
SO? YOU NEED
TO GET OUT MORE.

201
00:10:00,309 --> 00:10:01,685
GIRLS DO THAT STUFF
ALL THE TIME.

202
00:10:01,768 --> 00:10:02,644
JAY:
AND I JUST SAW PAIGE

203
00:10:02,728 --> 00:10:04,605
LAY A BIG OL' SMOOCH
ON ALEX.

204
00:10:04,688 --> 00:10:05,856
YOU'RE TRYING TO TELL ME
THAT'S SOMETHING

205
00:10:05,939 --> 00:10:07,316
THAT GIRLS DO
ALL THE TIME?

206
00:10:07,399 --> 00:10:09,484
I'M NOT GETTING
INVOLVED IN THIS.

207
00:10:10,777 --> 00:10:11,361
LISTEN,

208
00:10:12,029 --> 00:10:13,572
DO YOU REALLY THINK
THAT PAIGE WANTS TO END

209
00:10:13,655 --> 00:10:15,741
HER DISTINGUISHED
HIGH SCHOOL CAREER

210
00:10:15,824 --> 00:10:17,201
AS THE SCHOOL LESBO?

211
00:10:17,284 --> 00:10:18,285
YOU'RE BEING
DISGUSTING.

212
00:10:18,368 --> 00:10:19,369
I'M BEING HONEST.

213
00:10:19,453 --> 00:10:21,455
AND WHAT ABOUT YOU,
HUH?

214
00:10:21,538 --> 00:10:23,415
ARE YOU LOOKING FORWARD
TO THOSE INEVITABLE RUMOURS

215
00:10:23,498 --> 00:10:25,042
ABOUT YOU AND PAIGE?

216
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:27,211
IS THAT HOW YOU
WANNA BE REMEMBERED?

217
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:33,133
HAZEL:
PAIGE, I NEED TO SPEAK TO YOU.

218
00:10:33,217 --> 00:10:34,635
KINDA BUSY RIGHT NOW.

219
00:10:34,718 --> 00:10:36,178
I'LL BET YOU'LL BE EVEN
BUSIER LATER...

220
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:37,971
WITH HER.

221
00:10:40,641 --> 00:10:41,141
PAIGE...

222
00:10:42,267 --> 00:10:43,352
I'VE GOT YOU.

223
00:10:44,186 --> 00:10:45,145
WHAT'RE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

224
00:10:45,229 --> 00:10:46,480
I'M TALKING ABOUT ALEX.

225
00:10:46,563 --> 00:10:47,439
WHAT IS SHE DOING HERE?

226
00:10:47,523 --> 00:10:50,150
IS SHE LIKE
YOUR GIRLFRIEND NOW?

227
00:10:50,234 --> 00:10:50,567
OOF!

228
00:10:52,402 --> 00:10:54,238
DON'T WORRY,
I'M FINE.

229
00:11:02,287 --> 00:11:03,080
WHO TOLD YOU?

230
00:11:03,163 --> 00:11:03,789
JAY.

231
00:11:03,872 --> 00:11:05,457
PAIGE, DID YOU
BECOME A LESBIAN

232
00:11:05,541 --> 00:11:06,708
AND NOT TELL ME?

233
00:11:06,792 --> 00:11:08,460
NO, NO, HAZEL...

234
00:11:09,253 --> 00:11:10,504
I'M NOT A LESBIAN.

235
00:11:10,587 --> 00:11:12,923
HELLO!
MATT? SPINNER?

236
00:11:13,423 --> 00:11:14,800
I'VE DATED LOTS OF GUYS.

237
00:11:14,883 --> 00:11:18,428
WELL, THEN HOW COME JAY
SAW YOU KISSING ALEX?

238
00:11:18,512 --> 00:11:19,930
UM...

239
00:11:20,931 --> 00:11:22,850
I JUST...

240
00:11:23,141 --> 00:11:25,060
GOT CAUGHT UP
IN A MOMENT.

241
00:11:25,143 --> 00:11:26,436
AND THAT'S ALL?

242
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:28,146
OF COURSE.

243
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:30,566
IT WAS TOTALLY STUPID.

244
00:11:30,649 --> 00:11:32,025
IT MEANT NOTHING.

245
00:11:32,109 --> 00:11:34,111
SHE MEANS NOTHING.

246
00:11:50,252 --> 00:11:50,919
ALEX...

247
00:11:51,003 --> 00:11:52,629
DON'T BOTHER.

248
00:11:56,133 --> 00:11:57,968
HOW COULD YOU?

249
00:11:58,051 --> 00:12:01,930
I DO NOT LIKE GIRLS.
I CANNOT LIKE GIRLS.

250
00:12:02,848 --> 00:12:05,475
THEN WHY DID YOU
KISS ME?

251
00:12:07,352 --> 00:12:09,813
I DON'T KNOW.
I FELT BAD.

252
00:12:09,897 --> 00:12:12,566
I DIDN'T WANT
TO HURT YOU.

253
00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:14,568
WHO NEEDS YOUR PITY,
HUH?

254
00:12:14,651 --> 00:12:15,819
I DON'T!

255
00:12:24,203 --> 00:12:25,204
KEVIN:
WELL...

256
00:12:26,872 --> 00:12:27,372
OH, UM...

257
00:12:29,666 --> 00:12:32,920
EXCUSE ME WHILE I GO UH...
FLUSH MY HEAD DOWN THE TOILET.

258
00:12:34,004 --> 00:12:34,755
MS. HATZILAKOS:
OKAY, WE'RE READY TO BEGIN.

259
00:12:34,838 --> 00:12:38,342
CAN I HAVE EVERYONE'S
ATTENTION, PLEASE?

260
00:12:38,425 --> 00:12:39,259

261
00:12:40,093 --> 00:12:41,220
(LOUD MIC FEEDBACK)

262
00:12:41,303 --> 00:12:42,513
CAN I HAVE EVERYONE'S
ATTENTION!

263
00:12:42,596 --> 00:12:45,349
PLEASE GRAB YOUR SEATS,
WE'RE GONNA BEGIN.

264
00:12:45,432 --> 00:12:46,266
NOW!

265
00:12:47,809 --> 00:12:49,144
THANK YOU.

266
00:12:49,770 --> 00:12:51,188
AT THIS TIME LAST YEAR,

267
00:12:51,271 --> 00:12:54,733
DEGRASSI WAS STRUGGLING
OUT OF AN AWFUL TRAGEDY.

268
00:12:54,816 --> 00:12:57,236
AND THEN CAME KEVIN SMITH.

269
00:12:57,319 --> 00:12:59,279
(APPLAUSE AND CHEERING)

270
00:13:02,908 --> 00:13:05,702
HE CAST OUR SCHOOL
AS THE BACKDROP FOR HIS MOVIE

271
00:13:05,786 --> 00:13:09,122
"JAY AND SILENT BOB
GO CANADIAN, EH?"

272
00:13:09,206 --> 00:13:11,458
AND AS A TOKEN
OF OUR GRATITUDE,

273
00:13:11,542 --> 00:13:12,376
MR. SMITH...

274
00:13:13,961 --> 00:13:17,714
I WOULD LIKE TO PRESENT YOU
WITH AN HONORARY DIPLOMA.

275
00:13:17,798 --> 00:13:19,883
NO. THANK YOU.

276
00:13:19,967 --> 00:13:20,801
(APPLAUSE)

277
00:13:23,303 --> 00:13:26,431
BUT BEFORE WE MAKE IT
COMPLETEY OFFICIAL,

278
00:13:26,515 --> 00:13:29,142
OUR SPIRIT SQUAD WOULD LIKE
TO SEND YOU ON YOUR WAY,

279
00:13:29,226 --> 00:13:30,686
IN STYLE.

280
00:13:30,769 --> 00:13:31,395
PAIGE?

281
00:13:39,862 --> 00:13:41,613
WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?

282
00:13:42,322 --> 00:13:45,033
I HAVEN'T COME UP
WITH ANYTHING.

283
00:13:45,117 --> 00:13:46,368
JUST IMPROVISE.

284
00:13:48,495 --> 00:13:49,580
OKAY, UH... GO.

285
00:13:54,001 --> 00:13:56,044
DO SOME CARTWHEELS!
OKAY.

286
00:14:03,343 --> 00:14:04,511
PAIGE:
GIVE ME A "K"!

287
00:14:04,595 --> 00:14:05,262
"K!"

288
00:14:07,014 --> 00:14:08,140
PAIGE:
GIVE ME AN "E"!

289
00:14:08,223 --> 00:14:08,390
"E"?

290
00:14:10,434 --> 00:14:12,853
GIVE ME A...
V-I-N-S-M-I-T-H!

291
00:14:17,608 --> 00:14:17,941
YAY!

292
00:14:23,363 --> 00:14:23,655
UH...

293
00:14:25,282 --> 00:14:26,950
(SMATTERING OF APPLAUSE)

294
00:14:38,879 --> 00:14:40,714
MOM, I'M FINE.

295
00:14:40,797 --> 00:14:44,218
DON'T SEEM FINE TO ME,
LITTLE GIRL.

296
00:14:47,346 --> 00:14:49,348
BUENOS DIAS,
SENIORITAS!

297
00:14:50,265 --> 00:14:52,476
THAT'S NOT YOUR
MOTORCYCLE HELMET.

298
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:53,936
WHERE'S ALL THE KEVLAR?

299
00:14:54,019 --> 00:14:54,853
I SOLD IT.

300
00:14:56,522 --> 00:15:00,526
THE MOTORBIKE, THE HELMET,
THE WORKS, BECAUSE...

301
00:15:00,609 --> 00:15:02,444
WE'RE GOING TO MEXICO!

302
00:15:02,945 --> 00:15:06,490
YOU, ME, EMMA AND MANNY
WILL BE SPENDING A WEEK

303
00:15:06,573 --> 00:15:08,534
ON THE MAYAN RIVIERA
AT THE END OF TERM!

304
00:15:08,617 --> 00:15:10,202
BUT WHAT ABOUT JACK?

305
00:15:10,285 --> 00:15:11,245
THE GRANDMAS ARE ALREADY
FIGHTING FOR HIM!

306
00:15:11,328 --> 00:15:12,788
IT'S ALL BEEN TAKEN CARE OF.

307
00:15:12,871 --> 00:15:15,707
SPIKE:
OH... I LOVE YOU SO MUCH!

308
00:15:15,791 --> 00:15:18,836
I DON'T DESERVE
SUCH A PERFECT HUSBAND.

309
00:15:18,919 --> 00:15:20,754
STOP IT!
JUST STOP IT!

310
00:15:22,881 --> 00:15:23,799
EMMA?

311
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:27,469
WHAT IS IT,
SWEETHEART?

312
00:15:27,553 --> 00:15:29,805
TELL ME WHAT'S WRONG.

313
00:15:36,937 --> 00:15:38,105
IT'S ABOUT ME.

314
00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:40,899
IT'S...IT'S SOMETHING I DID.

315
00:15:46,613 --> 00:15:48,407
ALEX:
WHY IS IT THAT EVERY TIME
I TURN A CORNER,

316
00:15:48,490 --> 00:15:49,950
THERE YOU ARE?

317
00:15:50,033 --> 00:15:51,535
JAY:
I'M LIKE ONE OF THOSE
ANNOYING POP SONGS.

318
00:15:51,618 --> 00:15:52,911
ONCE I GET STUCK IN YOUR HEAD,

319
00:15:52,995 --> 00:15:54,371
I'M IMPOSSIBLE TO GET RID OF.

320
00:15:55,998 --> 00:15:57,833
WHAT DO YOU WANT, JAY?

321
00:15:57,916 --> 00:15:58,959
REALLY?

322
00:15:59,835 --> 00:16:01,003
MY LIFE SUCKS.

323
00:16:01,795 --> 00:16:03,463
OKAY, I'M KICKED OUT
OF SCHOOL,

324
00:16:03,547 --> 00:16:04,923
SEAN MOVED AWAY,

325
00:16:05,007 --> 00:16:07,467
SPINNER'S FOUND THE LORD...

326
00:16:07,551 --> 00:16:10,512
AND THE ONLY PERSON
WHO EVER REALLY GOT ME

327
00:16:10,596 --> 00:16:14,266
WON'T EVEN GIVE ME
THE TIME OF DAY.

328
00:16:14,349 --> 00:16:16,768
I'M NOT PERFECT,
I KNOW THAT.

329
00:16:18,228 --> 00:16:20,981
BUT... I GET YOU,
YOU KNOW?

330
00:16:21,064 --> 00:16:22,357
THE REAL YOU.

331
00:16:22,441 --> 00:16:25,611
'CAUSE YOU AND ME,
WERE THE SAME.

332
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,154
YOU KNOW? WHY-

333
00:16:27,237 --> 00:16:29,031
WHY DO YOU WANT
TO FIGHT THAT?

334
00:16:36,872 --> 00:16:37,664
KEVIN:
...SHOOT IT!

335
00:16:37,748 --> 00:16:39,082
PITCH THE ROCK, SIR,
PITCH IT!

336
00:16:39,166 --> 00:16:40,709
JASON:
WHAT'S UUUUUP!

337
00:16:40,792 --> 00:16:42,878
OH COME ON!
YOU SUUUCCCCCK!

338
00:16:44,713 --> 00:16:46,632
DON'T HATE THE PLAYER, SON,
HATE THE GAME.

339
00:16:46,715 --> 00:16:47,591
KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?

340
00:16:47,674 --> 00:16:49,343
OH, MISS MICHALCHUK!

341
00:16:50,010 --> 00:16:51,053
WANNA SHOOT SOME HORSE
WITH US?

342
00:16:51,136 --> 00:16:52,846
OR ARE YOU RUNNING OFF
TO A SPELLING BEE

343
00:16:52,930 --> 00:16:53,972
OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT?

344
00:16:54,056 --> 00:16:55,724
OH, ABOUT THE CHEER...

345
00:16:57,518 --> 00:17:01,230
PLEASE KNOW THAT I'VE COMPOSED
MORE CHEERY BEFORE.

346
00:17:01,313 --> 00:17:03,440
NOBODY'S EVER DONE A CHEER
IN MY HONOR, SO BY DEFAULT,

347
00:17:03,524 --> 00:17:04,525
YOUR CHEER, FOR ME,

348
00:17:04,608 --> 00:17:05,609
WAS ABOUT THE BEST
I'VE EVER HAD.

349
00:17:05,692 --> 00:17:06,735
SO THANK YOU.

350
00:17:07,402 --> 00:17:08,987
I WAS KINDA DISTRACTED.

351
00:17:09,071 --> 00:17:10,447
DISTRACTED, HUH?
LET ME GUESS,

352
00:17:10,531 --> 00:17:12,658
BY SOME KIND OF ACID-TONGUED,
RAVEN-HAIRED BEAUTY

353
00:17:12,741 --> 00:17:14,243
FROM THE WRONG SIDE
OF THE TRACKS, MAYBE?

354
00:17:14,326 --> 00:17:16,453
KEVIN, JASON,
YOUR TAXI'S HERE.

355
00:17:16,537 --> 00:17:19,122
KEVIN:
THANK YOU, MS. HATZILAKOS.

356
00:17:19,206 --> 00:17:22,626
LET ME ASK YOU A QUESTION.
DO YOU LIKE THIS GIRL?

357
00:17:22,709 --> 00:17:25,379
LIKE, YOU KNOW,
"LIKE HER" LIKE HER?

358
00:17:25,462 --> 00:17:27,256
YEAH, I LIKE HER,

359
00:17:27,339 --> 00:17:29,508
BUT I'M NOT GAY.

360
00:17:29,591 --> 00:17:31,802
MY BROTHER IS GAY,
I'M STRAIGHT.

361
00:17:31,885 --> 00:17:32,803
I ALWAYS HAVE BEEN.

362
00:17:32,886 --> 00:17:33,804
YOUR BROTHER'S GAY?

363
00:17:33,887 --> 00:17:35,013
MY BROTHER'S GAY,
TOO.

364
00:17:35,097 --> 00:17:36,640
EVEN GOT MARRIED
TO A GUY.

365
00:17:36,723 --> 00:17:37,140
REALLY?

366
00:17:37,224 --> 00:17:37,766
YEAH,

367
00:17:37,850 --> 00:17:39,726
IT WAS THE HOTTEST WEDDING
I'VE EVER BEEN TO IN MY LIFE.

368
00:17:39,810 --> 00:17:40,811
REALLY, REALLY COOL,
HANDS DOWN.

369
00:17:40,894 --> 00:17:43,480
ALMOST MADE ME WANT
TO SWITCH TEAMS.

370
00:17:43,564 --> 00:17:44,690
ALMOST.

371
00:17:44,773 --> 00:17:46,233
LOOK, I'M PROBABLY
THE LAST GUY IN THE WORLD

372
00:17:46,316 --> 00:17:48,402
WHO SHOULD BE GIVING YOU
ADVICE ON THIS VERY SUBJECT,

373
00:17:48,485 --> 00:17:49,987
BUT I DON'T KNOW...

374
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:52,739
YOU GUYS SEEMED HAPPY
THE OTHER NIGHT, YOU KNOW?

375
00:17:52,823 --> 00:17:54,199
AND THAT'S KINDA RARE

376
00:17:54,283 --> 00:17:57,494
AND WHETHER IT'S GAY,
STRAIGHT, BI, WHATEVER,

377
00:17:57,578 --> 00:18:00,664
IT'S KINDA WORTH INVESTIGATING
A LITTLE FURTHER, I'D SAY.

378
00:18:00,747 --> 00:18:02,749
JUST MY TWO CENTS.

379
00:18:05,627 --> 00:18:06,837
YOU'RE JUST GONNA
STAND THERE

380
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:07,462
STARIN' AT ME

381
00:18:07,546 --> 00:18:09,715
AFTER I'VE DROPPED
THAT WISDOM ON YOU?

382
00:18:09,798 --> 00:18:10,799
C'MON,
THAT'S YOUR MOVE!

383
00:18:10,883 --> 00:18:12,593
GO CHASE THE GIRL,
SILLY!

384
00:18:16,013 --> 00:18:17,723
SIMPSON:
IT WAS A MISTAKE!
IT WAS JUST A KISS!

385
00:18:17,806 --> 00:18:19,892
SPIKE:
WHAT ABOUT EMMA?
WHAT ABOUT HER FEELINGS?

386
00:18:19,975 --> 00:18:20,475
SIMPSON:
LOOK, BELIEVE ME,

387
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:22,561
IT WAS NEVER MY INTENTION
TO INVOLVE HER IN THIS.

388
00:18:22,644 --> 00:18:23,437
SPIKE:
JUST GO!

389
00:18:32,279 --> 00:18:33,238
I'M SO SORRY,
EMMA.

390
00:18:33,322 --> 00:18:35,157
BUT I'M GONNA GO
STAY AT JOEY'S,

391
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:35,991
JUST FOR AWHILE.

392
00:18:36,867 --> 00:18:38,285
NO! NO, YOU CAN'T!

393
00:18:38,368 --> 00:18:39,995
GO UP THERE AND CONVINCE HER
TO LET YOU STAY.

394
00:18:40,078 --> 00:18:41,830
EMMA, LISTEN...

395
00:18:42,581 --> 00:18:45,751
WHAT I DID
WAS HORRIBLE BUT...

396
00:18:45,834 --> 00:18:46,668
I WOULD NEVER
HAVE DONE IT

397
00:18:46,752 --> 00:18:49,796
IF THERE WASN'T SOMETHING
WRONG WITH ME.

398
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:51,673
I GOTTA GO FIGURE
THAT OUT.

399
00:18:51,757 --> 00:18:54,009
DO YOU LOVE MY MOTHER?

400
00:18:54,092 --> 00:18:54,843
OF COURSE.

401
00:18:54,927 --> 00:18:55,886
AND JACK?

402
00:18:55,969 --> 00:18:57,804
EM, HE'S MY SON.

403
00:18:58,430 --> 00:19:00,098
WHAT ABOUT ME?

404
00:19:01,183 --> 00:19:02,851
YOU KNOW I DO.

405
00:19:04,102 --> 00:19:06,688
SO WHAT'S TO FIGURE OUT?!

406
00:19:15,489 --> 00:19:16,240
(SOBBING)

407
00:19:22,955 --> 00:19:24,039
JAY:
THIS IS NICE, HUH?

408
00:19:24,748 --> 00:19:26,917
JUST LIKE OLD TIMES.

409
00:19:28,794 --> 00:19:30,546
I SAID YOU COULD COME IN
AND WATCH TV, JAY.

410
00:19:30,629 --> 00:19:31,630
THAT'S ALL.

411
00:19:31,713 --> 00:19:33,924
THIS DOESN'T
MEAN ANYTHING.

412
00:19:34,007 --> 00:19:35,676
YEAH, SURE, LEXI.
WHATEVER YOU SAY.

413
00:19:35,759 --> 00:19:36,760
(DOOR SLAMS)

414
00:19:37,761 --> 00:19:38,554
CHAD.

415
00:19:38,637 --> 00:19:39,137
HEEEY!

416
00:19:41,390 --> 00:19:43,433
IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME.
YOU BEEN WORKING HARD?

417
00:19:43,517 --> 00:19:45,269
NO, HARDLY WORKING!

418
00:19:45,352 --> 00:19:46,687
WHERE ARE YOU AT,
BUD?

419
00:19:46,770 --> 00:19:47,521
OH YOU KNOW,
HERE AND THERE.

420
00:19:47,604 --> 00:19:50,357
JUST TRYING TO KEEP
MYSELF OUT OF TROUBLE.

421
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:53,861
EMILY:
OH GIMME SOME SUGAR,
YOU HANDSOME DEVIL! HELLO.

422
00:19:53,944 --> 00:19:54,903
LOOK AT YOU...

423
00:19:54,987 --> 00:19:58,740
YOU ARE LOOKING AS BEAUTIFUL
AS EVER, EMILY.

424
00:19:58,824 --> 00:20:00,075
AW, SUCH A CHARMER!

425
00:20:00,158 --> 00:20:02,828
I ALWAYS KNEW THIS ONE
WAS A KEEPER, LEXI.

426
00:20:02,911 --> 00:20:05,706
SORT OF REMINDS ME
OF OL' CHAD HERE.

427
00:20:05,789 --> 00:20:07,749
I AM SO GLAD THAT YOU FINALLY
CAME TO YOUR SENSES

428
00:20:07,833 --> 00:20:10,460
AND TOOK JAY BACK,
BABY.

429
00:20:10,544 --> 00:20:13,005
I HAVEN'T TAKEN
HIM BACK.

430
00:20:13,088 --> 00:20:14,923
WELL, NOT YET.

431
00:20:15,007 --> 00:20:16,633
NO! NOT EVER!

432
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:19,553
I NEED SOME AIR.

433
00:20:19,636 --> 00:20:20,554
'KAY.

434
00:20:31,106 --> 00:20:33,066
I'VE BEEN TRYING
TO WORK UP THE NERVE

435
00:20:33,150 --> 00:20:34,985
TO RING THE DOORBELL.

436
00:20:35,068 --> 00:20:36,820
WE DON'T HAVE ONE.

437
00:20:36,904 --> 00:20:39,072
WELCOME TO MY WORLD.

438
00:20:39,573 --> 00:20:42,242
ANY ROOM IN IT
FOR A STUPID GIRL?

439
00:20:42,326 --> 00:20:44,077
I ALREADY HAVE
ONE OF THOSE.

440
00:20:44,161 --> 00:20:46,830
WELL, HOW ABOUT...
ROOM FOR...

441
00:20:48,332 --> 00:20:52,461
SOMEONE WHO'S READY
TO STOP WORRYING SO MUCH

442
00:20:52,544 --> 00:20:55,547
ABOUT WHAT OTHER
PEOPLE THINK?

443
00:20:57,299 --> 00:20:59,635
MIGHT BE ROOM FOR HER.

444
00:21:00,552 --> 00:21:03,639
ALEX,
I'M SORRY ABOUT BEFORE...

445
00:21:04,348 --> 00:21:05,933
WHAT I SAID.

446
00:21:06,016 --> 00:21:08,060
WHATEVER PAIGE,
IT'S COOL.

447
00:21:08,143 --> 00:21:09,728
NO, IT'S NOT.

448
00:21:11,855 --> 00:21:13,607
I SAID YOU WERE
NOTHING TO ME,

449
00:21:13,690 --> 00:21:15,150
WHICH...

450
00:21:15,234 --> 00:21:16,985
WHICH IS A TOTAL LIE.

451
00:21:17,653 --> 00:21:19,655
BECAUSE RIGHT NOW?

452
00:21:23,534 --> 00:21:24,952
YOU'RE PRETTY MUCH EVERYTHING.
