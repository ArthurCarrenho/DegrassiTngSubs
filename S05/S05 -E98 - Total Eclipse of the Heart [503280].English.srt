OKAY.

180
00:07:45,424 --> 00:07:47,009
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

181
00:07:47,092 --> 00:07:48,302
DID PAIGE
PUT YOU UP TO THIS?

182
00:07:48,385 --> 00:07:49,720
NO. I DID.

183
00:07:51,054 --> 00:07:53,015
JUST HEAR ME OUT.

184
00:07:54,433 --> 00:07:55,767
I MISS US.

185
00:07:57,144 --> 00:07:58,520
I MISS YOU.

186
00:07:58,604 --> 00:08:01,148
YOU'RE CUTE,
YOU'RE SMART,

187
00:08:01,773 --> 00:08:03,734
AND YOU'RE FUNNY.

188
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:06,653
AND I MADE A HUGE
MISTAKE.

189
00:08:06,737 --> 00:08:07,946
YEAH.

190
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:10,532
YOU DID MISTAKE, DYLAN,
TONIGHT.

191
00:08:10,616 --> 00:08:12,117
COMING HERE.

192
00:08:12,201 --> 00:08:15,704
I'M WITH TIM NOW.
HE'S MY BOYFRIEND.

193
00:08:17,915 --> 00:08:19,416
UM...
SORRY FOR INTERRUPTING,

194
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:24,004
BUT I WAS JUST GONNA GO
GET SOME MORE WATER AND-

195
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:43,982
ELLIE:
OKAY, SO...

196
00:08:44,066 --> 00:08:46,902
JANE EYRE, WHICH I FINISHED
READING AN HOUR AGO -

197
00:08:46,985 --> 00:08:47,903
DON'T GET IT.

198
00:08:47,986 --> 00:08:48,904
MARCO:
OKAY, THINK OF IT THIS WAY.

199
00:08:48,987 --> 00:08:49,738
I'M ROCHESTER-

200
00:08:49,821 --> 00:08:50,739
OF COURSE.

201
00:08:50,822 --> 00:08:51,949
YEAH.
TIM IS JANE EYRE

202
00:08:52,032 --> 00:08:53,200
YOU KNOW, BECAUSE HE'S SIMPLE,
SWEET,

203
00:08:53,283 --> 00:08:54,493
AND UNCOMPLICATED.

204
00:08:54,576 --> 00:08:56,620
AND DYLAN
IS CRAZY BERTHA,

205
00:08:56,703 --> 00:08:59,331
LOCKED AWAY
IN THE ATTIC.

206
00:09:00,165 --> 00:09:01,250
OKAY,
IT'S ABOUT MOVING ON

207
00:09:01,333 --> 00:09:03,126
AND PUTTING THE PAST
BEHIND YOU,

208
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:03,752
WITH THE RIGHT PEOPLE.

209
00:09:03,836 --> 00:09:06,505
JUST THINK OF IT
LIKE SALVATION.

210
00:09:07,297 --> 00:09:09,508
(PHONE RINGS)
HOLD UP.

211
00:09:09,591 --> 00:09:12,177
MUST BE ANOTHER EMAIL
FROM TIM.

212
00:09:12,261 --> 00:09:14,012
OKAY, THAT THING
IS ONE STEP AWAY

213
00:09:14,096 --> 00:09:16,390
FROM YOU BECOMING
AN ANDROID.

214
00:09:16,473 --> 00:09:18,308
IT'S FROM DYLAN.

215
00:09:23,689 --> 00:09:24,565
WE ARE THROUGH!

216
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:26,275
OVER!

217
00:09:26,358 --> 00:09:29,403
SO DON'T SEND ME
STUPID LITTLE EMAILS.

218
00:09:29,486 --> 00:09:31,071
YOU CAME ALL THE WAY
TO MY PLACE

219
00:09:31,154 --> 00:09:32,990
TO TELL ME
NOT TO EMAIL YOU?

220
00:09:33,073 --> 00:09:34,074
RIGHT.

221
00:09:37,995 --> 00:09:38,704
THIS IS
SO NOT OVER,

222
00:09:38,787 --> 00:09:40,664
NOT EVEN CLOSE.

223
00:09:40,747 --> 00:09:42,374
WHY NOW? HUH?

224
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,793
WHAT IS WITH
THE STALKER ROUTINE?

225
00:09:44,877 --> 00:09:47,838
WHY? YOU JUST HAPPEN TO BE HOME
FOR THE SUMMER?

226
00:09:47,921 --> 00:09:49,047
YOU DON'T GET IT,
DO YOU?

227
00:09:49,131 --> 00:09:52,885
I'M HOME FOR THE SUMMER
BECAUSE OF YOU.

228
00:09:54,887 --> 00:09:56,180
I STILL LOVE YOU,
MARCO.

229
00:09:56,263 --> 00:09:57,681
MARCO:
DON'T.

230
00:09:57,764 --> 00:09:58,807
DON'T CALL ME.

231
00:09:58,891 --> 00:09:59,808
DON'T TEXT ME.

232
00:09:59,892 --> 00:10:01,143
DON'T EMAIL ME.

233
00:10:01,226 --> 00:10:03,896
DON'T EVEN THINK
ABOUT ME.

234
00:10:04,521 --> 00:10:06,231
LEAVE ME ALONE.

235
00:10:26,043 --> 00:10:28,378
ALL RIGHT GUYS,
TIME'S UP.

236
00:10:28,462 --> 00:10:29,755
PASS 'EM IN.

237
00:10:29,838 --> 00:10:31,381
I DIDN'T EVEN
FINISH THE EXAM.

238
00:10:31,465 --> 00:10:34,551
HOW DID YOU GET IT DONE
SO QUICKLY?

239
00:10:34,635 --> 00:10:37,638
MAYBE BECAUSE
I NEVER STARTED.

240
00:10:53,403 --> 00:10:54,238
HEY...

241
00:10:55,113 --> 00:10:55,864
HI.

242
00:10:56,532 --> 00:10:59,117
SO I KNOW YOU ONLY
HAVE ONE MORE EXAM LEFT,

243
00:10:59,201 --> 00:11:01,703
AND I SHOULD HAVE GIVEN THIS
TO YOU BEFORE,

244
00:11:01,787 --> 00:11:02,788
BUT...

245
00:11:05,791 --> 00:11:07,835
MARCO:
OH... (CHUCKLES)

246
00:11:07,918 --> 00:11:09,419
WOW. THANKS.

247
00:11:10,504 --> 00:11:13,340
GOOD LUCK
NEVER GOES OUT OF STYLE.

248
00:11:24,852 --> 00:11:25,978
KWAN:
TIME'S UP, EVERYONE.

249
00:11:26,061 --> 00:11:27,145
HAND THEM IN.

250
00:11:27,229 --> 00:11:29,731
AND CONGRATS,
EXAMS ARE DONE!

251
00:11:37,322 --> 00:11:38,740
I'M SO TIRED,

252
00:11:38,824 --> 00:11:41,743
I THINK I MIGHT HAVE ANSWERED
THE SECOND ESSAY QUESTION

253
00:11:41,827 --> 00:11:44,496
WITH WHITE STRIPES LYRICS.

254
00:11:45,205 --> 00:11:46,373
(MARCO LAUGHS)

255
00:11:48,292 --> 00:11:49,459
SO WHAT DO YOU SAY

256
00:11:49,543 --> 00:11:52,129
TO A LITTLE RYAN REYNOLDS
MOVIE FIESTA TONIGHT?

257
00:11:52,212 --> 00:11:54,214
OH YES,
I AM SO IN.

258
00:11:54,756 --> 00:11:56,425
OH BUT... TIM.

259
00:11:57,134 --> 00:11:58,802
I KINDA PROMISED HIM
A DATE.

260
00:11:58,886 --> 00:11:59,970
OH. UM...

261
00:12:00,679 --> 00:12:01,930
WELL, BRING HIM.

262
00:12:02,014 --> 00:12:03,140
WE'LL GIVE HIM
A GOOD GOING OVER.

263
00:12:03,223 --> 00:12:05,142
MAKE SURE HE'S GOOD ENOUGH
FOR OUR MARCO.

264
00:12:05,225 --> 00:12:07,352
AND THE SATAN CHILD?

265
00:12:07,436 --> 00:12:09,438
HOCKEY PRACTICE.
SO?

266
00:12:09,521 --> 00:12:11,732
SO, I'LL BRING THE CHIPS.

267
00:12:11,815 --> 00:12:12,399
GOOD. SEE YOU.

268
00:12:12,482 --> 00:12:13,400
COOL.

269
00:12:19,948 --> 00:12:21,950
IT WAS ONE STUPID EXAM.

270
00:12:22,034 --> 00:12:23,952
WORTH 30 PERCENT
OF YOUR GRADE.

271
00:12:24,036 --> 00:12:24,286
SO?

272
00:12:25,454 --> 00:12:26,788
YOU DON'T CARE?

273
00:12:26,872 --> 00:12:28,624
I DON'T UNDERSTAND YOU.

274
00:12:28,707 --> 00:12:29,833
THIS ISN'T THE GIRL
I KNOW.

275
00:12:29,917 --> 00:12:31,210
MRS. VAN ZANDT:
HAROLD, STOP.

276
00:12:31,293 --> 00:12:34,671
DANNY:
DEREK AND I ARE SUPPOSED TO BE
STUDYING HERE TONIGHT, DAD.

277
00:12:34,755 --> 00:12:37,299
AND YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE
AT A PLAY, REMEMBER?

278
00:12:37,382 --> 00:12:38,383
MM-HM.

279
00:12:40,552 --> 00:12:42,054
THIS ISN'T OVER.

280
00:12:42,137 --> 00:12:44,056
WE WON'T BE LATE.

281
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:55,484
DANNY:
I APPRECIATE YOU BEING
THE DEMON SEED

282
00:12:55,567 --> 00:12:57,736
AND TAKING THE HEAT OFF ME,

283
00:12:57,819 --> 00:13:00,739
BUT I HAVE A REPUTATION
TO UPHOLD.

284
00:13:02,741 --> 00:13:04,910
FEMALE ANATOMY 101.

285
00:13:23,428 --> 00:13:25,013
TO ALBERT EINSTEIN!

286
00:13:28,517 --> 00:13:29,184
(COUGHS)

287
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:35,524
DAD DOESN'T KNOW
WHO I AM ANYMORE,

288
00:13:35,607 --> 00:13:38,527
SO LET'S REALLY MESS
WITH HIS MIND.

289
00:13:47,953 --> 00:13:49,788
PAIGE:
OKAY, DON'T FREAK.

290
00:13:49,872 --> 00:13:52,124
DYLAN PROMISED HE'D BE
OUT OF HERE BY NOW.

291
00:13:52,207 --> 00:13:53,375
MARCO:
WHAT?

292
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:55,210
(GROANS)
PAIGE...

293
00:13:55,294 --> 00:13:56,044
PAIGE:
IT'S NO BIG DEAL.

294
00:13:56,128 --> 00:13:58,255
WE'LL BE WATCHING
IN THE BASEMENT ANYWAYS.

295
00:13:58,338 --> 00:13:59,882
COME ON,
EVERYONE'S DOWNSTAIRS.

296
00:13:59,965 --> 00:14:01,550
ANTOINE,
BEFORE YOU GO, MAN.

297
00:14:01,633 --> 00:14:03,552
CHECK OUT MY TATTOO.

298
00:14:03,635 --> 00:14:06,263
DUDE!
THAT'S AWESOME.

299
00:14:11,643 --> 00:14:12,686
TIM:
UM...

300
00:14:12,769 --> 00:14:15,314
MARCO, WHAT ABOUT THAT RYAN
REYNOLDS MOVIE FIESTA

301
00:14:15,397 --> 00:14:16,732
THAT YOU PROMISED?

302
00:14:16,815 --> 00:14:19,568
YEAH. YEAH.
LET'S GO. COOL.

303
00:14:21,904 --> 00:14:23,739
HOCKEY PRACTICE IS CANCELLED.

304
00:14:23,822 --> 00:14:26,283
WHY DON'T YOU GUYS JOIN ME
FOR A LITTLE POKER?

305
00:14:26,366 --> 00:14:27,367
TEXAS HOLD 'EM?

306
00:14:27,451 --> 00:14:28,076
NO THANKS.

307
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:30,287
I THINK WE'RE GONNA PASS
ON THAT ONE.

308
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:32,456
I FIGURED
YOU'D WIMP OUT.

309
00:14:34,333 --> 00:14:35,167
EXCUSE ME?

310
00:14:35,792 --> 00:14:37,628
COME ON, MARCO,
WHO'RE YOU KIDDING?

311
00:14:37,711 --> 00:14:39,296
YOU'RE ALWAYS
"PLAYING IT SAFE".

312
00:14:39,379 --> 00:14:42,132
YOU'RE WAY TOO CHICKEN
TO GAMBLE.

313
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:43,884
REALLY?

314
00:14:48,764 --> 00:14:50,766
WHAT'S THE BUY-IN?

315
00:14:54,478 --> 00:14:56,480
(SLURRING)
AND HERE'S TO DRESSING ME
IN OVERALLS

316
00:14:56,563 --> 00:14:58,524
UNTIL GRADE NINE.

317
00:14:59,233 --> 00:15:02,444
UH, YOU MIGHT WANNA
PACE YOURSELF.

318
00:15:02,528 --> 00:15:04,571
YEAH. WELL,
I THINK THAT YOU THINK...

319
00:15:04,655 --> 00:15:07,824
THAT I THINK
THAT YOU THINK...

320
00:15:09,201 --> 00:15:11,411
ATTENTION.
SOFTWARE GLITCH.

321
00:15:11,495 --> 00:15:12,913
DEREK:
I THINK...

322
00:15:12,996 --> 00:15:14,998
YOU'VE HAD ENOUGH.

323
00:15:17,417 --> 00:15:18,836
LIBERTY:
(STRUGGLING)
LET GO! LET GO!

324
00:15:18,919 --> 00:15:20,087
(MIRROR SHATTERS)

325
00:15:20,838 --> 00:15:22,089
OH NO.

326
00:15:22,172 --> 00:15:23,549
NO, NO, NO.

327
00:15:25,092 --> 00:15:26,802
MOM AND DAD
ARE GONNA KILL ME.

328
00:15:26,885 --> 00:15:29,596
I'M A STUPID, USELESS,
MESSED UP...

329
00:15:31,265 --> 00:15:33,225
LIBERTY, IT'S A MIRROR.

330
00:15:33,308 --> 00:15:34,810
YOUR FACE DIDN'T BREAK IT
THIS TIME,

331
00:15:34,893 --> 00:15:36,228
SO WHY SO UPSET?

332
00:15:39,898 --> 00:15:41,900
BECAUSE MY BABY IS GONE.

333
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:46,655
HE'S GONE ACROSS THE COUNTRY

334
00:15:46,738 --> 00:15:48,407
AND I ABANDONED HIM.

335
00:15:51,034 --> 00:15:54,580
DEREK:
I NEVER GOT TO MEET
MY BIRTH-MOTHER.

336
00:15:56,373 --> 00:15:58,625
NOT SURE I EVER WILL.

337
00:15:59,585 --> 00:16:01,170
SHE COULDN'T TAKE CARE OF ME,

338
00:16:01,253 --> 00:16:05,841
SO SHE MADE SURE I ENDED UP
IN A FAMILY THAT COULD.

339
00:16:05,924 --> 00:16:09,052
I KNOW IT WAS HARD
FOR HER TO DO.

340
00:16:09,136 --> 00:16:10,637
HOW DO YOU KNOW
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED?

341
00:16:10,721 --> 00:16:11,805
DEREK:
SHE TOLD ME.

342
00:16:11,889 --> 00:16:14,057
I MEAN, IN A LETTER.

343
00:16:15,392 --> 00:16:18,979
SHE GAVE ME A SORT
OF TREASURE CHEST.

344
00:16:28,155 --> 00:16:29,823
I SEE YOUR TWO

345
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:33,452
AND RAISE FOUR.

346
00:16:36,538 --> 00:16:38,165
SEE YOU BACK.

347
00:16:38,248 --> 00:16:39,958
BY RAISING TEN?

348
00:16:40,667 --> 00:16:41,502
TIM!

349
00:16:42,878 --> 00:16:44,004
I'M SORRY,
THEY WERE ALL MESSY.

350
00:16:46,423 --> 00:16:47,799
DYLAN:
UH!

351
00:16:47,883 --> 00:16:49,968
BET'S ON THE TABLE.

352
00:16:58,227 --> 00:16:59,394
ALL... IN.

353
00:17:06,777 --> 00:17:09,696
MARCO, MAYBE
YOU SHOULD FOLD.

354
00:17:14,868 --> 00:17:17,287
YOU SURE YOU WANT
TO DO THAT, DEL ROSSI?

355
00:17:17,371 --> 00:17:18,664
PRETTY RECKLESS.

356
00:17:18,747 --> 00:17:20,624
THAT'S WHAT BEING RECKLESS
IS ALL ABOUT, MY FRIEND.

357
00:17:20,707 --> 00:17:22,626
JUST DOING,
NOT THINKING.

358
00:17:22,709 --> 00:17:26,547
HURTING WHOEVER YOU WANT
IN THE PROCESS.

359
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:31,385
WHAT THE HELL
IS YOUR PROBLEM?

360
00:17:31,468 --> 00:17:32,094
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

361
00:17:32,177 --> 00:17:33,262
I WANT TO KNOW
WHY YOU HURT ME?

362
00:17:33,345 --> 00:17:34,137
HOW?!

363
00:17:34,221 --> 00:17:36,265
HOW YOU COULD JUST HURT ME
LIKE THAT, DYLAN?!

364
00:17:36,348 --> 00:17:36,515
I...

365
00:17:38,642 --> 00:17:40,227
I DON'T KNOW.

366
00:17:40,811 --> 00:17:41,603
BUT I'VE APOLOGIZED

367
00:17:41,687 --> 00:17:43,438
AND I'VE TRIED
TO MAKE THINGS BETTER.

368
00:17:43,522 --> 00:17:44,773
SO I'M NOT GONNA KEEP
BEATING MYSELF UP

369
00:17:44,857 --> 00:17:45,607
JUST BECAUSE YOU'RE STUCK.

370
00:17:45,691 --> 00:17:46,942
OH,
I'M NOT STUCK.

371
00:17:47,025 --> 00:17:48,777
YOU ARE.

372
00:17:48,861 --> 00:17:51,280
DATE TIM,
PLAY IT SAFE.

373
00:17:52,197 --> 00:17:54,408
DATE A BUNCH OF GUYS.

374
00:17:54,491 --> 00:17:55,742
THAT DOESN'T CHANGE
THE FACT

375
00:17:55,826 --> 00:17:59,746
THAT EVERYTHING COMES DOWN
TO YOU AND ME.

376
00:18:01,707 --> 00:18:03,083
EVERYTHING.

377
00:18:11,091 --> 00:18:12,676
TIM:
DYLAN'S CRAZY.

378
00:18:12,759 --> 00:18:16,263
I MEAN, WHAT HE SAID
WAS TOTALLY OUT OF LINE.

379
00:18:16,346 --> 00:18:18,140
I MEAN,
'CAUSE YOU KNOW,

380
00:18:18,223 --> 00:18:20,309
WE'RE GOOD FOR EACH OTHER,
RIGHT?

381
00:18:20,392 --> 00:18:22,144
TIM, YOU'RE GREAT.

382
00:18:22,227 --> 00:18:25,105
OH, YOU'RE PERFECT,
ACTUALLY.

383
00:18:25,189 --> 00:18:25,939
AND I'M-

384
00:18:26,023 --> 00:18:27,441
HEY LOOK, I'M REALLY PROUD
OF ALL THE STEPS

385
00:18:27,524 --> 00:18:29,026
YOU'VE TAKEN THIS YEAR.

386
00:18:29,109 --> 00:18:30,819
WELL,
IT'S ALL BECAUSE OF YOU.

387
00:18:30,903 --> 00:18:32,070
AND I'M THINKING THAT,

388
00:18:32,154 --> 00:18:34,114
YOU KNOW, YOU'RE GONNA BE
AWAY NEXT YEAR BUT...

389
00:18:34,198 --> 00:18:35,324
I'LL CAN COME VISIT.

390
00:18:35,407 --> 00:18:36,700
AND I'VE GOT
A BUS SCHEDULE,

391
00:18:36,783 --> 00:18:37,618
AND I'VE MAPPED OUT
SOME TIMES-

392
00:18:37,701 --> 00:18:38,535
TIM!

393
00:18:40,495 --> 00:18:42,831
I...I WANTED TO MOVE ON.

394
00:18:45,876 --> 00:18:48,879
YOU AND I,
WE CONNECTED BUT...

395
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:54,510
MARCO, I GET HOW DIFFICULT
THESE THINGS CAN BE,

396
00:18:54,593 --> 00:18:56,178
AND HOW MUCH DYLAN
MEANT TO YOU.

397
00:18:56,261 --> 00:18:59,431
THAT'S EXACTLY THE POINT.

398
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,685
TIM, HE STILL DOES.

399
00:19:07,147 --> 00:19:08,649
YOU USED ME.

400
00:19:09,733 --> 00:19:11,109
NO.

401
00:19:11,193 --> 00:19:13,946
NO. NO.
I WOULDN'T DO THAT.

402
00:19:14,029 --> 00:19:15,697
I'M REALLY SORRY.

403
00:19:15,781 --> 00:19:19,952
GO BACK TO YOUR STUPID,
LYING, CHEATING EX.

404
00:19:20,035 --> 00:19:22,371
'CAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT,
MARCO?

405
00:19:22,454 --> 00:19:24,957
YOU ARE PERFECT FOR HIM.

406
00:19:35,717 --> 00:19:37,803
DEREK:
SO YOU'RE BOTH GROUNDED
FOR A MONTH?

407
00:19:37,886 --> 00:19:41,306
DANNY:
AND I DIDN'T EVEN GET TO SEE
LIBERTY PUKE HER GUTS OUT.

408
00:19:41,390 --> 00:19:43,600
JUST WHAT EVERY KID
NEEDS TO KNOW:

409
00:19:43,684 --> 00:19:45,769
THE INNER WORKINGS
OF DEGRASSI.

410
00:19:45,853 --> 00:19:48,188
DEREK:
WELL, IT'S A PART OF YOU,
RIGHT?

411
00:19:48,272 --> 00:19:49,189
JT:
HERE IT IS,

412
00:19:49,273 --> 00:19:51,859
ISSUE NUMBER ONE
OF "THE CRIMSON KID".

413
00:19:51,942 --> 00:19:53,777
A COMIC BOOK, JT?

414
00:19:53,861 --> 00:19:54,862
YEAH.

415
00:19:54,945 --> 00:19:56,947
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
HOW MUCH THAT'S WORTH?

416
00:19:57,030 --> 00:19:58,240
IT'S MY MOST VALUABLE
POSSESSION,

417
00:19:58,323 --> 00:20:00,617
AND I WANT HIM TO HAVE IT.

418
00:20:00,701 --> 00:20:01,869
WELL, I'D LIKE IT
IF BOTH OF YOU

419
00:20:01,952 --> 00:20:03,745
PUT SOMETHING IN AS WELL.

420
00:20:03,829 --> 00:20:05,706
I WANT THE BABY TO KNOW
HE HAD LOTS OF GOOD PEOPLE

421
00:20:05,789 --> 00:20:07,624
THINKING OF HIM.

422
00:20:47,414 --> 00:20:50,000
DYLAN, IF YOU EVER
HURT ME AGAIN, I...

423
00:20:50,083 --> 00:20:51,251
I WON'T.

424
00:20:53,045 --> 00:20:56,757
HEY, EVEN IDIOTS GROW UP
AT SOME POINT.

425
00:20:58,300 --> 00:20:59,718
I'M A SLOB.

426
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:03,263
OKAY?
I'M RECKLESS.

427
00:21:05,182 --> 00:21:08,018
AND I'M YOUR EXACT OPPOSITE.

428
00:21:08,727 --> 00:21:12,314
BUT YOU MEAN EVERYTHING
TO ME, MARCO,

429
00:21:13,357 --> 00:21:16,026
AND I WANT
ANOTHER CHANCE.

430
00:21:19,029 --> 00:21:21,406
OH,
YOU ARE SUCH A JERK.

431
00:21:21,490 --> 00:21:22,783
WHAT? I...
