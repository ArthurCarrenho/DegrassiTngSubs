NO ONE'S BEEN BACK THERE.
HONEST.

181
00:08:51,448 --> 00:08:53,700
YOU DON'T THINK SOMETHING'S
BEEN STOLEN, RIGHT?

182
00:08:53,784 --> 00:08:55,953
NO. I DIDN'T SAY
ANYTHING'S BEEN STOLEN.

183
00:08:56,036 --> 00:08:56,912
RIGHT. WELL...

184
00:08:56,995 --> 00:08:57,955
I JUST GUESSED

185
00:08:58,038 --> 00:09:01,041
BASED ON YOUR
WORRIED EXPRESSION.

186
00:09:01,124 --> 00:09:03,544
WELL, WE'RE MISSING
A GREAT DEAL OF OXYCODONE.

187
00:09:03,627 --> 00:09:04,628
IT'S A POWERFUL DRUG,

188
00:09:04,711 --> 00:09:06,547
SO YOU CAN UNDERSTAND
MY CONCERN.

189
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:07,673
YUP.

190
00:09:07,756 --> 00:09:11,093
YEAH, IT'S-IT'S TOTALLY
UNDERSTANDABLE.

191
00:09:11,176 --> 00:09:12,803
SEE OR HEAR ANYTHING,

192
00:09:12,886 --> 00:09:14,805
YOU TELL ME,
HUH?

193
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:26,400
WHAT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT
ELEMENT OF A RELATIONSHIP?

194
00:09:27,276 --> 00:09:29,611
I DON'T KNOW.
LOVE?

195
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:30,863
HONESTY.

196
00:09:31,530 --> 00:09:34,116
SO TELL ME,
HONESTLY,

197
00:09:34,199 --> 00:09:36,034
THE MISSING DRUGS
AND THE APARTMENT -

198
00:09:36,118 --> 00:09:37,828
NO RELATION?

199
00:09:38,537 --> 00:09:40,497
I JUST THOUGHT
IT WAS A GOOD IDEA.

200
00:09:43,667 --> 00:09:46,420
YOU STUPID, THOUGHTLESS,
IMBECILE!

201
00:09:46,503 --> 00:09:47,921
YOU WILL DESTROY EVERYTHING.

202
00:09:48,005 --> 00:09:49,256
OW! STOP!

203
00:09:52,843 --> 00:09:53,719
YOU COULD GO TO JAIL.

204
00:09:53,802 --> 00:09:55,888
YES, THAT THOUGHT
CROSSED MY MIND.

205
00:09:55,971 --> 00:09:57,347
THEN WHY DID YOU DO IT?

206
00:09:57,431 --> 00:09:59,892
WE NEEDED THE MONEY,
OKAY? BAD.

207
00:09:59,975 --> 00:10:01,727
LOOK, I'LL JUST-
I'LL GET SOME CASH

208
00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:03,270
AND I'LL BUY THE DRUGS
BACK FROM THE DEALER.

209
00:10:03,353 --> 00:10:05,606
AND THEN I'LL GIVE THE DRUGS
BACK TO THE PHARMACY.

210
00:10:05,689 --> 00:10:07,608
AND EVERYTHING WILL BE FINE,
OKAY?

211
00:10:07,691 --> 00:10:09,276
HONEST.

212
00:10:09,359 --> 00:10:11,778
WAY TO GET MY HOPES UP.

213
00:10:16,283 --> 00:10:19,328
TOBY:
COME ON FIT.
IT'S FOR CHARITY!

214
00:10:20,037 --> 00:10:22,039
JT:
LIBERTY MADE IT LOOK SO EASY.

215
00:10:22,122 --> 00:10:25,083
TOBY:
REMIND ME NOT TO TAKE ANYTHING
ELSE OFF HER PLATE.

216
00:10:25,167 --> 00:10:27,669
IS THE LAST PARAGRAPH
OF AN ARTICLE REALLY NECESSARY?

217
00:10:28,754 --> 00:10:31,089
I COULD SHOW YOU
A TRICK OR TWO

218
00:10:31,173 --> 00:10:32,841
FOR A PRICE.

219
00:10:32,925 --> 00:10:34,760
ANYTHING. NAME IT.

220
00:10:34,843 --> 00:10:37,429
$1200 DOLLARS,
TODAY.

221
00:10:37,513 --> 00:10:39,139
(CHUCKLING)
I'LL PASS.

222
00:10:39,223 --> 00:10:41,183
TOBY, I'M SERIOUS.

223
00:10:41,266 --> 00:10:42,392
OKAY, WELL,
GET THE MONEY BACK

224
00:10:42,476 --> 00:10:44,353
FROM YOUR LANDLORD.

225
00:10:44,436 --> 00:10:46,438
I ALREADY TRIED,
OKAY?

226
00:10:46,522 --> 00:10:48,690
IT'S NON-REFUNDABLE.

227
00:10:49,483 --> 00:10:51,777
LOOK, TO GET THE RENT MONEY,

228
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:55,864
I HAD TO DO SOMETHING - BAD.

229
00:10:57,991 --> 00:11:00,160
AND NOW I NEED TO UNDO IT,

230
00:11:02,204 --> 00:11:03,080
OR I'M IN TROUBLE.

231
00:11:03,163 --> 00:11:04,122
TOBY:
OKAY, FINE.

232
00:11:04,206 --> 00:11:07,751
BUT WHERE AM I SUPPOSED
TO GET $1200 TODAY?

233
00:11:07,835 --> 00:11:09,169
DON'T YOU HAVE BONDS
OR SOMETHING?

234
00:11:09,253 --> 00:11:10,963
(LAUGHS)
ARE YOU CRAZY?

235
00:11:11,046 --> 00:11:13,465
IF I TOUCH THOSE BONDS
MY MOM GOES BANANAS.

236
00:11:13,549 --> 00:11:15,634
JUST SCREW IT, OKAY?

237
00:11:15,717 --> 00:11:16,802
I NEED HELP!

238
00:11:16,885 --> 00:11:19,096
OF A MENTAL VARIETY.

239
00:11:19,179 --> 00:11:21,849
TOBY,
I'M ASKING YOU NICELY.

240
00:11:23,058 --> 00:11:24,309
I NEED THAT MONEY.

241
00:11:24,393 --> 00:11:26,687
JT, YOU NEED TO LET GO.

242
00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:27,729
NOW.

243
00:11:32,192 --> 00:11:33,485
SEE? THIS IS WHY
YOU HAVE NO FRIENDS.

244
00:11:33,569 --> 00:11:34,736
YOU KNOW WHAT?
GET AWAY FROM ME!

245
00:11:35,571 --> 00:11:36,905
STAY AWAY.

246
00:11:40,742 --> 00:11:42,077
SIMPSON:
HARD TO BELIEVE
THAT JACK IS ASLEEP

247
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:43,412
AND WE'RE ALL SITTING DOWN
TOGETHER, HUH?

248
00:11:43,495 --> 00:11:45,664
PLEASANT SURPRISE,
ACTUALLY.

249
00:11:45,747 --> 00:11:47,165
TALK ABOUT SURPRISES!

250
00:11:47,249 --> 00:11:49,293
WHAT ABOUT THE JAW-DROPPING
ARRIVAL

251
00:11:49,376 --> 00:11:51,211
YOUR HUBBY MADE
AT SCHOOL YESTERDAY?

252
00:11:51,295 --> 00:11:52,546
SPIKE:
EXCUSE ME?

253
00:11:52,629 --> 00:11:53,964
WHAT DID HE DO?

254
00:11:54,047 --> 00:11:56,425
POP A WHEELIE
ON HIS BICYCLE?

255
00:11:56,508 --> 00:11:57,342
YOU DIDN'T KNOW?

256
00:11:57,426 --> 00:11:58,927
EMMA? BEANS?

257
00:12:00,304 --> 00:12:01,722
DIDN'T KNOW WHAT?

258
00:12:02,598 --> 00:12:04,141
SOMEONE FILL ME IN HERE.

259
00:12:04,224 --> 00:12:05,726
OH UH...

260
00:12:06,935 --> 00:12:08,770
JOEY HAS A FRIEND
WHO'S SELLING A MOTORCYCLE.

261
00:12:10,272 --> 00:12:11,648
LOANED IT OUT TO ME
FOR A FEW DAYS

262
00:12:11,732 --> 00:12:13,233
TO TRY IT OUT.

263
00:12:13,317 --> 00:12:14,818
YOU'RE BUYING
A MOTORCYCLE?

264
00:12:14,902 --> 00:12:17,404
WITH WHAT -
COUCH TREASURE COINS?

265
00:12:17,487 --> 00:12:19,031
I WAS GOING
TO TALK TO YOU.

266
00:12:19,114 --> 00:12:20,949
YOU WILL.
LATER.

267
00:12:33,921 --> 00:12:35,714
I CUT YOU SOME SLACK,
STOCKBOY.

268
00:12:35,797 --> 00:12:37,424
BUT I'M RUNNING LOW
ON PATIENCE.

269
00:12:37,508 --> 00:12:39,009
WELL, THAT MAKES YOU
A PRETTY BAD DOCTOR THEN,

270
00:12:39,092 --> 00:12:39,593
DOESN'T IT?

271
00:12:39,676 --> 00:12:40,928
HA HA.
SPEAKING OF DOCTORS,

272
00:12:41,011 --> 00:12:42,804
AARON IS CONSIDERING
SENDING YOU TO ONE.

273
00:12:42,888 --> 00:12:45,098
SO YOU MIGHT WANNA
QUIT WITH THE JOKES.

274
00:12:47,184 --> 00:12:48,560
I GAVE YOU AN ADVANCE.

275
00:12:48,644 --> 00:12:50,020
WHICH I NEVER SHOULD
HAVE ASKED FOR, OKAY?

276
00:12:50,103 --> 00:12:51,772
I'M GONNA GET YOU
ALL OF YOUR MONEY BACK.

277
00:12:51,855 --> 00:12:52,814
REALLY?

278
00:12:52,898 --> 00:12:54,733
YEAH, BUT I JUST NEED YOU
TO GIVE ME THE DRUGS BACK -

279
00:12:54,816 --> 00:12:55,567
ASAP -

280
00:12:55,651 --> 00:12:57,819
SO THAT I CAN GIVE THEM BACK
TO THE PHARMACY.

281
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:03,534
(NERVOUS LAUGH)
DUDE, DON'T.

282
00:13:13,210 --> 00:13:15,420
THAT'S IN CASE
YOU DIDN'T KNOW...

283
00:13:15,504 --> 00:13:17,464
I RUN THE SHOW.

284
00:13:17,548 --> 00:13:19,758
AND I DON'T WANT
MY MONEY BACK.

285
00:13:19,842 --> 00:13:21,927
I WANT MORE DRUGS.

286
00:13:23,011 --> 00:13:24,388
I'LL GO TO THE COPS.

287
00:13:24,471 --> 00:13:25,430
AND WHAT?

288
00:13:25,514 --> 00:13:26,890
WHAT, YOU GONNA GET YOURSELF
THROWN IN JAIL

289
00:13:26,974 --> 00:13:28,433
FOR STEALING DRUGS?

290
00:13:28,517 --> 00:13:30,686
THAT'S A SMART MOVE.

291
00:13:35,691 --> 00:13:37,776
JT, JUST GET THE MAN
WHAT HE WANTS.

292
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:40,195
THIS WILL ALL BE OVER.

293
00:13:59,381 --> 00:14:02,009
MR. MCKAY:
HEY! COME BACK HERE!

294
00:14:17,524 --> 00:14:19,151
JT, CALL SECURITY.

295
00:14:19,234 --> 00:14:20,652
I CAUGHT THIS SHOPLIFTER
RED-HANDED.

296
00:14:20,736 --> 00:14:22,154
YEAH, SURE.
SURE THING.

297
00:14:39,838 --> 00:14:41,381
HOW WORRIED
SHOULD I BE?

298
00:14:41,465 --> 00:14:42,841
I'LL DRIVE CAREFULLY.

299
00:14:42,925 --> 00:14:44,343
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.

300
00:14:44,426 --> 00:14:47,054
IS THIS THE START
OF YOUR MIDLIFE CRISIS?

301
00:14:47,137 --> 00:14:48,514
AH, "THE TALK".

302
00:14:48,597 --> 00:14:50,557
SPIKE, IT IS A MEANS
OF TRANSPORTATION.

303
00:14:50,641 --> 00:14:51,683
IT DOESN'T MEAN ANYTHING.

304
00:14:51,767 --> 00:14:53,769
THEN WHY ALL THE CLOAK
AND DAGGER?

305
00:14:53,852 --> 00:14:54,895
LOOK, DAY IN, DAY OUT,

306
00:14:54,978 --> 00:14:56,438
I'M MR. STRAIGHT
AND NARROW, OKAY?

307
00:14:56,522 --> 00:14:58,649
IT'S WORK, FAMILY.
WORK, FAMILY.

308
00:14:58,732 --> 00:15:01,276
IT'S JUST SO PREDICTABLE,
HUH?

309
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,904
SORRY IF WE'RE CRAMPING
YOUR STYLE.

310
00:15:03,987 --> 00:15:06,532
HEY, I'M HAPPY TO MAKE
SACRIFICES FOR YOU

311
00:15:06,615 --> 00:15:07,991
AND FOR THE KIDS,

312
00:15:09,326 --> 00:15:12,829
THERE HAS TO BE MORE TO LIFE
THAN ROUTINE.

313
00:15:16,166 --> 00:15:18,710
TELL ME WE HAVE NOTHING
TO WORRY ABOUT.

314
00:15:18,794 --> 00:15:20,629
I WISH I COULD.

315
00:15:20,712 --> 00:15:21,672
WE'LL GO TO MY PARENTS.

316
00:15:21,755 --> 00:15:23,298
WE'LL GET THEIR HELP.
MY DAD'S A LAWYER.

317
00:15:23,382 --> 00:15:24,508
I DON'T NEED A LAWYER.

318
00:15:24,591 --> 00:15:25,342
I NEED A SUPERHERO

319
00:15:25,425 --> 00:15:27,553
TO KEEP A DRUG DEALER
FROM KILLING ME.

320
00:15:27,636 --> 00:15:29,263
WHAT DRUG DEALER?

321
00:15:29,346 --> 00:15:32,391
THE GENTLEMAN WHO FINANCED
OUR APARTMENT.

322
00:15:32,474 --> 00:15:33,600
HE MADE ME STEAL AGAIN.

323
00:15:33,684 --> 00:15:34,685
AGAIN?

324
00:15:35,644 --> 00:15:38,063
BUT MR. MCKAY WAS
ALREADY SUSPICIOUS!

325
00:15:38,146 --> 00:15:39,565
HE'LL CATCH YOU!

326
00:15:39,648 --> 00:15:41,316
MAYBE NOT, OKAY?

327
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:43,485
MAYBE MR. MCKAY
WON'T NOTICE.

328
00:15:43,569 --> 00:15:46,196
AND MAYBE I'LL TOTALLY
GET AWAY WITH IT.

329
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:49,032
AND MAYBE WE'LL BE FINE.

330
00:15:49,116 --> 00:15:50,993
I THOUGHT
YOU'D CHANGED.

331
00:15:51,076 --> 00:15:52,661
I THOUGHT
YOU'D GROWN UP.

332
00:15:52,744 --> 00:15:54,496
LIBERTY,
I HAVE CHANGED.

333
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:55,789
YEAH.

334
00:15:55,873 --> 00:15:58,500
NOW YOU'RE A DRUG DEALER.

335
00:16:08,135 --> 00:16:08,844
JT:
HERE.

336
00:16:10,554 --> 00:16:13,223
NOW GO RUIN SOMEONE
ELSE'S LIFE.

337
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,437
WHAT?!
ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND!

338
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:19,104
HUH?!

339
00:16:19,188 --> 00:16:20,814
HEY, EASY.
EASY.

340
00:16:20,898 --> 00:16:22,232
I GOT HIM.
EASY.

341
00:16:23,275 --> 00:16:24,109
I GOT HIM!

342
00:16:26,987 --> 00:16:29,114
YOU GOT ME INTO THIS.

343
00:16:29,198 --> 00:16:30,991
YEAH, AND I JUST
SAVED YOUR BUTT.

344
00:16:31,074 --> 00:16:32,326
OR WERE YOU TWO GUYS
GOING TO KISS?

345
00:16:32,409 --> 00:16:33,452
NOT THAT IT'S ANY
OF MY BUSINESS

346
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:34,953
WHAT TEAM YOU PLAY FOR.

347
00:16:35,037 --> 00:16:37,748
JUST ASK THE GIRL
WHO'S CARRYING MY KID.

348
00:16:37,831 --> 00:16:40,334
UH-OH.
BUN IN THE OVEN.

349
00:16:40,417 --> 00:16:41,376
YEAH.

350
00:16:42,461 --> 00:16:44,630
AND THANKS TO THESE,

351
00:16:46,507 --> 00:16:48,342
I'M DEAD TO HER.

352
00:16:48,842 --> 00:16:51,011
COME ON, MAN.
IT'LL BE OKAY.

353
00:16:51,094 --> 00:16:52,596
IT'S OKAY?

354
00:16:52,679 --> 00:16:54,348
I LOST MY GIRL.

355
00:16:54,431 --> 00:16:56,350
I LOST MY BEST FRIEND.

356
00:16:56,433 --> 00:16:59,311
I LOST MY JOB
AND MY FAMILY.

357
00:16:59,394 --> 00:17:01,647
AND NOW I'M PROBABLY
GOING TO JAIL.

358
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:03,732
HEY, BUMMER TIMES.

359
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:07,236
LEAST THERE'S A PARTY.

360
00:17:34,346 --> 00:17:36,390
WORKING LATE AGAIN?

361
00:17:36,473 --> 00:17:37,516
NOT RIDING THAT BIKE
OUTSIDE,

362
00:17:37,599 --> 00:17:41,353
ENJOYING THE LAST RAYS
OF SUNSHINE?

363
00:17:41,436 --> 00:17:42,437
I'M GIVING IT BACK.

364
00:17:43,856 --> 00:17:45,232
IT'S THAT OR THE WIFE.

365
00:17:45,315 --> 00:17:46,191
MMM...

366
00:17:46,275 --> 00:17:48,318
MY EX HAD A CHOICE ONCE:

367
00:17:48,402 --> 00:17:50,320
ME OR THE INTERN.

368
00:17:52,489 --> 00:17:55,701
SOME PEOPLE
MAKE YOU WONDER, HUH?

369
00:17:56,743 --> 00:17:58,537
TOO BAD ABOUT THE BIKE.

370
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:01,081
IT REMINDS ME OF THE ONE
I USED TO OWN.

371
00:18:01,164 --> 00:18:01,498
WOW.

372
00:18:03,792 --> 00:18:05,043
TRYING TO WRAP MY HEAD
AROUND THE IDEA

373
00:18:05,127 --> 00:18:07,045
OF YOU ON A SPORT BIKE.

374
00:18:08,172 --> 00:18:10,591
WHY IS THAT SO HARD
TO FIGURE?

375
00:18:10,674 --> 00:18:12,342
BECAUSE I'M A WOMAN?

376
00:18:12,843 --> 00:18:14,803
BECAUSE YOU'RE MY PRINCIPAL.

377
00:18:14,887 --> 00:18:18,307
WELL, I USED TO BE
A WILD CHILD IN MY DAY.

378
00:18:18,390 --> 00:18:20,267
A LOT HAS CHANGED.

379
00:18:20,350 --> 00:18:22,686
BUT I STILL LOVE MOTORCYLES.

380
00:18:23,645 --> 00:18:25,230
AS A MATTER OF FACT...

381
00:18:25,314 --> 00:18:27,900
I WAS GONNA ASK YOU
FOR A RIDE.

382
00:18:37,784 --> 00:18:39,494
(MUSIC PLAYS)

383
00:18:39,578 --> 00:18:41,663

AARON:
HEY CONGRATS, STUD.

387
00:18:53,467 --> 00:18:54,843
THIS ONE'S ON ME.

388
00:19:01,558 --> 00:19:02,392
(LAUGHING)

389
00:19:03,268 --> 00:19:05,020
ACTUALLY, IT'S ON ME.

390
00:19:13,654 --> 00:19:14,488

391
00:19:24,873 --> 00:19:26,542

HEY. HEY BUDDY!

392
00:19:27,376 --> 00:19:27,709

394
00:19:31,088 --> 00:19:32,840
SOMEBODY GET THE CAR!

395
00:19:38,929 --> 00:19:40,347
HE'S FAST,
HE'S FURIOUS,

396
00:19:40,430 --> 00:19:42,933
HE'S COVERED
IN KEVLAR!

397
00:19:45,269 --> 00:19:45,769
HEY SNAKE.

398
00:19:45,853 --> 00:19:47,855
GOOD MORNING,
JOEY.

399
00:19:49,731 --> 00:19:51,191
I GOING TO NEED TO TALK
TO THAT FRIEND OF YOURS;

400
00:19:51,275 --> 00:19:53,694
ITS RIGHTFUL OWNER.

401
00:19:53,777 --> 00:19:55,487
OH, DON'T YOU WANT TO SEE
HOW THE COOL-ECTOMY GOES

402
00:19:55,571 --> 00:19:56,905
BEFORE YOU GIVE
THE SUIT BACK?

403
00:19:58,115 --> 00:19:59,783
THAT WON'T BE NECESSARY.

404
00:19:59,867 --> 00:20:00,951
THIS IS FOR THE KEVLAR

405
00:20:01,034 --> 00:20:03,620
AND THE WHEELS
THAT GO WITH IT.

406
00:20:04,746 --> 00:20:05,247
SNAKE...

407
00:20:07,124 --> 00:20:08,458
THIS IS EXACTLY
WHAT YOU NEED.

408
00:20:14,006 --> 00:20:16,175
MR. VAN ZANDT:
I SPOKE TO MR. MCKAY.

409
00:20:16,258 --> 00:20:18,677
TRIED TO EXPLAIN
THE SITUATION.

410
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:20,762
WE'RE GOING TO TRY
TO WORK OUT A DEAL.

411
00:20:20,846 --> 00:20:23,599

412
00:20:23,682 --> 00:20:25,184

IT'S NO JOKE.

420
00:20:54,004 --> 00:20:57,424
WELL, I'M GLAD
YOU'RE GETTING HELP.

421
00:20:58,467 --> 00:21:01,720

(CRYING)

423
00:21:04,973 --> 00:21:06,266
WHAT WERE YOU THINKING?

424
00:21:06,350 --> 00:21:08,602
LEAVING ME ALONE
WITH ALL THIS?

425
00:21:08,685 --> 00:21:10,020
