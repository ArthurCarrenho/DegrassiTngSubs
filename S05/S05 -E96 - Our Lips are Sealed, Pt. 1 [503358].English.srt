AND EVERY MEAL
AFTER THAT.

5
00:00:09,843 --> 00:00:11,011
WE COUNT ON YOU, EM.

6
00:00:11,094 --> 00:00:12,638
I COUNT ON YOU.

7
00:00:12,721 --> 00:00:14,640

HOW NICE FOR HIM.

17
00:00:33,617 --> 00:00:35,202
NO WONDER I'VE GAINED

TELL ME ABOUT IT.

19
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:38,997
I HAVE A MEETING WITH
BERNICE FEIN ON FRIDAY

20
00:00:39,081 --> 00:00:41,834
AND I CAN'T EVEN FIT
INTO MY LUCKY JEANS.

21
00:00:41,917 --> 00:00:43,043
"DUMP THE LUMPS"
BERNICE FEIN?

22
00:00:43,126 --> 00:00:44,169
AS IN THE AGENT FROM HELL?

23
00:00:44,795 --> 00:00:45,879
(SIGHS) IF SHE'S SATAN,

24
00:00:45,963 --> 00:00:49,174
THEN THAT EXPLAINS WHY
SHE'S THE BEST AGENT IN TOWN.

25
00:00:49,258 --> 00:00:51,802
SHE CALLED BECAUSE SHE SAW ME
IN THE KEVIN SMITH MOVIE,

26
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:54,763
WANTS TO AUDITION ME AGAIN.
(GRUNT OF EFFORT)

29
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:00,811
"CRISIS" IS ACTUALLY
AN EPIDEMIC.

CELERY HAS NEGATIVE CALORIES

69
00:02:56,218 --> 00:02:59,096

EMMA'S OOEY-GOOEY
FAVOURITE.

180
00:07:58,103 --> 00:07:59,354
ACTUALLY UM,

181
00:07:59,438 --> 00:08:01,148
MANNY AND I ARE GONNA GO
FOR A WALK.

182
00:08:01,231 --> 00:08:02,065
NO, GIRLS,

183
00:08:02,983 --> 00:08:03,901
STAY.

184
00:08:04,526 --> 00:08:07,696
WHY DON'T YOU TWO
SET THE TABLE.

185
00:08:17,748 --> 00:08:19,666
(SNIFFS)
OH MY GOD, RICOTTA!

186
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:21,001
CREAM AND BUTTER
AND EVERYTHING ELSE

187
00:08:21,084 --> 00:08:22,544
THAT I SEE IN MY DREAMS.

188
00:08:22,628 --> 00:08:23,587
WE HAVEN'T STARVED
FOR TWO DAYS

189
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:25,589
JUST TO RUIN IT IN
10 MINUTES OF GLUTTONY.

190
00:08:25,672 --> 00:08:27,132
SO WHAT DO WE DO?

191
00:08:27,216 --> 00:08:29,218
WE SIT AT THE TABLE
WITH MOM AND ARCHIE

192
00:08:29,301 --> 00:08:30,052
AND TRY TO MAKE THEM HAPPY.

193
00:08:30,135 --> 00:08:31,762
AND THE FOOD WE JUST PUSH
AROUND YOUR PLATES.

194
00:08:33,639 --> 00:08:34,723
(WATER DRIPS)

195
00:08:43,899 --> 00:08:47,069
KITCHEN FAUCET'S
STILL LEAKING, HUH?

196
00:08:47,152 --> 00:08:48,654
I SHOULD GET MY WRENCH
AND UH...

197
00:08:48,737 --> 00:08:50,739
IT'S FINE,
ARCHIE.

198
00:08:53,742 --> 00:08:54,576
DO YOU KNOW HOW MUCH WATER
YOU'RE WASTING?

199
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:55,702
MY WRENCH IS DOWNSTAIRS-

200
00:08:55,786 --> 00:08:57,621
JUST LEAVE IT!
PLEASE.

201
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:03,377
THIS MOUSSAKA
IS AMAZING.

202
00:09:06,964 --> 00:09:08,507
EMMA, I HAVEN'T SEEN YOU
TOUCH YOURS.

203
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:10,092
EMMA:
SURE I HAVE.

204
00:09:10,175 --> 00:09:13,470
YOUR COOKING IS SOMETHING
WE'VE REALLY MISSED AROUND HERE.

205
00:09:13,554 --> 00:09:17,015
SIMPSON:
WELL, I MISS COOKING
FOR YOU GUYS.

206
00:09:17,099 --> 00:09:19,017
I MISS A LOT OF THINGS.

207
00:09:21,478 --> 00:09:23,188
SITTING HERE AT THIS TABLE,

208
00:09:23,272 --> 00:09:26,358
I REALIZE THAT
THIS IS WHERE I BELONG,

209
00:09:26,441 --> 00:09:28,277
AND I NEVER SHOULD'VE LEFT.

210
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:30,028
YOU DIDN'T LEAVE,
SNAKE.

211
00:09:30,112 --> 00:09:31,321
I KICKED YOU OUT.

212
00:09:32,239 --> 00:09:33,490
REMEMBER?

213
00:09:36,201 --> 00:09:38,704
IT'S BEEN LONG ENOUGH, SPIKE.
AND I...

214
00:09:38,787 --> 00:09:39,705
I THINK I'VE LEARNED
MY LESSON.

215
00:09:40,706 --> 00:09:41,915
I'M READY TO COME HOME.

216
00:09:41,999 --> 00:09:43,792
OH, AND THAT'S
YOUR DECISION TO MAKE?

217
00:09:43,876 --> 00:09:45,002
SIMPSON:
NO, IT'S OUR DECISION

218
00:09:45,085 --> 00:09:46,086
BUT YES,
I HAVE A SAY IN IT.

219
00:09:46,170 --> 00:09:47,504
YOU HAD YOUR SAY

220
00:09:47,588 --> 00:09:50,090
AND IT INVOLVED
ANOTHER WOMAN!

221
00:09:51,466 --> 00:09:52,509
GIRLS...

222
00:09:52,593 --> 00:09:54,011
I THINK YOU NEED
TO GO TO YOUR ROOM.

223
00:10:03,187 --> 00:10:04,771
SIMPSON:
SPIKE, I CAME OVER HERE
WITH A PEACE OFFERING

224
00:10:04,855 --> 00:10:05,939
AND THIS IS WHAT I GET.

225
00:10:06,023 --> 00:10:07,232
SPIKE:
YOU THINK A PAN OF MOUSSAKA

226
00:10:07,316 --> 00:10:08,775
IS GONNA MAKE EVERYTHING
BETTER?!

227
00:10:08,859 --> 00:10:09,610
SIMPSON:
NO, I DON'T!

228
00:10:09,693 --> 00:10:11,320
I THOUGHT MAYBE WE COULD TRY
TO BE CIVILIZED-

229
00:10:11,403 --> 00:10:14,072
FIGHTING.
ONLY FIGHTING.

230
00:10:14,156 --> 00:10:16,283
FIGHTING'S A START,
RIGHT?

231
00:10:16,366 --> 00:10:18,577
IT'S BETTER THAN
NOT TALKING AT ALL.

232
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:19,119
I GUESS.

233
00:10:19,203 --> 00:10:20,204
SPIKE:
FINE! GET OUT OF MY HOUSE!

234
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:20,954
I JUST WISH I KNEW

235
00:10:21,038 --> 00:10:21,788
HOW IT WAS GONNA
TURN OUT.

236
00:10:21,872 --> 00:10:23,624
I HATE NOT KNOWING
WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN.

237
00:10:23,707 --> 00:10:24,416
(DOOR SLAMS SHUT)

238
00:10:24,499 --> 00:10:26,210
I'LL TELL YOU
WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN.

239
00:10:26,293 --> 00:10:27,711
I AM GOING TO EXPLODE

240
00:10:27,794 --> 00:10:30,422
FROM ALL THAT OOEY-GOOEY
MOUSSAKEEY.

241
00:10:30,506 --> 00:10:31,840
I WISH I WOULD EXPLODE.

242
00:10:32,883 --> 00:10:33,926
WE COULD TRY AND RUN IT OFF.

243
00:10:34,009 --> 00:10:36,136
IT'LL ONLY TAKE
OH, SIX HOURS.

244
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:38,222
IF I MOVE,
I'LL BARF.

245
00:10:38,305 --> 00:10:40,349
IT CAN'T BE HEALTHY
TO BE THIS FULL.

246
00:10:41,767 --> 00:10:43,101
WE COULD GET RID OF IT.

247
00:10:43,185 --> 00:10:44,561
LIKE HOW, PUKING?

248
00:10:45,103 --> 00:10:46,647
ISN'T THAT KIND
OF EXTREME?

249
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:49,024
DESPERATE TIMES
CALL FOR DESPERATE PURGING.

250
00:10:49,107 --> 00:10:49,983
MANNY;
IT'S NOT CALLED PURGING,

251
00:10:50,067 --> 00:10:51,985
IT'S CALLED BULIMIA.

252
00:10:52,069 --> 00:10:53,820
DON'T BE SO DRAMATIC.

253
00:10:53,904 --> 00:10:56,448
THESE ARE SPECIAL
CIRCUMSTANCES.

254
00:10:56,532 --> 00:10:58,742
YOU'LL FEEL BETTER, MANNY.
COME ON.

255
00:10:58,825 --> 00:10:59,493
COME ON.

256
00:11:22,933 --> 00:11:24,476
(ANXIOUS SIGH)

257
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,353
NOW FOR THE MOMENT
OF TRUTH.

258
00:11:26,436 --> 00:11:28,063
MANNY:
COULD I GO TO THE BATHROOM
FIRST?

259
00:11:28,146 --> 00:11:31,108
THAT'S GOTTA BE HALF A POUND.

260
00:11:38,365 --> 00:11:39,783
(GASPS)

261
00:11:39,867 --> 00:11:42,411
EM, I LOST THREE POUNDS!

262
00:11:42,494 --> 00:11:45,163
THREE POUNDS
IN FOUR DAYS!

263
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:49,918
(CHUCKLING)

264
00:11:50,002 --> 00:11:51,461
I LOST THREE,
THREE, THRE-

265
00:11:51,545 --> 00:11:53,172
FOUR... POUNDS.

266
00:11:54,548 --> 00:11:56,592
I LOST FOUR POUNDS?!

267
00:11:56,675 --> 00:11:59,178
EM, YOU ARE OFFICIALLY
MY LIFESTYLE GURU.

268
00:11:59,261 --> 00:12:01,013
LIKE BOB ON OPRAH!

269
00:12:01,096 --> 00:12:03,015
OKAY, SO IF WE RESTRAIN
OURSELVES TODAY

270
00:12:03,098 --> 00:12:03,891
AND WORK OUT AFTER SCHOOL,

271
00:12:03,974 --> 00:12:06,101
WE MIGHT BE UP TO FIVE POUNDS
BY TOMORROW.

272
00:12:06,185 --> 00:12:07,352
AH, NO-NO-NO.

273
00:12:07,436 --> 00:12:08,604
THERE'S A BUTTER TART
IN THE CAF

274
00:12:08,687 --> 00:12:09,771
WITH MY NAME ON IT.

275
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:10,939
MANNY, NO.

276
00:12:11,023 --> 00:12:12,357
IF WE'RE HAPPY
WITH LESS THAN OUR GOAL,

277
00:12:12,441 --> 00:12:14,735
WE'RE ONLY DISAPPOINTING
OURSELVES.

278
00:12:14,818 --> 00:12:16,737
YOU'VE GOT AN AGENT
TO IMPRESS.

279
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:18,614
THIS IS SERIOUS.

280
00:12:18,697 --> 00:12:20,032
OKAY, BOB.

281

284
00:13:09,706 --> 00:13:12,209
JOEY:
OKAY, I GOT IT.

285
00:13:12,292 --> 00:13:14,044
CHANGE HER OIL.

286
00:13:14,878 --> 00:13:16,839
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

287
00:13:16,922 --> 00:13:18,465
YOU REALLY THINK DOING
AN OIL CHANGE ON SPIKE'S CAR

288
00:13:18,549 --> 00:13:20,342
IS GOING TO WIN
HER BACK?

289
00:13:20,384 --> 00:13:21,760
SNAKE, I'M SPIT-BALLING
HERE, OKAY?

290
00:13:21,844 --> 00:13:24,096
WORK WITH ME,
BUDDY.

291
00:13:24,179 --> 00:13:25,347
OKAY UH...

292
00:13:26,765 --> 00:13:28,141
THE ROOF'S A MESS.

293
00:13:28,225 --> 00:13:30,185
I COULD HELP REDO IT.

294
00:13:30,269 --> 00:13:32,563
YES! AND YOU CAN GET
ALL HOT AND SWEATY

295
00:13:32,646 --> 00:13:33,355
WHILE YOU'RE DOING IT.

296
00:13:33,438 --> 00:13:35,232
CHICKS DIG THAT!

297
00:13:35,315 --> 00:13:36,149

SNAKE THE SEXY ROOFER!
I LIKE IT!

299
00:13:38,443 --> 00:13:40,362
DIANE:
(EXASPERATED GASP)
COME ON!

300
00:13:40,445 --> 00:13:44,449
WOMEN DON'T WANT AN EPISODE
OF "THIS OLD HOUSE".

301
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,702
THEY WANT A LITTLE ROMANCE.

302
00:13:46,785 --> 00:13:50,122
THEY WANT TO KNOW
THEY'RE SPECIAL.

303
00:13:51,081 --> 00:13:52,666
SPIKE IS SPECIAL TO YOU,
RIGHT?

304
00:13:54,293 --> 00:13:55,794
SO PROVE IT.

305
00:13:56,670 --> 00:13:57,838
SHOW HER WHAT'S
IN YOUR HEART.

306
00:13:59,089 --> 00:14:00,090
I DON'T KNOW THAT SPIKE'S
THAT INTERESTED

307
00:14:00,174 --> 00:14:01,842
WHAT'S IN MY HEART,
RIGHT NOW.

308
00:14:01,925 --> 00:14:03,302
DIANE:
SHE WILL BE.

309
00:14:03,385 --> 00:14:04,386
TRUST ME.

310
00:14:04,469 --> 00:14:07,055
JUST REMIND HER WHY
SHE FELL IN LOVE WITH YOU

311
00:14:07,139 --> 00:14:08,765
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

312
00:14:10,684 --> 00:14:11,351
WOO HER.

313
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:27,784
PLEASE STOP SAYING MY NAME.

314
00:14:28,702 --> 00:14:30,662
(LOUD WHISPER)
STOP!

(EXHALES)
MANNY...

317
00:14:50,682 --> 00:14:51,808
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

318
00:14:51,892 --> 00:14:53,894
UM, A LITTLE KNOWN FACT

319
00:14:53,977 --> 00:14:57,356
IS THAT PEPPERONI SQUELCHES
AUDITION STRESS.

320
00:14:57,439 --> 00:14:59,149
THAT'S A LIE.

321
00:14:59,233 --> 00:15:00,317
OKAY...

322
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:03,320
I'M JUST PLAIN
NAKED HUNGRY!

323
00:15:03,403 --> 00:15:05,447
HUNGER IS A FEELING,
MANNY.

324
00:15:05,531 --> 00:15:07,699
THIN IS A SKILL.

325
00:15:07,783 --> 00:15:09,952

NO!

328
00:15:16,875 --> 00:15:17,626
I'LL COVER FOR YOU.

329
00:15:17,709 --> 00:15:19,545
MY JEANS STILL FIT,
GENERAL.

330
00:15:19,628 --> 00:15:22,172
MANNY, YOUR BODY
IS A REFLECTION OF YOU.

331
00:15:22,256 --> 00:15:24,258
THE AGENT IS GOING TO SEE
THAT YOU'RE UNDISCIPLINED.

332
00:15:24,341 --> 00:15:26,176
THE AGENT'S GOING TO SEE
THAT I HAVE ENERGY

333
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:26,969
AND ROSY CHEEKS,

334
00:15:27,052 --> 00:15:28,470
AND THAT I DON'T
HAVE PUKE BREATH.

335
00:15:28,554 --> 00:15:30,430
THIS IS SO
"TYPICAL MANNY".

336
00:15:30,514 --> 00:15:31,682
GIVE UP WHEN THE GOING
GETS TOUGH.

337
00:15:31,765 --> 00:15:33,350
IT'S ONE SLICE OF PIZZA,
EM!

338
00:15:33,433 --> 00:15:35,978
IT'S FAT AND STARCH
AND GREASE.

339
00:15:36,061 --> 00:15:37,980
WHY NOT JUST POUR POISON
DOWN YOUR THROAT?!

340
00:15:38,063 --> 00:15:40,107
(DRY CHUCKLE)
OKAY.

341
00:15:40,649 --> 00:15:42,860
THERE IS JUST A LITTLE
TOO MUCH CRAZY IN HERE.

342
00:15:53,912 --> 00:15:54,872

00:15:56,623 --> 00:15:58,166

WHAT'S GOING ON?

344
00:15:58,250 --> 00:16:00,586
SOMEONE GET A TEACHER.

345
00:16:01,587 --> 00:16:03,505

EMMA?

346
00:16:04,214 --> 00:16:06,049
CAN YOU HEAR ME?

347
00:16:07,342 --> 00:16:07,843
EMMA?!

348
00:16:14,183 --> 00:16:16,894
MAYBE YOU SHOULD
JUST SIT STILL.

349
00:16:16,977 --> 00:16:19,188
NO, I'M JUST DIZZY,
I THINK.

350
00:16:19,271 --> 00:16:21,106
I THINK IT'S THE FLU
OR SOMETHING.

351
00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:23,108
WHOA! WHOA! WHOA!

352
00:16:26,403 --> 00:16:27,863
DID YOU EAT TODAY?

353
00:16:27,946 --> 00:16:29,114
YES!

354
00:16:29,198 --> 00:16:31,617
WHAT DID YOU EAT,
EMMA?

355
00:16:32,117 --> 00:16:33,076
EMMA...

356
00:16:34,036 --> 00:16:37,331
IT'S OKAY,
YOU CAN TALK TO ME.

357
00:16:37,414 --> 00:16:39,333
I'M HERE FOR YOU.

358
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:41,835
THAT'S FUNNY.

359
00:16:42,544 --> 00:16:43,295
(EXHALES)

360
00:16:53,639 --> 00:16:55,390
(IRRITATED SIGH)

361
00:17:01,146 --> 00:17:03,315
THE GIRLS AT THE SALON
TOLD ME YOU WERE ON BREAK.

362
00:17:03,398 --> 00:17:06,026
ARE YOU SELLING ROSES
IN RESTAURANTS?

363
00:17:06,109 --> 00:17:08,070
WHAT'S WITH
THE PENGUIN SUIT?

364
00:17:08,153 --> 00:17:11,907
I WAS WEARING A T-SHIRT
ON OUR WEDDING DAY.

365
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:16,036
AND I WANTED TO MAKE SURE
I DID THIS RIGHT.

366
00:17:16,119 --> 00:17:19,039
SPIKE,
YOU ARE MY EVERYTHING.

367
00:17:20,541 --> 00:17:21,124
AND IF YOU LET ME
COME HOME

368
00:17:21,208 --> 00:17:22,709
I'LL BE WORTHY OF YOU
THIS TIME

369
00:17:22,793 --> 00:17:25,838
BECAUSE YOU DESERVE
EVERYTHING.

370
00:17:27,089 --> 00:17:29,007
YOU'RE BEAUTIFUL.

371
00:17:34,137 --> 00:17:35,180
YOU HURT ME.

372
00:17:35,264 --> 00:17:35,806
I KNOW.

373
00:17:35,889 --> 00:17:38,559
NO.
YOU DON'T REALLY KNOW.

374
00:17:40,185 --> 00:17:43,355
I LOVED YOU
SINCE I WAS SIXTEEN.

375
00:17:44,606 --> 00:17:48,277
YOU WERE THE ONE GUY
I THOUGHT WAS GOOD,

376
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:50,946
THE ONE GUY I WAS SURE
I COULD COUNT ON.

377
00:17:53,115 --> 00:17:54,867
COUNT ON ME NOW...

378
00:17:56,326 --> 00:17:58,370
BECAUSE I LOVE YOU.

379
00:17:59,079 --> 00:18:03,750
BECAUSE I'LL NEVER GIVE UP
UNTIL YOU TAKE ME BACK.

380
00:18:08,714 --> 00:18:09,673

390

DONE.

391
00:18:47,211 --> 00:18:49,922
NO KISSING ANYONE
BUT ME -

392
00:18:50,005 --> 00:18:51,423
EVER AGAIN!

393
00:18:54,259 --> 00:18:57,095
AND NO SINGING
EVER AGAIN.

394
00:19:00,057 --> 00:19:00,891
(APPLAUSE)

395
00:19:19,785 --> 00:19:20,869
HOW'D THE AUDITION GO?

396
00:19:20,953 --> 00:19:23,163
SHE SAID I HAD "MOXIE".

397
00:19:23,247 --> 00:19:23,956
WHICH MEANS...?

398
00:19:24,039 --> 00:19:24,957
I HAVE AN AGENT!

399
00:19:26,208 --> 00:19:28,210
I'M SO HAPPY FOR YOU.

400
00:19:28,293 --> 00:19:31,171
AND I'M SO WORRIED
ABOUT YOU.

401
00:19:31,255 --> 00:19:33,340
I HEARD YOU FAINTED.

402
00:19:33,423 --> 00:19:36,718
AND THESE DISMEMBERED
MODELS ARE DISTURBING.

403
00:19:36,802 --> 00:19:38,011
IT'S INSPIRATION.

404
00:19:38,095 --> 00:19:39,513
FOR WHEN I WANT TO LOSE
A POUND.

405
00:19:39,596 --> 00:19:42,391
OKAY, BUT YOU'VE LOST,
LIKE, SEVEN.

406
00:19:42,474 --> 00:19:44,601
YOU'RE STARTING
TO SCARE ME.

407
00:19:44,685 --> 00:19:45,769
I'M GROSS, MANNY.

408
00:19:45,853 --> 00:19:46,687
I LOOK DISGUSTING.

409
00:19:46,770 --> 00:19:48,522
WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME
YOU ATE?

410
00:19:49,815 --> 00:19:51,316
A COUPLE DAYS AGO.

411
00:19:52,734 --> 00:19:54,069
I FEEL GOOD.

412
00:19:54,152 --> 00:19:55,654
BUT YOU LOOK SICK.

413
00:19:56,321 --> 00:19:58,365
AND THE WAY YOU'RE TALKING,
YOU MIGHT BE SICK.

414
00:20:00,993 --> 00:20:05,664
OKAY. SNAKE'S BRINGING HIS
SPECIAL LASAGNA OVER TONIGHT.

415
00:20:07,207 --> 00:20:07,958
I'LL EAT SOME.

416
00:20:08,709 --> 00:20:10,127
HE'S COMING BACK?

417
00:20:10,836 --> 00:20:12,337
THAT'S THE JUICE.

418
00:20:12,421 --> 00:20:14,298
AND I'M ALL OVER
THAT LASAGNA.

419
00:20:16,008 --> 00:20:18,343
MAY THIS DIET
REST IN PEACE.

420
00:20:20,762 --> 00:20:21,763
MANNY:
GOOD.

421
00:20:21,847 --> 00:20:23,891
BECAUSE I NEED YOU HEALTHY,
EMMA.

422
00:20:23,974 --> 00:20:26,810
YOU'RE MORE THAN JUST
MY LIFESTYLE GURU, YOU KNOW.

423
00:20:33,108 --> 00:20:34,234
ALL:
(LAUGHING)

424
00:20:34,318 --> 00:20:36,445
HEY, EVERYONE, CHEERS.

425
00:20:36,528 --> 00:20:37,946
YOU ARE AN AMAZING
FAMILY.

426
00:20:38,030 --> 00:20:39,031
ALL:
CHEERS!

427
00:20:40,824 --> 00:20:41,283
OOP!

428
00:20:41,366 --> 00:20:42,701
OH W-W-W-WAIT!
ACTUALLY,

429
00:20:42,784 --> 00:20:43,952
I HAVE AN ANNOUNCEMENT.

430
00:20:44,036 --> 00:20:45,537
EMMA:
ARE YOU GUYS GONNA FINALLY
STOP CALLING EACH OTHER

431
00:20:45,621 --> 00:20:46,496
BY YOUR HIGH SCHOOL
NICKNAMES?

432
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:47,331
MANNY:
(CHUCKLES)

433
00:20:47,414 --> 00:20:49,166
NOT A BAD IDEA,
BUT NO.

434
00:20:49,249 --> 00:20:50,459
UH, AS YOU ALL KNOW,

435
00:20:50,542 --> 00:20:52,127
I STILL HAVE
A MOTORCYCLE FUND.

436
00:20:52,211 --> 00:20:53,045
WHICH I WOULD LIKE TO USE

437
00:20:53,128 --> 00:20:55,214
NOT TO BUY
ANOTHER MOTORCYCLE WITH,

438
00:20:55,297 --> 00:20:56,632
BUT TO TAKE US ALL

439
00:20:56,715 --> 00:20:59,176
TO THE SHOPPING CAPITAL
OF THE WORLD -

440
00:20:59,259 --> 00:21:00,385
NEW YORK CITY.

441
00:21:00,469 --> 00:21:02,137
NEW YORK?
ARE YOU SURE?

442
00:21:02,221 --> 00:21:03,514
I'VE DONE ALL THE BORING,
PRACTICAL MATH

443
00:21:03,597 --> 00:21:04,306
AND WE'RE GOING, BABY.

444
00:21:04,389 --> 00:21:05,015
SPIKE:
ALL RIGHT!

445
00:21:05,098 --> 00:21:06,767
WAIT.
WHO'S INCLUDED IN "WE"?

446
00:21:06,850 --> 00:21:08,769
WELL UM, YOU ARE PART
OF THE NELSON-SIMPSON CLAN,

447
00:21:08,852 --> 00:21:09,895
ARE YOU NOT?

448
00:21:09,978 --> 00:21:11,688
I LOVE YOU!
I LOVE YOU GUYS!

449
00:21:11,772 --> 00:21:13,857
HOW MANY EMPTY SUITCASES
CAN I BRING?

450
00:21:13,941 --> 00:21:14,816
(JOKINGLY CAUTIONS MANNY)
HEY, WHOA! HEY.

451
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:17,152
EMMA:
OKAY, THIS IS-
THIS IS BEYOND ANYTHING.

452
00:21:17,236 --> 00:21:18,570
IT ACTUALLY MIGHT BE ONE
OF THOSE MOMENTS.

453
00:21:18,654 --> 00:21:19,446
SO I'M GONNA
GET THE CAMERA.

454
00:21:19,530 --> 00:21:21,031
SIMPSON:
