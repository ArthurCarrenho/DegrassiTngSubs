00:00:01,376 --> 00:00:02,085
JIMMY:

2
00:00:02,169 --> 00:00:04,713
ALL RIGHT,

3
00:00:06,173 --> 00:00:07,299
GO BACK.
GO BACK UP TOP.

00:00:07,382 --> 00:00:09,676
DEREK:

00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:10,010
OW.

6
00:00:11,053 --> 00:00:12,012
TAKING IT EASY ON ME.

7
00:00:12,095 --> 00:00:13,972
DOES THIS LOOK EASY
OR PAINFUL?

8
00:00:14,056 --> 00:00:15,015
JIMMY:
SO GET UP.

9
00:00:15,098 --> 00:00:17,434
DEREK:
OKAY, LET'S GO.

10
00:00:19,061 --> 00:00:20,354
JIMMY:
ALL RIGHT, THAT'S IT.

11
00:00:20,437 --> 00:00:22,022
LOOK AT THAT.

12
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:27,903
HE'S GOT A LOT OF POTENTIAL,
BUT...

13
00:00:29,613 --> 00:00:30,364
(MUFFLED COMMENT)

14
00:00:32,074 --> 00:00:33,116
THERE YOU GO.

15
00:00:35,118 --> 00:00:36,119
SO HOW DID I DO?

16
00:00:36,203 --> 00:00:38,205
GOOD ENOUGH
TO MAKE THE TRYOUTS?

17
00:00:38,288 --> 00:00:39,331
WELL, TO BE HONEST,

18
00:00:39,414 --> 00:00:41,542
YOU'RE STILL A LITTLE
AWKWARD IN YOUR CHAIR.

19
00:00:41,625 --> 00:00:43,377

YOU CAN'T QUIT THE BAND.

46
00:02:02,039 --> 00:02:03,957
CAN SOMEBODY BE HAPPY
ABOUT THIS?

47
00:02:04,875 --> 00:02:06,126
THIS IS ME,

48
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:08,754
JIMMY THE ATHLETE.
I'M BACK.

49
00:02:08,837 --> 00:02:10,589
WHAT CAN I SAY?

50
00:02:10,672 --> 00:02:13,842
WE'LL MISS YOU
IN THE BAND BUT...

51
00:02:13,926 --> 00:02:14,801
GOOD LUCK.

52
00:02:16,053 --> 00:02:17,763

00:02:19,306 --> 00:02:20,390
THANK YOU.

56
00:02:22,851 --> 00:02:24,228
I'M HAPPY FOR YOU.

57
00:02:24,311 --> 00:02:27,356
WELCOME BACK,
JIMMY BROOKS.

58
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:29,107
SO, DO YOU THINK
YOU'LL MAKE THE TEAM?

59
00:02:33,195 --> 00:02:34,112
LIBERTY, HOLD UP!

60
00:02:36,073 --> 00:02:37,449
YOU'RE STARTING
TO SHOW.

61
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,619
PEOPLE BELIEVE WHAT
THEY WANT TO BELIEVE.

62
00:02:40,702 --> 00:02:41,537
OKAY?

63
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:42,496
AND NO ONE WANTS
TO BELIEVE

64
00:02:42,579 --> 00:02:43,872
THAT THEIR STUDENT
COUNCIL PRESIDENT

65
00:02:43,956 --> 00:02:46,500
IS IN HER THIRD
TRIMESTER.

66
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:48,669
HER THIRD TRI-WHAT?

67
00:02:49,461 --> 00:02:51,004
YOU DON'T KNOW ANYTHING,
DO YOU?

68
00:02:51,088 --> 00:02:52,339
HAVE YOU DONE
ANY RESEARCH?

69
00:02:52,422 --> 00:02:53,382
YEAH, I HAVE,
OKAY?

70
00:02:53,465 --> 00:02:54,424
TONS.

71
00:02:56,844 --> 00:02:57,886
OKAY, I'M LYING.

72
00:02:57,970 --> 00:02:58,804
BUT THE THING IS...

73
00:02:58,887 --> 00:03:01,348
EVERY TIME I LOOK
AT THOSE BOOKS,

74
00:03:01,431 --> 00:03:03,642
I JUST GET KIND OF
FLUSTERED.

75
00:03:03,725 --> 00:03:04,726
THEY FREAK ME OUT.

76
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:05,936
WHY AM I NOT
SURPRISED?

77
00:03:06,895 --> 00:03:08,397
DANNY:
HEADS UP!

78
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:09,982
(BABY CRIES)

79
00:03:10,482 --> 00:03:12,192
DANNY,
ARE YOU INSANE?

80
00:03:12,276 --> 00:03:15,737
I'M NOT THE ONE
WHO MISSED A FLYING BABY.

81
00:03:15,821 --> 00:03:17,447
WHAT IS THIS?

82
00:03:19,867 --> 00:03:21,618
THE DIGITAL BABY.

83
00:03:21,702 --> 00:03:22,911
SHHH. SHHH.

84
00:03:22,995 --> 00:03:24,037
FAMILY PLANNING PROJECT.

85
00:03:24,121 --> 00:03:26,874
I'M MR. MOM FOR A WEEK.

86
00:03:26,957 --> 00:03:28,876
WHY ARE YOU TAKING
FAMILY PLANNING?

87
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:30,002
WHY DOES ANYONE TAKE IT?

88
00:03:30,085 --> 00:03:31,295
'CAUSE IT'S A BIRD COURSE.

89
00:03:31,378 --> 00:03:32,546
PLUS,

90
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:34,214
THE CLASS IS FULL
OF FLY MAMMIES

91
00:03:34,298 --> 00:03:36,216
AND ONE DUDE -
ME.

92
00:03:37,009 --> 00:03:39,011
I LIKE THOSE ODDS.

93
00:03:44,349 --> 00:03:46,435
WHAT ARE YOU DRAWING?

94
00:03:46,518 --> 00:03:47,769
IT'S NOTHING.

95
00:03:47,853 --> 00:03:50,898
PEN'S HITTING PAPER
AND LEAVING A SERIES OF MARKS.

96
00:03:50,981 --> 00:03:53,859
DEDUCTION SAYS
YOU'RE DRAWING.

97
00:03:53,942 --> 00:03:55,235
MY DAD SAID HE'D GET ME
A NEW WHEELCHAIR

98
00:03:55,319 --> 00:03:57,279
IF I MAKE
THE PARALYMPIC TEAM -

99
00:03:57,362 --> 00:04:00,240
HAND-MADE,
DESIGNED BY ME.

100
00:04:00,324 --> 00:04:02,117
ELLIE:
WHAT'S THIS?

101
00:04:02,201 --> 00:04:03,869
I KNEW YOU COULD GET CREATIVE
WITH A GUITAR SLIDE,

102
00:04:03,952 --> 00:04:04,578
BUT THIS IS
A WHOLE DIFFERENT...

103
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,833
AND DISTURBING SIDE OF YOU.

104
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:12,586
IT'S REALLY JUST SOMETHING
I STARTED IN THE HOSPITAL

105
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:13,921
TO PASS THE TIME.

106
00:04:14,004 --> 00:04:15,130
IT KINDA MAKES ME CHILL.

107
00:04:15,214 --> 00:04:16,924
THESE ARE REALLY GOOD.

108
00:04:17,007 --> 00:04:19,676
I DON'T THINK YOU KNOW
HOW GOOD.

109
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:44,993
MR. BROOKS:
WORK ON YOUR CHAIR MANEUVERING.

110
00:04:45,077 --> 00:04:46,411
HE DID SAY
YOU WERE A LITTLE AWKWARD.

111
00:04:56,004 --> 00:04:56,922
(GUNSHOT)

112
00:04:57,005 --> 00:04:57,506
AHHHH!

113
00:04:58,090 --> 00:04:59,758
CRAIG:
JIMMY!

114
00:05:02,052 --> 00:05:03,428
ELLIE:
THESE ARE REALLY GOOD.

115
00:05:03,512 --> 00:05:06,682
I DON'T THING YOU KNOW
HOW GOOD.

116
00:05:10,561 --> 00:05:11,228
MR. BROOKS:
JIM?

117
00:05:12,604 --> 00:05:13,897
YOU OKAY?

118
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:15,899
YEAH,
I'M GOOD TO GO.

119
00:05:16,859 --> 00:05:17,734
COULD'VE FOOLED ME.

120
00:05:19,111 --> 00:05:20,028
DAD, I'M FINE.

121
00:05:20,112 --> 00:05:20,737
I JUST...

122
00:05:22,906 --> 00:05:24,741
I JUST KEEP LOSING FOCUS,

123
00:05:24,825 --> 00:05:27,244
AND I DON'T FEEL THE FLOW
LIKE I USED TO.

124
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:31,248
MR. BROOKS:
THAT'S JUST STRESS TALKING.

125
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:34,501
MAKING THIS TEAM IS
THE BE-ALL-AND-END-ALL FOR YOU.

126
00:05:34,585 --> 00:05:35,878
SO OF COURSE YOU
FEEL STRESSED OUT.

127
00:05:35,961 --> 00:05:37,880
IT'S NATURAL, SON.

128
00:05:37,963 --> 00:05:39,715
YOU'RE RIGHT.

129
00:05:39,798 --> 00:05:43,594
YOU KNOW THAT 90 PERCENT
OF BEING A CHAMPION IS MENTAL.

130
00:05:43,677 --> 00:05:45,179
DO WE NEED TO GET YOU
A SPORTS PSYCHOLOGIST

131
00:05:45,262 --> 00:05:47,264
BEFORE THE TRYOUT?

132
00:05:48,307 --> 00:05:49,850
YOU'RE WORRIED ABOUT
LETTING ME DOWN?

133
00:05:49,933 --> 00:05:51,101
I'M NOT.

134
00:05:51,768 --> 00:05:54,771
LOOK,
STOP WORRYING ABOUT ME.

135
00:05:54,855 --> 00:05:56,356
I'M GONNA DO THIS.

136
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:57,524
OKAY.

137
00:05:57,608 --> 00:05:59,776
OKAY.
THAT'S MY BOY.

138
00:06:05,407 --> 00:06:06,950
(BABY'S HEAD THUDS
AGAINST THE DOOR)

139
00:06:07,034 --> 00:06:09,703
LIBERTY, YOUR TIME WAS UP
20 MINUTES AGO!

140
00:06:09,786 --> 00:06:11,872
LIBERTY:
GO AWAY. I'M SICK.

141
00:06:11,955 --> 00:06:13,290
YEAH?
WELL, I'M SICK TOO.

142
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:14,541
SICK OF WAITING FOR YOU
TO GET YOUR SORRY BUTT

143
00:06:14,625 --> 00:06:16,710
OUT OF THE BATHROOM
EVERY MORNING.

144
00:06:16,793 --> 00:06:18,295
(TOILET FLUSHES)

145
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:19,379
(BABY CRIES)

146
00:06:20,547 --> 00:06:22,883
WHAT IS THAT SMELL?

147
00:06:22,966 --> 00:06:24,551
BODY SPRAY.

148
00:06:24,635 --> 00:06:26,595
THE AD SAID IT'LL ATTRACT
THE FLY MAMMIES

149
00:06:26,678 --> 00:06:28,263
LIKE A SEX MAGNET.

150
00:06:28,347 --> 00:06:29,932
YEAH, WELL,
IT'S TURNING MY STOMACH.

151
00:06:30,015 --> 00:06:31,058
WAIT.

152
00:06:31,141 --> 00:06:32,851
I KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON.

153
00:06:32,935 --> 00:06:34,269
YOU'RE IN HERE BLOWING
CHUNKS EVERY MORNING

154
00:06:34,353 --> 00:06:36,730
LIKE IT'S GOING OUT
OF STYLE.

155
00:06:36,813 --> 00:06:38,524
YOU'RE BULIMIC!

156
00:06:38,607 --> 00:06:39,816
YEAH,
I'M BULIMIC.

157
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:41,485
BRILLIANT DEDUCTION.

158
00:06:41,568 --> 00:06:44,071
WELL, IF YOU'RE GONNA
BINGE AND PURGE,

159
00:06:44,154 --> 00:06:45,405
DO IT SOMEWHERE ELSE.

160
00:06:45,489 --> 00:06:47,115
NOT THAT IT'S WORKING,
TUBBO.

161
00:06:55,791 --> 00:06:56,834
(COMPUTER BEEPS)

162
00:07:05,843 --> 00:07:08,846
IT'S AN ART EXHIBIT
DOWNTOWN.

163
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:12,391
I'M NOT REALLY THE ART EXHIBIT
TYPE OF GUY.

164
00:07:12,474 --> 00:07:15,769
BUT THIS IS HORROR COMIC ART
FROM THE 50S:

165
00:07:15,853 --> 00:07:17,938
COOL, DARK, DISTURBED.

166
00:07:18,021 --> 00:07:20,190
RIGHT UP YOUR ALLEY.

167
00:07:20,858 --> 00:07:22,526
SOUNDS LIKE.

168
00:07:22,609 --> 00:07:25,529
BUT I GOT TRYOUTS
AT 6:00 P.M..

169
00:07:25,612 --> 00:07:27,114
OH, TOO BAD.

170
00:07:28,115 --> 00:07:31,410
IT'S THE LAST DAY
OF THE EXHIBIT.

171
00:07:31,493 --> 00:07:32,786
LOOK...

172
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:34,621
ELLIE, I GOT A LOT
ON MY MIND.

173
00:07:34,705 --> 00:07:37,457
ALL THE MORE REASON
TO GO SOMEPLACE ELSE.

174
00:07:37,541 --> 00:07:38,667
IN YOUR MIND,
I MEAN,

175
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:40,169
BUT WHATEV.

176
00:08:05,652 --> 00:08:08,322
LIBERTY,
WE NEED TO TALK.

177
00:08:08,405 --> 00:08:09,406
NOT NOW.

178
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:10,657
MY STOMACH
IS DOING CARTWHEELS.

179
00:08:10,741 --> 00:08:12,743
I FEEL HORRID.

180
00:08:12,826 --> 00:08:14,620
JT:
IF YOU KEEP ACTING LIKE
YOU HAVE SOMETHING TO HIDE,

181
00:08:14,703 --> 00:08:16,079
PEOPLE ARE GONNA
START TO WONDER.

182
00:08:16,163 --> 00:08:17,456
LIBERTY:
I GET MORNING SICKNESS.

183
00:08:17,539 --> 00:08:19,082
AND THE AMOUNT OF TIME
I SPEND IN THE BATHROOM-

184
00:08:19,166 --> 00:08:20,042
DANNY:
NO WAY.

185
00:08:20,125 --> 00:08:22,044
LIBERTY:
IT'S ALREADY MAKING
SOME PEOPLE WONDER.

186
00:08:22,127 --> 00:08:23,462
YOU THINK THIS HAS BEEN EASY?

187
00:08:23,545 --> 00:08:25,005
DANNY:
NO WAY!

188
00:08:25,088 --> 00:08:27,424
JT, I WANT TO TALK WITH YOU!

189
00:08:29,218 --> 00:08:30,135
YOU GOT MY SISTER PREGNANT?!

190
00:08:30,219 --> 00:08:32,054
I'M GOING TO KILL YOU!

191
00:08:34,681 --> 00:08:36,975
LIBERTY:
DANNY, STOP IT!

192
00:08:37,059 --> 00:08:39,102
DANNY, GET OFF HIM!

193
00:08:40,229 --> 00:08:41,939
JT:
AHH! CAN'T BREATH!

194
00:08:42,022 --> 00:08:43,357
LIBERTY:
DANNY, STOP IT!

195
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,608
GET OFF HIM!

196
00:08:44,691 --> 00:08:45,859
STOP IT!

197
00:08:49,238 --> 00:08:50,447
LIBERTY, HOW COULD
YOU LET THIS IDIOT

198
00:08:50,531 --> 00:08:51,198
DO THAT TO YOU?!

199
00:08:51,865 --> 00:08:53,116
IT WAS AN ACCIDENT.

200
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,326
I WAS SPEAKING
TO MY SISTER.

201
00:08:56,119 --> 00:08:57,788
DO MOM AND DAD EVEN KNOW?

202
00:08:57,871 --> 00:08:58,914
DANNY, I BEG YOU,

203
00:08:58,997 --> 00:09:01,124
PLEASE, DO NOT TELL.

204
00:09:07,923 --> 00:09:10,050
LIKE THAT WORK IN THERE
WAS SICK.

205
00:09:10,133 --> 00:09:11,343
THAT'S WHAT I LIVE FOR.

206
00:09:11,426 --> 00:09:14,805
ELLIE:
IS IT OKAY TO BE
SCARED RIGHT NOW?

207
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:17,808
SO? SHOULD WE GO?

208
00:09:18,892 --> 00:09:20,853
DON'T YOU HAVE TO
MENTALLY PREPARE?

209
00:09:20,936 --> 00:09:23,730
GET IN YOUR BASKETBALL
ZONEY-ZONE?

210
00:09:23,814 --> 00:09:25,649
IT'S A LITTLE CROWDED
IN THERE RIGHT NOW

211
00:09:25,732 --> 00:09:28,652
AND THIS IS QUIET.
IT'S GOOD.

212
00:09:33,156 --> 00:09:35,200
AND...
THIS IS A BOX.

213
00:09:38,871 --> 00:09:43,125
YOU KNOW, I THINK
THEY HAVE LESSONS HERE.

214
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:45,169
JIMMY:
IN PROPER BOX PLACEMENT?

215
00:09:45,252 --> 00:09:46,003
NO.

218
00:09:49,423 --> 00:09:51,133
YOU MIGHT LIKE IT.

219
00:09:52,384 --> 00:09:54,094
I JUST DRAW STUFF
I IMAGINE.

220
00:09:54,178 --> 00:09:56,597
STUFF I SEE
WHEN I CLOSE MY EYES.

221
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:58,432
IT'S LIKE I HAVE A PEN
IN MY HAND

222
00:09:58,515 --> 00:10:01,101
AND EVERYTHING
JUST GOES "SHHHHH".

223
00:10:01,185 --> 00:10:02,895
AND THEN I CAN SAY
EVERYTHING I WANT TO SAY -

224
00:10:02,978 --> 00:10:04,688
EVERYTHING I NEED
TO SAY -

225
00:10:04,771 --> 00:10:07,941
RIGHT THERE ON THAT

226
00:10:08,025 --> 00:10:12,112
YOU'RE SOUNDING SUSPICIOUSLY
LIKE AN ARTIST.

00:10:12,196 --> 00:10:13,530
AN ARTIST?

228
00:10:14,489 --> 00:10:16,617
DOES THAT SOUND LIKE
JIMMY BROOKS TO YOU?

YOU DON'T WANT THE SPOT.

246
00:10:52,736 --> 00:10:54,488
NO, I WANT TO PLAY, SIR.
I DO.

MR. BROOKS:
COACH MORRIS,

249
00:10:57,324 --> 00:10:58,992
THIS'LL NEVER HAPPEN AGAIN.

250
00:10:59,076 --> 00:11:00,702
PLEASE LET US TRY OUT.

251
00:11:00,786 --> 00:11:02,663
I PERSONALLY ENSURE
THAT JIMMY WILL BE HERE,

252
00:11:02,746 --> 00:11:04,456
ON TIME,
READY TO GO.

253
00:11:05,582 --> 00:11:08,293
OKAY, LOOK,
I'LL MAKE AN EXCEPTION FOR YOU.

254
00:11:08,377 --> 00:11:09,920
BE HERE TOMORROW.

255
00:11:10,003 --> 00:11:11,046
I'LL GET YOU A SPOT,
OKAY?

256
00:11:11,129 --> 00:11:12,422
THANK YOU, COACH.
I WON'T LET YOU DOWN.

257
00:11:13,924 --> 00:11:14,299
YEAH.

258
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:17,678
YOU NEITHER, DAD.

259
00:11:18,428 --> 00:11:19,763
I PROMISE.

260
00:11:27,813 --> 00:11:28,146
WOW.

261
00:11:39,199 --> 00:11:40,117
OKAY, SEE?
NOW YOU'RE TEMPTING ME.

262
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,452
I MISS THIS SHOT
AND YOUR LEXUS WEARS A DENT.

263
00:11:42,536 --> 00:11:44,454
MR. BROOKS:
DON'T MISS THE SHOT...

264
00:11:44,538 --> 00:11:45,956
OR DON'T TAKE IT.

265
00:11:47,374 --> 00:11:50,085
UNTIL YOU'RE SITTING IN THIS.

266
00:11:50,169 --> 00:11:51,587
JIMMY:
IT'S AWESOME.

267
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:54,923
BUT WHAT HAPPENED TO ME
DESIGNING MY OWN?

268
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:56,884
JIM, THIS IS THE TOP
OF THE LINE.

269
00:11:56,967 --> 00:11:57,801
THE LEXUS.

270
00:11:59,052 --> 00:11:59,636
YOU GOT TO HAVE THE BEST

271
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:00,929
IF YOU'RE GONNA BE A CHAMPION.

272
00:12:02,347 --> 00:12:04,099
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO SAY.

273
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,979
YOU WEREN'T SUPPOSED TO GET IT
UNTIL AFTER YOU MADE THE TEAM.

274
00:12:09,062 --> 00:12:11,148
BUT AFTER YOUR LITTLE
STUNT YESTERDAY?

275
00:12:11,231 --> 00:12:13,942
I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT NEED
THE INCENTIVE.

276
00:12:14,026 --> 00:12:17,321
BY SHOWING UP LATE,
YOUR DISCIPLINE WAS QUESTIONED.

277
00:12:17,404 --> 00:12:19,323
YOU SHOW UP TONIGHT IN THIS,

278
00:12:19,406 --> 00:12:21,742

279
00:12:21,825 --> 00:12:23,243
WE'LL ALL TAKE YOU
SERIOUSLY.

280
00:12:32,586 --> 00:12:33,212
DANNY?

281
00:12:35,631 --> 00:12:37,174
STILL NOT TALKING
TO EITHER OF YOU.

282
00:12:37,925 --> 00:12:39,635
I BARELY SLEPT LAST NIGHT,
OKAY?

283
00:12:39,718 --> 00:12:41,386
I HAD NIGHTMARES
WITH PITCHFORKS

284
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:42,471
AND TORCHES.

285
00:12:42,554 --> 00:12:43,138
AND BABIES?

286
00:12:43,222 --> 00:12:45,557
DANIEL,
THIS IS SERIOUS.

287
00:12:45,641 --> 00:12:47,184
YOU DIDN'T TELL
MOM OR DAD, RIGHT?

288
00:12:47,267 --> 00:12:49,353
IF I DID,
YOU'D KNOW.

289
00:12:49,436 --> 00:12:51,021
BECAUSE YOU'D BOTH
BE DEAD RIGHT NOW.

290
00:12:51,104 --> 00:12:53,273
PRECISELY WHY THIS NEEDS
TO REMAIN OUR SECRET.

291
00:12:54,274 --> 00:12:55,692
DO WE HAVE YOUR WORD?

292
00:12:55,776 --> 00:12:56,777
JT:
DANNY,

293
00:12:56,777 --> 00:12:57,903
YOU CAN'T TELL ANYONE.

294
00:12:57,986 --> 00:13:00,155
OH YES I CAN, IDIOT.

295
00:13:01,114 --> 00:13:02,282
BUT I WON'T.

296
00:13:02,366 --> 00:13:05,786
SO LONG AS YOU HELP ME
AND THE KID GET AN "A".

297
00:13:05,869 --> 00:13:07,621
IT'S NOT LIKE YOU DON'T NEED
THE PRACTICE, DAD.

298
00:13:19,466 --> 00:13:21,844

I'M NOT GETTING THE FIT.

HEY, JIM?

300
00:13:27,224 --> 00:13:28,809
SOMEONE TO SEE YOU.

301
00:13:33,063 --> 00:13:34,356
I WANTED TO APOLOGIZE.

302
00:13:34,439 --> 00:13:37,025
THERE IS NOTHING
TO APOLOGIZE FOR.

303
00:13:37,109 --> 00:13:38,485
I MADE YOU
MISS YOUR TRYOUT.

304
00:13:38,569 --> 00:13:40,320
I'M GETTING ANOTHER CHANCE.

305
00:13:40,404 --> 00:13:43,574
AND BESIDES,
I HAD FUN WITH YOU.

306
00:13:44,324 --> 00:13:45,993
I'M GOING
TO THE GALLERY TODAY.

307
00:13:46,076 --> 00:13:47,202
TO SIGN UP
FOR LIFE-DRAWING CLASSES.

308
00:13:47,286 --> 00:13:49,413
I CAN PUT YOUR NAME DOWN TOO.

309
00:13:49,496 --> 00:13:50,664
UH...

310
00:13:51,331 --> 00:13:53,709
ELLIE:
HEY, YOU SHOWED TALENT.

311
00:13:53,792 --> 00:13:55,961
THIS IS ME
ENCOURAGING IT.

312
00:13:56,044 --> 00:13:57,421
THIS IS ME THANKING YOU,

313
00:13:57,504 --> 00:13:58,589
BUT... NO.

314
00:14:02,176 --> 00:14:03,093
OKAY.

315
00:14:07,931 --> 00:14:10,267
DEREK:
SO... CAN I ASK HER OUT?

316
00:14:11,602 --> 00:14:12,352
JUST THROW ME
THE DAMN BALL.

317
00:14:14,688 --> 00:14:15,189
AHHHH!

318
00:14:16,857 --> 00:14:18,192
YOU OKAY?!

319
00:14:19,234 --> 00:14:20,360
(GROANS)

320
00:14:21,195 --> 00:14:23,238
(BABIES CRY)

321
00:14:27,618 --> 00:14:30,454
I CAN'T BELIEVE
I'M SKIPPING BIO FOR THIS.

00:14:30,537 --> 00:14:32,039
JUST SUPPORT ITS NECK,
MORON,

323
00:14:32,122 --> 00:14:33,790
AND STOP COMPLAINING.

324
00:14:33,874 --> 00:14:35,125
IF YOU'D KEPT THE DIME-STACK
IN YOUR PANTS,

325
00:14:35,209 --> 00:14:36,919
YOU WOULDN'T BE
IN THIS SITUATION.

326
00:14:37,002 --> 00:14:38,253
WHATEVER.

327
00:14:40,881 --> 00:14:43,091
WHY WON'T THIS THING
STOP CRYING?

328
00:14:43,175 --> 00:14:44,301
BURP IT.

329
00:14:44,384 --> 00:14:46,303
I AM NOT BURPING
A DOLL.

330
00:14:47,012 --> 00:14:47,971
HMMM...

331
00:14:48,055 --> 00:14:50,265
SENSORS INSIDE DETECT
NO BURPING,

332
00:14:50,349 --> 00:14:51,558
I GET A BAD GRADE,

333
00:14:51,642 --> 00:14:54,728
EVERYONE FINDS OUT
YOUR SECRET.

334
00:14:54,811 --> 00:14:56,438
YOU'RE JUST LOVING THIS,
AREN'T YOU?

335
00:15:02,986 --> 00:15:03,904
THANK YOU.

336
00:15:03,987 --> 00:15:05,614
DOES IT HURT?

337
00:15:05,697 --> 00:15:07,032
I'LL LIVE.

338
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:12,579
WE'RE IN THE NURSE'S
OFFICE.

339
00:15:12,663 --> 00:15:13,413
SO?

340
00:15:14,456 --> 00:15:16,041
SO NOTHING.

341
00:15:16,124 --> 00:15:18,418
JUST NOT IN THE MOOD.

342
00:15:20,295 --> 00:15:21,839
I SPOKE TO YOUR DAD.

343
00:15:21,922 --> 00:15:23,340
HE'S WORRIED.

344
00:15:23,423 --> 00:15:25,551
AND AFTER TALKING TO HIM?

345
00:15:25,634 --> 00:15:26,301
SO AM I.

346
00:15:28,595 --> 00:15:30,681
HE SAID YOU MISSED
YOUR TRYOUTS LAST NIGHT

347
00:15:30,764 --> 00:15:32,266
BECAUSE YOU WERE
AT THE ART GALLERY

348
00:15:32,349 --> 00:15:33,684
WITH ELLIE NASH.

349
00:15:34,935 --> 00:15:37,104
I JUST NEEDED TO FOCUS
AND IT WAS QUIET.

350
00:15:37,187 --> 00:15:39,356
HAZEL:
SO IS THE LIBRARY.

351
00:15:39,439 --> 00:15:40,691
I LIKE ART.

352
00:15:40,774 --> 00:15:42,609
MAYBE I LIKE ART, TOO.

353
00:15:43,318 --> 00:15:44,611
DO YOU, REALLY?

354
00:15:45,362 --> 00:15:46,363
NO, I DON'T.

355
00:15:46,989 --> 00:15:48,615
I DON'T GET ART AT ALL.

356
00:15:48,699 --> 00:15:51,368
BUT IF YOU WERE FREAKED OUT
OR LOSING IT?

357
00:15:51,451 --> 00:15:54,037
I WOULD'VE HOPED
I'D BE THE ONE YOU'D GO TO.

358
00:15:54,121 --> 00:15:54,955
NOT ELLIE.

359
00:16:11,471 --> 00:16:13,223
WHAT HAPPENED
TO YOUR HAND?

360
00:16:13,307 --> 00:16:15,893
IT'S A LITTLE SPRAIN.
IT'S NO BIG DEAL.

361
00:16:15,976 --> 00:16:18,020
LOOK DAD, I GOTTA TALK TO YOU
ABOUT THIS NEW CHAIR.

362
00:16:18,103 --> 00:16:20,647
IT'S NOT RIDING
LIKE MY OLD ONE.

363
00:16:20,731 --> 00:16:22,816
IT RIDES BETTER,
I'M SURE.

364
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:23,775
IT'S THE SAME MODEL
THE TEAM PLAYS IN.

365
00:16:23,859 --> 00:16:26,862
YEAH, DAD,
THIS ISN'T HELPING ME.

366
00:16:26,945 --> 00:16:29,239
WELL,
HOW CAN I HELP YOU?

367
00:16:29,323 --> 00:16:31,408
I JUST WANT YOU
TO WIN, SON.

368
00:16:31,491 --> 00:16:32,868
I WANT YOU TO FEEL GOOD
ABOUT YOURSELF.

369
00:16:32,951 --> 00:16:35,746
I WANT YOU TO BE
YOU AGAIN.

370
00:16:35,829 --> 00:16:37,456
DAD, I CAN'T.

371
00:16:37,539 --> 00:16:38,540
THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

372
00:16:38,624 --> 00:16:40,918
I'M IN A WHEELCHAIR,
OKAY?

373
00:16:41,001 --> 00:16:42,503
I AM NEVER
WALKING AGAIN.

374
00:16:42,586 --> 00:16:43,378
I KNOW, SON.

375
00:16:43,462 --> 00:16:45,172
NO YOU DON'T.

376
00:16:45,255 --> 00:16:48,175
'CAUSE YOU KEEP TRYING
TO BRING THIS OLD JIMMY BACK -

377
00:16:48,258 --> 00:16:50,761
THE STAR PLAYER,
THE ATHLETE.

378
00:16:50,844 --> 00:16:52,763
THAT JIMMY IS GONE.

379
00:16:52,846 --> 00:16:54,431
THAT JIMMY GOT SHOT.

380
00:16:57,184 --> 00:16:58,602
JIMMY, YOU'RE UNDER A LOT
OF PRESSURE RIGHT NOW.

381
00:16:58,685 --> 00:17:00,646
YOU THINK?

382
00:17:00,729 --> 00:17:03,232
AND WHERE'S THAT PRESSURE
COMING FROM, DAD?

383
00:17:03,315 --> 00:17:03,982
FROM ME?

384
00:17:05,692 --> 00:17:08,362
HAVE YOU EVER ASKED ME
JUST ONCE,

385
00:17:08,445 --> 00:17:09,696
IF I WANT THIS?

386
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:14,826
COACH MORRIS:
JIMMY, YOU READY?

387
00:17:16,328 --> 00:17:18,163
YEAH,
I'M READY.

388
00:17:30,425 --> 00:17:31,301
DANNY:
THE BABY'S CRYING.

389
00:17:31,385 --> 00:17:32,553
JT:
THANKS, YODA.
I NOTICED.

390
00:17:32,636 --> 00:17:33,595
DANNY:
WELL, MAKE HIM STOP
OR GIVE HIM BACK TO ME.

391
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:34,596
YOU'RE GONNA MAKE ME FAIL!

392
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:35,264
JT:
NO, I WON'T.

393
00:17:35,347 --> 00:17:35,722
YOU WILL.

394
00:17:35,806 --> 00:17:36,807
FACE IT, JT.
YOU SUCK!

395
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:37,391
I DON'T SUCK!

396
00:17:37,474 --> 00:17:39,017
I JUST NEED A LITTLE
MORE PRACTICE!

397
00:17:39,101 --> 00:17:40,477
YEAH,
A LIFETIME'S WORTH.

398
00:17:40,561 --> 00:17:41,645
GIVE ME THE BABY BACK!

399
00:17:41,728 --> 00:17:42,771
(BABY CRYING)

400
00:17:47,067 --> 00:17:47,776
BOTH:
NO!

401
00:18:02,916 --> 00:18:04,918
NICE WORK, GENIUS.

402
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:29,902
COACH MORRIS:
HEY, YOU OKAY TO START
WITH FREETHROWS?

403
00:18:32,279 --> 00:18:33,530
WHAT'S THE MATTER?
YOUR HAND?

404
00:18:35,616 --> 00:18:37,701
LOOK, I MEAN NO DISRESPECT
AT ALL, COACH.

405
00:18:37,784 --> 00:18:38,118
BUT...

406
00:18:39,203 --> 00:18:40,746
ALL THIS JUST ISN'T FOR ME.

407
00:18:41,288 --> 00:18:42,915
SO YOU WASTED MY TIME?

408
00:18:44,124 --> 00:18:46,460
AND I'M SORRY FOR THAT, SIR.

409
00:18:48,670 --> 00:18:49,588
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

410
00:18:49,671 --> 00:18:51,757
LET'S JUST GO HOME.

411
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:54,968
WHAT ABOUT THE TEAM?

412
00:18:55,636 --> 00:18:56,470
DAD, STOP.

413
00:18:59,223 --> 00:19:01,892
THIS IS MY LIFE NOT YOURS.

414
00:19:03,435 --> 00:19:06,438
WE GOT A LOT OF STUFF
TO TALK ABOUT.

415
00:19:15,781 --> 00:19:17,324
I GOT AN "INCOMPLETE".

416
00:19:17,407 --> 00:19:18,825
THANKS, JT.

417
00:19:20,494 --> 00:19:23,956
YOU WERE THE ONE
WHO BLACKMAILED ME, OKAY,

418
00:19:24,039 --> 00:19:25,749
INTO SCAMMING
A GOOD GRADE!

419
00:19:25,832 --> 00:19:27,000
NO, I BLACKMAILED YOU

420
00:19:27,084 --> 00:19:28,168
BECAUSE YOU'RE GOING
TO HAVE A BABY, IDIOT!

421
00:19:28,252 --> 00:19:29,211
SHHH.

422
00:19:29,753 --> 00:19:31,630
YOU NEED TO LEARN
THIS STUFF.

423
00:19:31,713 --> 00:19:34,007
I JUST THOUGHT
I COULD HELP.

424
00:19:34,091 --> 00:19:35,551
LIBERTY:
THAT IS THE DUMBEST THING
I'VE HEARD

425
00:19:35,634 --> 00:19:37,010
COME OUT OF YOUR MOUTH.

426
00:19:37,094 --> 00:19:38,679
OKAY, I'VE BEEN DEALING
WITH THIS ON MY OWN,

427
00:19:38,762 --> 00:19:40,013
FOR MONTHS.

428
00:19:40,556 --> 00:19:41,849
I HAVEN'T NEEDED
ANY HELP SO FAR

429
00:19:41,932 --> 00:19:43,267
AND I DON'T NOW.

430
00:19:43,809 --> 00:19:46,562
YOU'RE WRONG,
LIBERTY, OKAY?

431
00:19:46,645 --> 00:19:49,231
WE'RE BOTH TOTALLY
CLUELESS HERE.

432
00:19:49,314 --> 00:19:50,899
SPEAK FOR YOURSELF.

433
00:19:52,025 --> 00:19:54,695
YOU'RE SIX MONTHS PREGNANT

434
00:19:55,654 --> 00:19:57,072
AND YOU HAVEN'T EVEN SEEN
A DOCTOR YET.

435
00:19:57,155 --> 00:19:58,991
THAT'S NOT GOOD.

436
00:19:59,074 --> 00:20:02,077
I'M STUDENT COUNCIL
PRESIDENT, OKAY?

437
00:20:03,954 --> 00:20:06,123
I CAN'T BE PREGNANT.

438
00:20:06,748 --> 00:20:08,333
I JUST... CAN'T.

439
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:12,629
THIS ISN'T JUST ABOUT YOU,
RIGHT?

440
00:20:13,255 --> 00:20:16,675
IT'S ABOUT YOU
AND THIS BABY AND ME.

441
00:20:16,758 --> 00:20:17,384
AND ME.

442
00:20:18,594 --> 00:20:21,680
HEY, I'M THE UNCLE HERE,
OKAY?

443
00:20:21,763 --> 00:20:24,516
WE'LL GO TO MS. SAUVE,
TOMORROW.

444
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:27,269
SHE'LL TELL US
WHAT TO DO.

445
00:20:33,275 --> 00:20:35,277
I'M SORRY I DIDN'T CALL YOU
LAST NIGHT.

446
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:36,486
I WAS HAVING A LONG TALK
WITH MY DAD

447
00:20:36,570 --> 00:20:37,905
ABOUT A LOT OF STUFF.

448
00:20:37,988 --> 00:20:39,323
YOU COULD'VE EMAILED.

449
00:20:39,406 --> 00:20:42,951
I JUST WANTED TO KNOW
IF YOU MADE THE TEAM.

450
00:20:43,035 --> 00:20:44,328
IT'S OKAY.

451
00:20:44,411 --> 00:20:46,205
YOU'VE BEEN UNDER
A LOT OF STRESS.

452
00:20:46,288 --> 00:20:47,247
YOU CAN TRY AGAIN?

453
00:20:47,331 --> 00:20:50,751
THAT'S THE THING...
I DON'T WANT TO.

454
00:20:50,834 --> 00:20:52,628
EVERYTHING I'VE BEEN
THROUGH THIS PAST YEAR -

455
00:20:52,711 --> 00:20:55,756
ALL THE PHYSIO,
THE THERAPY, THE TRAINING -

456
00:20:55,839 --> 00:20:57,591
IT'S ALL BEEN TO GET BACK
TO HOW I WAS

457
00:20:57,674 --> 00:20:59,384
BEFORE I GOT SHOT.

458
00:20:59,468 --> 00:21:01,220
AND YOU ARE.
YOU ARE BACK.

459
00:21:01,303 --> 00:21:03,055
NO. I'M NOT.

460
00:21:03,138 --> 00:21:04,765
I'VE CHANGED.

461
00:21:05,474 --> 00:21:07,017
AND I GOTTA MAKE
SOME CHANGES TOO.

462
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:08,936
HAZEL:
NO. YOU'RE WRONG.

463
00:21:09,019 --> 00:21:10,562
YOU HAVEN'T CHANGED.

464
00:21:10,646 --> 00:21:13,232
'CAUSE WHEN I LOOK IN YOUR EYES
I STILL SEE YOU.

465
00:21:13,315 --> 00:21:14,566
I STILL SEE
THE SAME OLD JIMMY.

466
00:21:14,650 --> 00:21:16,151
HAZEL,
IT'S COMPLICATED.

467
00:21:16,235 --> 00:21:17,611
THEN EXPLAIN IT TO ME.

468
00:21:17,694 --> 00:21:19,196
I DON'T KNOW IF I CAN.

469
00:21:19,279 --> 00:21:21,114
HAZEL:
JUST TRY.

470
00:21:28,622 --> 00:21:29,540
OKAY.

471
00:21:31,166 --> 00:21:31,834
I'LL TRY.
