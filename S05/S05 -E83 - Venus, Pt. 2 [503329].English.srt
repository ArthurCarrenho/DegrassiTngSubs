00:00:03,253 --> 00:00:04,296
(MUFFLED THUMPS)

3
00:00:04,379 --> 00:00:05,297
(LOUD BANG)

4
00:00:07,257 --> 00:00:09,259
(ITEMS BOUNCE AND THUMP
ON FLOOR)

5
00:00:12,471 --> 00:00:13,639
EMMA:
I THOUGHT YOU CRAWLED
IN SOMEBODY ELSE'S HOUSE

6
00:00:13,722 --> 00:00:14,723
BY ACCIDENT.

7
00:00:17,434 --> 00:00:18,268
(CRASH)

8
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:20,354
(SPLASH)
(MUFFLED SCREAM)

00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:22,064
(QUIET LAUGH)

10
00:00:23,357 --> 00:00:23,732
EMMA:
OH NO.

11
00:00:23,815 --> 00:00:25,192
YOU LOOK LIKE A PRETZEL.

12
00:00:25,275 --> 00:00:26,944
(LOUDLY) MY INSIDES
ARE KINDA PRETZEL-Y TOO,

13
00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:28,028
LET ME TELL YOU.

14
00:00:28,111 --> 00:00:29,530
SHHH!
AND I AM
SOAKING WET!

15
00:00:29,613 --> 00:00:31,865
HOW AM I GOING TO WEAR THIS
TO SCHOOL TOMORROW?!

16
00:00:31,949 --> 00:00:32,533
SHHH!

17
00:00:32,616 --> 00:00:35,244
MY PARENTS
ARE SLEEPING.

18
00:00:35,327 --> 00:00:36,787
I'LL LOAN YOU
WHATEVER YOU WANT.

19
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:38,163
BUT YOU NEED
TO TELL ME

20
00:00:38,247 --> 00:00:40,499
WHY JENN SAW PETER
AND STINKING-DRUNK YOU

21
00:00:40,582 --> 00:00:43,210
UPSTAIRS ALONE
AT 2:00 A.M.

22
00:00:43,293 --> 00:00:45,087
I TOLD YOU
I LIKED HIM.

23
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:46,463
HEY, HEY, OKAY.

24
00:00:46,964 --> 00:00:49,800
YOU TELL ME HE'S HANDS-OFF
AND HE'S HANDS-OFF.

25
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:51,677
THAT'S JUST THE LAW.

26
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:53,720
LIKE GIRLS SCOUT HONOUR.

27
00:00:53,804 --> 00:00:54,972
SHUT UP!

28
00:00:55,848 --> 00:00:57,140
MANNY:
I'M A SAILOR.

29
00:00:57,224 --> 00:00:59,142
(LOUD CRASH AND SCREAM)

30
00:01:01,436 --> 00:01:02,354
EMMA:
OH, MY GOD.

31
00:01:05,482 --> 00:01:06,817
SIMPSON:
OH MANNY.

32
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:09,444
YOU CAN BE MY TASTE-TESTER
FOR MY FRIDGE-DUMP OMELETTE.

33
00:01:09,528 --> 00:01:12,030
WE'VE GOT ZUCCHINI,
SAUSAGE,

34
00:01:12,114 --> 00:01:15,117
THE CRUMBLY END OF A BIG OLD
HUNK OF BLUE CHEESE.

35
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,411
COLD CEREAL
IS OUR FRIEND.

36
00:01:17,494 --> 00:01:18,912
NO, NO THANK YOU.

37
00:01:18,996 --> 00:01:20,539
I'M FINE.

38
00:01:20,622 --> 00:01:20,873
OH...

39
00:01:22,124 --> 00:01:23,166
GUESS WHO JUST HUNG UP

40
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:24,668
FROM A CONVERSATION
WITH YOUR MOM?

41
00:01:25,669 --> 00:01:26,712
GREAT.

42
00:01:26,795 --> 00:01:27,462
WHO NEARLY WEPT

43
00:01:27,546 --> 00:01:28,422
WHEN SHE HEARD
THAT YOU WERE HERE,

44
00:01:28,505 --> 00:01:29,214
SAFE AND SOUND.

45
00:01:29,298 --> 00:01:32,176
I HATE HER.
I HATE THEM.

SURE.

59
00:02:23,227 --> 00:02:24,186
I WASN'T DRINKING.

60
00:02:24,269 --> 00:02:25,145
OH, GOOD.

61
00:02:25,229 --> 00:02:26,313
THEN YOU REMEMBER
WHAT HAPPENED

62
00:02:26,396 --> 00:02:29,483
BECAUSE I'M STILL
A LITTLE FOGGY.

63
00:02:29,566 --> 00:02:31,610
YEAH,
I REMEMBER EVERYTHING.

64
00:02:31,693 --> 00:02:33,737
ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU
SHOWED ME YOUR...

65
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:35,072
YOU KNOW.

66
00:02:38,242 --> 00:02:39,993
BUT YOU WERE SOBER.

67
00:02:40,077 --> 00:02:42,204
WHY DIDN'T YOU TRY
AND STOP ME?

68
00:02:42,287 --> 00:02:44,039
BECAUSE YOUR REQUEST
"LET'S MAKE A LITTLE MOVIE"

69
00:02:44,122 --> 00:02:47,125
IMPLIED YOU DIDN'T
WANT ME TO.

70
00:02:48,043 --> 00:02:49,920
WHY ARE YOU
BEING LIKE THIS?

71
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:51,547
I WANNA SEE YOU AGAIN.

72
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:54,216
PETER, MY BEST FRIEND
SINCE DAYCARE LIKES YOU

73
00:02:54,299 --> 00:02:56,009
AND SHE'S REALLY LOVELY.

74
00:02:56,093 --> 00:02:57,302
YEAH,
BUT SHE'S NOT YOU.

75
00:02:57,386 --> 00:02:59,221
LAST NIGHT
WAS WHAT IT WAS

76
00:02:59,304 --> 00:03:00,222
AND NOTHING MORE.

77
00:03:00,305 --> 00:03:04,852
AND I'M GONNA TRUST YOU
THAT IT STAYS BETWEEN US.

78
00:03:07,563 --> 00:03:09,898
FIRST CHANCE I GET
I'LL ERASE EVERYTHING.

79
00:03:10,691 --> 00:03:12,860
IT'LL BE
OUR LITTLE SECRET.

80
00:03:24,788 --> 00:03:27,541
MARCO:
SO YOU AND CRAIG
ARE BEST FRIENDS ALL SUMMER...

81
00:03:27,624 --> 00:03:28,792
REGRETTABLY.

82
00:03:28,876 --> 00:03:30,460
AND YOU DEVELOP
A CUTE LITTLE CRUSH.

83
00:03:30,544 --> 00:03:31,086
MARCO...

84
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:32,546
AND HE SAYS A FEW
MEAN WORDS TO YOU-

85
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:33,297
TWO.

86
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:34,506
HE SAID TWO MEAN WORDS

87
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:37,050
AFTER I BUST MY KILT
TO THROW HIM A PARTY.

88
00:03:37,134 --> 00:03:39,428
SO WHAT?
WE'RE NOT GOING TO HANG OUT?

89
00:03:39,511 --> 00:03:42,014
NOT UNTIL HE APOLOGIZES.

90
00:03:43,473 --> 00:03:44,057
OKAY.

91
00:03:44,141 --> 00:03:47,019
LOOK, WE HAVE BAND PRACTICE
SCHEDULED FOR TOMORROW NIGHT.

92
00:03:47,102 --> 00:03:49,646
DIDN'T CRAIG SAY HE'D NEVER
LET SPINNER BACK IN THE BAND?

93
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:50,397
HE HASN'T,

94
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,482
AND SPINNER ISN'T.

95
00:03:52,983 --> 00:03:56,028
WHICH LEAVES US
WITHOUT A DRUMMER.

96
00:03:56,111 --> 00:03:57,154
HEY...

97
00:03:57,237 --> 00:03:59,156
I JUST STARTED
DRUMMING AGAIN.

98
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:01,325
I HAVEN'T DRUMMED
SINCE I WAS LIKE, TEN.

99
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:02,326
YEAH,
BUT YOU KNOW HOW TO DRUM -

100
00:04:02,409 --> 00:04:03,911
AN IMMEDIATE IMPROVEMENT
OVER SPINNER -

101
00:04:03,994 --> 00:04:06,371
AND YOU HAVE BEEN
IN A BAND BEFORE.

102
00:04:06,455 --> 00:04:07,664
SO MAYBE IT'S TIME

103
00:04:07,748 --> 00:04:11,084
YOU THINK ABOUT
JOINING A NEW ONE.

104
00:04:12,127 --> 00:04:12,961
EMMA:
YOU TOLD HIM

105
00:04:13,045 --> 00:04:14,505
I LIKED HIM?!

106
00:04:14,588 --> 00:04:15,756
SORT OF.

107
00:04:16,548 --> 00:04:19,259
SO, NOW, INSTEAD OF JUST BEING
TONGUE-TIED IN FRONT OF HIM,

108
00:04:19,343 --> 00:04:21,261
I WILL ACTUALLY HAVE
TO BARF ON HIS SHOES.

109
00:04:21,345 --> 00:04:21,845
NO, NO...

110
00:04:21,929 --> 00:04:24,139
I... I THINK HE WAS
KIND OF INTO YOU.

111
00:04:24,223 --> 00:04:26,850
I MEAN, I TOLD HIM THAT YOU-
YOU WERE LOVELY.

112
00:04:28,018 --> 00:04:28,644
REALLY?

113
00:04:29,937 --> 00:04:32,689
WELL, SORRY I WAS SNOTTY
EARLIER.

114
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:36,026
YOU ARE SO GOOD!

115
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:36,735
(WHISPERING)
MANNY?

116
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:41,114
YOUR MOTHER'S HERE
TO SEE YOU.

117
00:04:46,245 --> 00:04:47,621
I COULDN'T COME HOME,
MOM.

118
00:04:47,704 --> 00:04:49,331
NOT AFTER LAST NIGHT.

119
00:04:49,414 --> 00:04:51,750
SO YOU DECIDED TO MAKE
YOUR FATHER'S TEMPER EVEN WORSE?

120
00:04:52,835 --> 00:04:54,461
MANNY:
I'M THE ONE
WHO SHOULD BE ANGRY.

121
00:04:54,545 --> 00:04:56,713
HE CALLED ME A SLUT.

122
00:04:59,883 --> 00:05:03,053
UNTIL YOU SWEAR
TO DO WHAT HE SAYS,

123
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:04,805
AND GIVE UP ACTING,

124
00:05:04,888 --> 00:05:06,515
YOUR FATHER'S TEMPER
WILL ONLY GET WORSE.

125
00:05:06,598 --> 00:05:08,642
HE'LL GET MORE ANGRY.

126
00:05:08,725 --> 00:05:10,227
I CAN'T.

127
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:11,311
I WON'T.

128
00:05:11,395 --> 00:05:13,897
MRS. SANTOS:
THEN... YOU CAN STAY AT EMMA'S?

129
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:16,900
I'M SURE IT'S
NOT A PROBLEM.

130
00:05:19,278 --> 00:05:21,572
SO I CAN'T COME HOME?

131
00:05:22,447 --> 00:05:23,115
NOT YET.

132
00:05:23,991 --> 00:05:25,450
NOT UNTIL YOU ARE READY.

133
00:05:29,204 --> 00:05:32,499
MS. KWAN:
A SMART READER USES STRATEGIES
BEFORE SHE READS,

134
00:05:32,583 --> 00:05:34,168
TO PREVIEW THE TEXT

135
00:05:35,252 --> 00:05:38,797
AND TO ACTIVATE THEIR PRIOR
KNOWLEDGE OF THE TOPIC.

136
00:05:38,881 --> 00:05:41,925
A SMART READER ALSO TRACKS
AND REPORTS IDEAS

137
00:05:42,009 --> 00:05:44,178
AS THEY READ THEM.

138
00:05:44,261 --> 00:05:47,556
SMART READERS ALSO KNOW
THAT READING PLAYS...

139
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:49,183
STOP STARING.

140
00:05:49,266 --> 00:05:51,268
STOP BEING AN ASS.

141
00:05:52,436 --> 00:05:54,646
DO YOU KNOW
HOW HUMILIATING IT WAS

142
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:57,316
TO FIND OUT IN PUBLIC

143
00:05:57,399 --> 00:06:01,278
THAT MY GIRLFRIEND DUMPED ME
BY EMAIL?

144
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:02,029
OH...

145
00:06:02,112 --> 00:06:04,114
OH, YOU'RE FORGETTING
ON YOUR BIRTHDAY.

146
00:06:04,198 --> 00:06:07,451
THAT'S A PRETTY GOOD
DETAIL, TOO.

147
00:06:08,452 --> 00:06:10,078
ASHLEY WANTED TO TELL YOU
HERSELF.

148
00:06:10,162 --> 00:06:12,122
SHE WANTED TO WAIT
TILL THE TIME WAS RIGHT.

149
00:06:12,206 --> 00:06:14,458
SHE WAS... CONCERNED.

150
00:06:15,459 --> 00:06:19,129
THAT I'D GO OFF MY MEDS
AND GO ALL CRAZY.

151
00:06:19,213 --> 00:06:20,380
I'M FINE.
YOU KNOW I'M FINE.

152
00:06:20,464 --> 00:06:22,883
WE HUNG OUT
ALL SUMMER.

153
00:06:22,966 --> 00:06:26,386
AND I DON'T NEED YOU
PROTECTING ME.

154
00:06:27,721 --> 00:06:30,057
ALL THIS ANGER
IS FOR ASHLEY.

155
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:31,683
BUY A TICKET,
GO TO LONDON

156
00:06:31,767 --> 00:06:33,560
AND FREAK ON HER
THERE.

157
00:06:33,644 --> 00:06:34,645
(BELL RINGS)

158
00:06:56,542 --> 00:06:57,960
LOOKING FOR THIS?

159
00:07:01,004 --> 00:07:02,047
SO WHEN ARE WE GOING OUT?

160
00:07:02,589 --> 00:07:04,424
THIS ISN'T FUNNY ANYMORE.

161
00:07:05,175 --> 00:07:07,052
YOU DIDN'T ANSWER
MY QUESTION.

162
00:07:07,135 --> 00:07:08,470
WHEN ARE WE GOING OUT?

163
00:07:08,554 --> 00:07:11,807
PETER, I AM NEVER GOING
TO GO OUT WITH YOU!

164
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:13,058
I DON'T LIKE YOU.

165
00:07:13,141 --> 00:07:16,645
TO TELL THE TRUTH,
I THINK YOU'RE A FREAK.

166
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:22,568
JUST...

167
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:25,737
JUST I NEED-
I NEED THE TAPE BACK, OKAY?

168
00:07:26,488 --> 00:07:27,239
NEVER TELL THE SHOPKEEPER

169
00:07:27,322 --> 00:07:29,783
YOU'RE DESPERATE
TO BUY HIS MERCHANDISE.

170
00:07:29,867 --> 00:07:31,243
'CAUSE NOW
MY PRICE JUST WENT UP.

171
00:07:31,326 --> 00:07:32,035
WHAT?

172
00:07:32,119 --> 00:07:34,037
PETER:
THERE'S A NEW CAMERA I WANT.

173
00:07:34,121 --> 00:07:34,955
HDV 10 ADI.

174
00:07:36,206 --> 00:07:37,583
RUNS ABOUT THREE THOUSAND.

175
00:07:37,666 --> 00:07:39,877
I DON'T HAVE
THAT KIND OF MONEY.

176
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:40,627
YOU LIE.

177
00:07:40,711 --> 00:07:44,214
PLASTIC SURGERY AIN'T COVERED
BY HEALTH CARE, HONEY.

178
00:07:44,298 --> 00:07:46,925
BUT... MY CREDIT CARD

354
00:16:04,047 --> 00:16:06,258
IT'S NOT THE JOB
FOR A DECENT GIRL.

355
00:16:06,341 --> 00:16:07,718
IT IS TOO!

356
00:16:08,218 --> 00:16:09,261
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT!

357
00:16:09,344 --> 00:16:09,720
ENOUGH!

358
00:16:12,598 --> 00:16:15,017
YOU WILL DO WHAT I SAY!

359
00:16:16,518 --> 00:16:17,186
I CAN'T.

360
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:19,938
YOU CAN'T ASK ME!

361
00:16:25,194 --> 00:16:26,862
YOU TELL HER.

362
00:16:28,697 --> 00:16:30,407
YOU TELL THAT GIRL

363
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:32,201
THIS IS NO LONGER
HER HOME.

364
00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:34,036
JOSEPH!

365
00:16:34,578 --> 00:16:36,538

YOU HERE TO SEE MARCO?
HE'S NOT HERE YET.

368
00:16:53,388 --> 00:16:54,389

372
00:17:00,687 --> 00:17:01,813
WE HUNG OUT ALL SUMMER

373
00:17:01,897 --> 00:17:03,232
AND I KNOW YOU'RE OKAY NOW.

374
00:17:03,315 --> 00:17:05,400
AND IT WAS SO...

375
00:17:05,484 --> 00:17:08,570
SO STUPID OF ME
TO TRY AND PROTECT YOU.

376
00:17:10,322 --> 00:17:12,491
I SHOULD'VE JUST TOLD YOU.

377
00:17:13,075 --> 00:17:14,034
SORRY.

378
00:17:14,117 --> 00:17:14,535
COOL.

379
00:17:16,245 --> 00:17:17,162

CRAIG:
THAT'S IT.

381
00:17:24,211 --> 00:17:26,171
I... (SIGHS)
I CAN FEEL THEM, YOU KNOW.

382
00:17:26,255 --> 00:17:29,758
YOUR EYES BURNING A HOLE
IN MY BACK.

383
00:17:32,636 --> 00:17:33,804
I'M SORRY... TOO.

384
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:38,725
I OVERREACTED, OKAY?

385
00:17:40,102 --> 00:17:41,687
SO... THERE.

386
00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:42,813
BETTER?

387
00:17:43,814 --> 00:17:44,773
NOT REALLY.

388
00:17:45,482 --> 00:17:46,483
SO WHAT DO WE DO?

389
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:47,568
WELL...

390
00:17:49,236 --> 00:17:51,488
I HEARD YOU'RE
IN-BETWEEN DRUMMERS.

391
00:17:51,572 --> 00:17:53,657
YOU HEARD RIGHT.
KNOW ANY?

392
00:17:54,157 --> 00:17:56,076
I HAPPEN TO BE
IN-BETWEEN BANDS.

393
00:17:57,119 --> 00:17:58,287
MAYBE I SHOULD SIT IN?

394
00:18:01,707 --> 00:18:03,208
I GOTTA WARN YOU, EL.

395
00:18:03,292 --> 00:18:04,960
WE SUCK - HUGE.

396

OLDEST RULE OF MUSIC,
CRAIG.

397
00:18:07,671 --> 00:18:10,757
A BAND'S ONLY AS GOOD
AS ITS DRUMMER.

398
00:18:12,134 --> 00:18:12,968
(DRUMMING)

399
00:18:21,685 --> 00:18:23,103
OKAY,
YOU'LL FIT IN FINE.

400
00:18:35,407 --> 00:18:37,743
EM, JUST HEAR ME OUT.

401
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:44,082
HERE ARE THE CLOTHES
THAT YOU LENT ME.

402
00:18:44,166 --> 00:18:46,502
I KNOW I HAVE OTHER STUFF
OF YOURS TOO, BUT...

403
00:18:46,585 --> 00:18:48,670
YOU PROBABLY LOST IT ALL.

404
00:18:49,630 --> 00:18:51,340
BUT I GOT KICKED OUT.

405
00:18:52,549 --> 00:18:54,343
I DON'T KNOW FOR HOW LONG.

406
00:18:54,426 --> 00:18:55,677
MAYBE FOR GOOD.

407
00:18:58,347 --> 00:19:00,432
EM, I SCREWED UP...
SO BAD.

408
00:19:02,935 --> 00:19:04,353
I LOST MY FAMILY,

409
00:19:05,604 --> 00:19:06,772
MY REPUTATION,

410
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:09,399
AND MY BEST FRIEND.

411
00:19:10,359 --> 00:19:11,276
JUST WAIT.

412
00:19:14,321 --> 00:19:17,658
MANNY, IT'S HARD
TO WATCH YOU SOMETIMES.

413
00:19:17,741 --> 00:19:19,409
YOU HAVE EVERYTHING
GOING FOR YOU

414
00:19:19,493 --> 00:19:20,911
AND YOU JUST...

415
00:19:20,994 --> 00:19:23,830
YOU KEEP SCREWING IT UP
PRETTY SPECTACULARLY.

416
00:19:23,914 --> 00:19:26,542
IT'D BE EASIER
IF I WAS YOU, EM.

417
00:19:26,625 --> 00:19:28,126
SKINNY, BLONDE...

418
00:19:28,919 --> 00:19:30,420
MANNY,
THAT IS A BUNCH OF CRAP

419
00:19:30,504 --> 00:19:31,547
AND YOU KNOW IT.

420
00:19:31,630 --> 00:19:34,132
THAT IS NOT
WHAT THIS IS ABOUT.

LOOK,
JUST SO YOU KNOW,

427
00:20:09,585 --> 00:20:10,586
I DIDN'T SEND IT
TO THE WHOLE WORLD.

428
00:20:10,669 --> 00:20:11,670
I JUST SHOWED IT
TO A COUPLE OF FRIENDS.

429
00:20:11,753 --> 00:20:14,047
REMIND ME
TO THANK YOU.

432
00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:19,094
DON'T USE THAT TONE OF VOICE
WITH ME HERE.

433
00:20:19,178 --> 00:20:22,055
THIS IS MY SCHOOL,
I AM YOUR PRINCIPAL.

434
00:20:22,139 --> 00:20:23,724
IN MY OFFICE.

435
00:20:23,807 --> 00:20:24,641

(SIGHS)

437
00:20:32,065 --> 00:20:33,567
I'M SO ASHAMED,
I CANNOT EVEN LOOK AT YOU.

438
00:20:33,650 --> 00:20:34,693
WHAT WERE YOU THINKING?

439
00:20:34,776 --> 00:20:36,403
HOW COULD YOU DO
SOMETHING SO HEARTLESS?

440
00:20:36,778 --> 00:20:39,740
DID YOU KNOW
HE'S HATZILAKOS' SON?

441
00:20:39,823 --> 00:20:41,742
NO.
HE DIDN'T TELL ME.

442
00:20:41,825 --> 00:20:44,494
I DON'T THINK
HE TOLD ANYONE.

443
00:20:44,578 --> 00:20:45,871
I WONDER WHO
HIS FATHER IS?

444
00:20:45,954 --> 00:20:47,623

446
00:20:55,756 --> 00:20:57,549
MANNY, I KNOW YOU'RE GOING
THROUGH HELL RIGHT NOW

447
00:20:57,633 --> 00:20:59,510
AND I DON'T WANT
TO ADD TO IT,

448
00:20:59,593 --> 00:21:02,179
BUT YOU AND I NEED
SOME GROUND RULES.

449
00:21:02,262 --> 00:21:03,764

I DON'T MEAN
THAT STUFF.

456
00:21:12,105 --> 00:21:14,358
I MEAN

NO MORE LIES EVER,
OKAY?

458
00:21:17,694 --> 00:21:20,405
THERE WILL BE NOTHING
BETWEEN US.
