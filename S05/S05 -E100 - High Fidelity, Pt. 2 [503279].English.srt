00:00:02,628 --> 00:00:03,921
THEN THE RED LIGHTS,
THEY COME UP,

3
00:00:04,004 --> 00:00:05,506
HITTING DARCY

MY-MY MIND IS JUST
PREOCCUPIED THIS MORNING.

00:00:15,641 --> 00:00:18,852
WHAT? HOT DATE

00:00:18,936 --> 00:00:20,312

11
00:00:20,395 --> 00:00:24,566
YET STRANGELY MOVING
RE-VIRGINIZING CEREMONY?

12
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:27,027
DEPENDS.
WOULD YOU DEFINE "HOT DATE"

13
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:28,612
AS BRUTAL FIGHT
AND BREAK UP?

14
00:00:29,446 --> 00:00:31,156
NO, I WOULDN'T.

15
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:33,200

16
00:00:33,283 --> 00:00:36,370
LAST NIGHT,
AFTER THE BREAK UP...

17
00:00:36,453 --> 00:00:37,829
I KISSED SOMEBODY.

18
00:00:37,913 --> 00:00:40,582
SOMEBODY WHO WASN'T DARCY.

19
00:00:41,375 --> 00:00:42,000
HEY, GUYS.

00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:49,299

00:00:49,383 --> 00:00:50,843
SPINNER:
OF COURSE I KNOW
YOUR NAME, PAIGE.

25
00:00:50,926 --> 00:00:51,885
I KNOW TONS ABOUT YOU.

26
00:00:51,969 --> 00:00:53,136

30
00:00:58,851 --> 00:01:00,519
TAKE IT FROM SOMEONE

00:01:00,602 --> 00:01:04,147
TOKING BEFORE SCHOOL
ENDS IN TRAGEDY.

32
00:01:05,274 --> 00:01:07,901

PAIGE...

58
00:02:37,741 --> 00:02:38,784

62
00:02:44,289 --> 00:02:46,375
LAST NIGHT, I UM...

63
00:02:46,458 --> 00:02:49,294
I MIGHT'VE MADE OUT
WITH SPINNER...

64
00:02:49,378 --> 00:02:50,838
A LITTLE BIT.

65
00:02:50,921 --> 00:02:52,005
SPINNER?

66
00:02:52,089 --> 00:02:55,509
BUT I JUST GOT USED TO YOU
BEING A LESBIAN!

67
00:02:55,592 --> 00:02:57,636
THIS ISN'T ABOUT YOU,
IT'S ABOUT ME.

68
00:02:57,719 --> 00:03:00,347
AND RIGHT NOW I'M ABOUT
BEING FREE TO DATE

69
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:01,348

00:03:01,431 --> 00:03:02,933

YOU LOOK GREAT.

86
00:03:45,475 --> 00:03:46,435
SO YOU'RE HERE.

87
00:03:46,518 --> 00:03:48,896
AH, DID YOU FINALLY
GET TIRED OF LONDON OR...?

88
00:03:48,979 --> 00:03:50,314
I COULD NEVER GET TIRED
OF LONDON.

89
00:03:50,397 --> 00:03:52,983
MM, YOU KNOW, BUT I GOT TIRED
OF MISSING HOME.

90
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:53,734
TRIED SOME SCHOOLS THERE,

91
00:03:53,817 --> 00:03:56,570
BUT COULDN'T FIND ANYTHING
QUITE LIKE THIS.

92
00:03:56,653 --> 00:03:58,405
YEAH, GUESS IT'S,
IT'S KINDA HARD TO FIND

93
00:03:58,488 --> 00:03:59,740
A SCHOOL WITH...

94
00:03:59,823 --> 00:04:02,409
SUCH A UNIQUE COMBO
OF SHOOTINGS

95
00:04:02,492 --> 00:04:04,286
AND GONORRHEA OUTBREAKS.

96
00:04:04,369 --> 00:04:05,537
(LAUGHS)

97
00:04:05,621 --> 00:04:07,497
OKAY, YEAH, SOME BAD
STUFF'S HAPPENED HERE.

98
00:04:07,581 --> 00:04:10,083
BUT THERE'S SOME GOOD
PEOPLE HERE TOO,

99
00:04:10,167 --> 00:04:11,376
LIKE JIMMY BROOKS.

100
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:13,086
OH, WELL,
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

101
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:14,296
BUT DON'T GET USED TO HIM

102
00:04:14,379 --> 00:04:17,257
BECAUSE I'M GONNA BE
OUTTIE NEXT YEAR,

103
00:04:17,341 --> 00:04:18,634
HOPEFULLY.

104
00:04:18,717 --> 00:04:19,635
MM, THAT'S TOO BAD.

105
00:04:19,718 --> 00:04:21,762
I WAS KINDA HOPING WE COULD
BE CLASSMATES AGAIN.

106
00:04:21,845 --> 00:04:22,763
I WAS TALKING
TO MS. HATZILAKOS

107
00:04:22,846 --> 00:04:25,557
ABOUT MAYBE COMING BACK
NEXT YEAR.

108
00:04:25,641 --> 00:04:27,142
MS. KERWIN'S BACK
IN TOWN.

109
00:04:27,226 --> 00:04:28,268
HEY!

110
00:04:28,352 --> 00:04:30,062
HEY, JIMMY,
SHE'S ALL YOURS.

111
00:04:30,145 --> 00:04:32,606
OKAY. UM, WE GOTTA
CATCH UP LATER.

112
00:04:32,689 --> 00:04:33,899
OKAY?

113
00:04:33,982 --> 00:04:35,943
SO, I HAVE TO CONGRATULATE YOU,
JIMMY.

114
00:04:36,026 --> 00:04:38,111
YOU'VE PUT A LOT OF WORK
IN THIS YEAR.

115
00:04:38,195 --> 00:04:40,572
WELL,
THANK YOU, MS. H.

116
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,324
LIKE COACH SAYS,

117
00:04:42,407 --> 00:04:44,493
YOU KNOW, IT'S IMPORTANT
TO BE MOTIVATED

118
00:04:44,576 --> 00:04:47,454
AND (SIGHS) I WAS
DEFINITELY MOTIVATED.

119
00:04:47,538 --> 00:04:48,163
MM HMM.

120
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:50,707
JIMMY:
IT'S REALLY-
IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT FOR ME

121
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:53,043
TO GRADUATE THIS YEAR.

122
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:57,631
AND UH, I KNOW I MISSED
A LOT OF SCHOOL FOR PHYSIO,

123
00:04:57,714 --> 00:05:00,175
BUT I FIGURED
THERE WAS SOME WAY

124
00:05:00,259 --> 00:05:01,593
YOU COULD SWING THIS.

125
00:05:03,387 --> 00:05:05,013
I'M SORRY, JIMMY.

126
00:05:05,097 --> 00:05:08,183
YOU SIMPLY DON'T
HAVE THE CREDITS.

127
00:05:08,267 --> 00:05:10,561
I CAN'T WORK MIRACLES.

128
00:05:19,695 --> 00:05:22,114
SPINNER:
HEY, LOOKS LIKE YOU COULD
USE A HAND.

129
00:05:22,197 --> 00:05:23,824
JIMMY:
I'M FINE, THANKS.

130
00:05:23,907 --> 00:05:25,117
I SAID, I'M FINE.
THANK YOU.

131
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:27,995
JUST WANTED TO HELP,
MAN.

132
00:05:28,078 --> 00:05:29,496
JIMMY:
YOU WANNA HELP ME?

133
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:31,123
WHY DON'T YOU TRANSFER
TO ANOTHER SCHOOL

134
00:05:31,206 --> 00:05:33,292
SO I DON'T HAVE TO SEE
YOUR STUPID FACE NEXT YEAR.

135
00:05:33,375 --> 00:05:34,835
THAT WOULD HELP -
A LITTLE BIT.

136
00:05:36,044 --> 00:05:37,254
WHAT IS YOUR DAMAGE, MAN?

137
00:05:38,589 --> 00:05:40,966
MY DAMAGE, MAN,

140
00:05:46,305 --> 00:05:47,890
WITHOUT ANYMORE DRAMA?

141
00:05:47,973 --> 00:05:48,765
ASK HIM THAT.

MOST OF THE OLD GANG:
JIMMY. PAIGE, HAZEL.

153
00:06:10,495 --> 00:06:11,747
NO SIGN OF CRAIG,

154
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:13,373
HE'S IN VANCOUVER.

155
00:06:13,457 --> 00:06:16,418

DON'T BE SO SURE.

159
00:06:22,174 --> 00:06:23,550
HE'S DATING MANNY.

160
00:06:23,634 --> 00:06:26,470
EW! THAT MAKES ME
VAGUELY ITCHY.

161
00:06:26,553 --> 00:06:27,638
ME TOO!

162
00:06:28,972 --> 00:06:31,391
OF COURSE IT COULD
JUST BE LABEL CHAFE,

AH, IT WAS GOOD,

168
00:06:39,066 --> 00:06:39,942
AND THEN IT WAS BAD,

169
00:06:40,025 --> 00:06:41,652
AND THEN IT WAS OVER.

170
00:06:41,735 --> 00:06:42,945

00:15:43,402 --> 00:15:45,362
IT'S YOUR GIFT.

357
00:15:45,445 --> 00:15:46,655
HEY, IT DIDN'T COME.

358
00:15:46,738 --> 00:15:49,950
I'VE BEEN TEXTING BACK
AND FORTH WITH THE GUY

359
00:15:50,033 --> 00:15:53,203
AND HE JUST BAILED,
THE JERK.

360
00:15:53,287 --> 00:15:56,748
SEEING AS I HAVE TO WAIT
THE WHOLE SUMMER...

361
00:15:56,832 --> 00:16:01,253
MAYBE YOU COULD GIVE ME
THE TEENSIEST OF HINTS?

362
00:16:03,297 --> 00:16:06,884
GOOD THINGS COME
TO THOSE WHO WAIT.

363
00:16:06,967 --> 00:16:09,887
I'M GONNA GET US
SOME DRINKS.

364
00:16:14,308 --> 00:16:14,933
(SIGHS)

365
00:16:25,068 --> 00:16:26,486
ASHLEY:
JIMMY! JIMMY, WAIT.

366
00:16:26,570 --> 00:16:27,404
I'M SORRY!

367
00:16:27,487 --> 00:16:28,697
PLEASE,
THIS IS ALL MY FAULT.

368
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:30,532
LOOK ASHLEY, IT'S FINE.
REALLY. OKAY?

369
00:16:30,616 --> 00:16:32,701
NO. JIMMY. JIMMY!

370
00:16:32,784 --> 00:16:34,411
IT'S NOT.
LOOK...

371
00:16:34,494 --> 00:16:35,996
YOU'RE AN AMAZING GUY.

372
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:38,749
YOU DESERVE TO BE WITH
SOMEONE WHO ADORES YOU.

373
00:16:38,832 --> 00:16:41,877
LOOK I'M GONNA LET YOU IN
ON A SECRET.

374
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:45,464
GIRLS DON'T DIG GUYS
IN WHEELCHAIRS.

375
00:16:57,726 --> 00:16:59,061
YOU WERE SAYING?

376
00:17:04,316 --> 00:17:07,152
(DANCE MUSIC)
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

377
00:17:13,367 --> 00:17:15,994
I WANTED TO KNOW
WHAT MY GIFT WAS.

378
00:17:16,078 --> 00:17:19,248
DARCE, YOU DIDN'T
READ MY TEXTS?

379
00:17:19,831 --> 00:17:20,916

SOME GIFT,
SPINNER.

381
00:17:23,252 --> 00:17:24,419
SPECIAL.

382
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:34,972
YOU SUCK.

383
00:17:44,064 --> 00:17:45,232
MARCO:
AND NOW,

384
00:17:45,315 --> 00:17:48,443
AS WE HEAD OFF
IN EVERY DIRECTION,

385
00:17:48,527 --> 00:17:49,778
LET US REMEMBER THE TIES

386
00:17:49,862 --> 00:17:51,405
WE HAVE TO EACH OTHER

387
00:17:51,488 --> 00:17:53,490
AND TO DEGRASSI.

388
00:17:53,574 --> 00:17:55,409
BECAUSE THE BEST THING
ABOUT THE PAST

389
00:17:55,492 --> 00:17:56,535
IS THAT IT'S JUST-

390
00:17:56,618 --> 00:17:58,453
IT'S HUGE PART OF THE FUTURE,
SO...

391
00:17:58,537 --> 00:17:59,746
TO THE FUTURE.

392
00:17:59,830 --> 00:18:01,081
TO US.

393
00:18:01,164 --> 00:18:02,833
WE DID IT GUYS!
(LAUGHS)

394
00:18:02,916 --> 00:18:03,750
(APPLAUSE)

395
00:18:09,089 --> 00:18:11,925
MS. HATZILAKOS:

396
00:18:12,009 --> 00:18:13,677
AND NOW,
WITHOUT FURTHER ADO,

397
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:15,888
I'D LIKE TO WELCOME

ONTO A BRIGHT FUTURE.

405
00:18:39,369 --> 00:18:42,164
YOU SHOULD'VE BEEN UP
THERE, MAN.

406
00:18:42,247 --> 00:18:45,626
IT'LL BE OUR TURN
NEXT YEAR, RIGHT?

407
00:18:45,709 --> 00:18:46,835
I'M SORRY,

408
00:18:46,919 --> 00:18:48,962
ARE WE ACTUALLY
HAVING A CONVERSATION?

409
00:18:49,046 --> 00:18:51,590
MS. HATZILAKOS:
CHRIS HENDERSON...

410
00:18:51,673 --> 00:18:53,258
LOOK UM...

411
00:18:53,342 --> 00:18:55,511

AND UM,

415
00:19:02,976 --> 00:19:03,727
AND I'M SORRY.

416
00:19:04,895 --> 00:19:06,730
JIMMY, I DO-

417
00:19:06,813 --> 00:19:09,733
IT'S COOL. I KNOW.
(CHUCKLES)

418
00:19:13,529 --> 00:19:14,363
I GOTTA GO.
