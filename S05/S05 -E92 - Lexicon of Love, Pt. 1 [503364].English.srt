SO...

162
00:05:48,432 --> 00:05:51,018
AND WHEN I SAY
A LITTLE BIT I MEAN...

163
00:05:51,101 --> 00:05:52,477
COMPLETELY.

164
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:55,606
WAS I THAT BAD?!

165
00:05:56,273 --> 00:05:57,733

00:06:01,486 --> 00:06:03,572
STUFF, YOU KNOW,
HITS THE EDITING ROOM FLOOR.

169
00:06:03,655 --> 00:06:04,448
WHEN I WAS DOING
"JERSEY GIRL",

170
00:06:04,531 --> 00:06:06,450
I CUT J-LO OUT OF HALF
THE MOVE.

171
00:06:06,533 --> 00:06:08,035
AFFLECK, I WANTED
TO CUT HIM OUT ENTIRELY

172
00:06:08,118 --> 00:06:09,536
BUT THEN THAT JUST WOULD'VE
LEFT THAT LITTLE KID,

173
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:10,245
YOU KNOW?

174
00:06:10,329 --> 00:06:12,206
I DIDN'T SEE
"JERSEY GIRL".

354
00:15:02,236 --> 00:15:02,986
HI!

355
00:15:04,696 --> 00:15:06,782
SO, THIS NEW LESBIAN THING
YOU GOT GOING ON...

356
00:15:08,909 --> 00:15:10,160
I LIKE TO WATCH.

357
00:15:10,244 --> 00:15:13,038
I LIKE TO PUNCH.
DREAM ON.

358
00:15:13,121 --> 00:15:15,499
LEXI...
LEXI, COME ON.

359
00:15:15,582 --> 00:15:16,458
WHY WEREN'T YOU
THIS ADVENTUROUS

360
00:15:16,542 --> 00:15:17,835
WHILE WE WERE DATING,
HUH?

361
00:15:17,918 --> 00:15:19,253
WE COULD'VE HAD FUN.

362
00:15:19,336 --> 00:15:20,671
YOU'RE DISGUSTING.

363
00:15:20,754 --> 00:15:22,256
OH, AND YOU?

364
00:15:22,339 --> 00:15:24,299
PUTTING ON A SHOW
FOR EVERYONE?

365
00:15:24,383 --> 00:15:25,717
(CHUCKLES)

366
00:15:26,301 --> 00:15:26,844
YOU KNOW,
WHAT MAKES YOU THINK

367
00:15:26,927 --> 00:15:29,763
TONIGHT IS ABOUT YOU,
ANYWAYS?

368
00:15:29,847 --> 00:15:31,932
IT'S NOT.
IT'S ABOUT HER.

369
00:15:35,185 --> 00:15:35,978
HERE.

370
00:15:36,061 --> 00:15:36,770
THANK YOU.

371
00:15:36,854 --> 00:15:39,189
LET ME WALK
YOU HOME.

372
00:15:39,273 --> 00:15:40,357
BUT MY SHOES!

373
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,233
BAREFOOT SUITS YOU.

374
00:15:41,316 --> 00:15:44,736
AND BESIDES,
MY PLACE IS ON THE WAY.

375
00:15:53,912 --> 00:15:54,830
MY MOM AND HER BOYFRIEND
ARE HOME

376
00:15:54,913 --> 00:15:56,206
SO JUST WAIT
BY THE DOOR.

377
00:15:56,290 --> 00:15:57,040
OH, BUT I'M THIRSTY.

378
00:15:57,124 --> 00:15:58,417
CAN'T I JUST GET
A DRINK OF WATER?

379
00:15:58,500 --> 00:15:59,751
NO.
I'M GRABBING SHOES

380
00:15:59,835 --> 00:16:01,420
AND THEN WE'RE OUTTA HERE,
IMMEDIATELY.

381
00:16:03,463 --> 00:16:04,464
EMILY:
LEXI?

382
00:16:05,132 --> 00:16:06,091
HEY.

383
00:16:06,758 --> 00:16:08,177
WHO'S YOUR FRIEND?

384
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:10,554
ALEX:
NEVERMIND, MOM.
JUST GRABBING SHOES.

385
00:16:10,637 --> 00:16:12,681
HI, MS. NUNEZ.
I'M PAIGE.

386
00:16:13,348 --> 00:16:14,725
PAIGE...

387
00:16:14,808 --> 00:16:15,642
THE PAIGE?

388
00:16:17,644 --> 00:16:19,271
I FEEL LIKE I'M IN
THE PRESENCE OF ROYALTY.

389
00:16:19,354 --> 00:16:19,980
YOU KNOW THAT LEXI

390
00:16:20,063 --> 00:16:21,440
NEVER STOPS TALKING
ABOUT YOU!

391
00:16:21,523 --> 00:16:22,941
PAIGE:
REALLY? LITTLE OL' ME?

392
00:16:23,025 --> 00:16:24,526
MOM, WHERE'S CHAD?

393
00:16:25,152 --> 00:16:27,696
OH, HE PASSED OUT
HOURS AGO.

394
00:16:27,779 --> 00:16:28,488
COME SIT.

395
00:16:29,114 --> 00:16:30,908
CAN I GET YOU SOMETHING,
DARLING?

396
00:16:30,991 --> 00:16:32,409
PAIGE:
YEAH. DIET ANYTHING, PLEASE.

397
00:16:32,492 --> 00:16:33,744
ALEX:
PAIGE, WE HAVE TO GO.

398
00:16:33,827 --> 00:16:35,078
WOULD YOU HOLD
YOUR HORSES, LEXI,

399
00:16:35,162 --> 00:16:36,413
AND JUST LET THE GIRL
SIT AWHILE!

400
00:16:36,496 --> 00:16:39,374
BE A GOOD HOSTESS
AND GET HER A DRINK, EH.

401
00:16:39,458 --> 00:16:41,793
LOOKS LIKE THE PARTY'S JUST
GETTING STARTED, MS. NUNEZ.

402
00:16:41,877 --> 00:16:43,921
PLEASE,
CALL ME EMILY.

403
00:16:44,004 --> 00:16:45,839
EMILY.
OKAY.

404
00:16:45,923 --> 00:16:49,092
SO WHAT WAS LEXI LIKE
AS A GIRL?

405
00:16:50,344 --> 00:16:53,472
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I CAN'T REMEMBER.

406
00:16:53,555 --> 00:16:54,223
(LAUGHING)

407
00:16:55,516 --> 00:16:56,558
I'M KIDDING.

408
00:16:56,642 --> 00:16:58,560
LEX, I'M KIDDING.

409
00:16:59,770 --> 00:17:02,105
I'M JUST KIDDING,
HON.

410
00:17:10,405 --> 00:17:12,741
EMMA,
WHAT'S GOING ON?

411
00:17:13,408 --> 00:17:15,702
I'M MAKING TEA
AGAIN.

412
00:17:15,786 --> 00:17:17,788
AND CRYING AGAIN.

413
00:17:21,834 --> 00:17:22,793
I LEFT SOMETHING
IN THE THEATRE,

414
00:17:22,876 --> 00:17:23,877
SO I WENT BACK IN
TO GET IT

415
00:17:23,961 --> 00:17:26,088
AND THAT'S WHEN I SAW
YOU AND HER.

416
00:17:26,171 --> 00:17:27,881
MS. HATZILAKOS.

417
00:17:28,632 --> 00:17:29,550
WHAT?

418
00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:33,136
WE-WE WERE JUST TALKING.

419
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:35,889
SNAKE,
I SAW YOU KISS HER.

420
00:17:44,273 --> 00:17:46,358
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY.

421
00:17:49,403 --> 00:17:52,322
IT JUST SORT OF HAPPENED,
YOU KNOW.

422
00:17:53,574 --> 00:17:55,033
IT WAS SUCH A MISTAKE.

423
00:17:55,117 --> 00:17:56,743
SO YOU STICK YOUR TONGUE
DOWN THE PRINCIPAL'S THROAT

424
00:17:56,827 --> 00:17:57,619
BY ACCIDENT?

425
00:17:57,703 --> 00:17:59,079
EMMA, QUIET PLEASE.

426
00:17:59,162 --> 00:18:00,789
YOU GONNA WAKE YOUR MOM.

427
00:18:00,873 --> 00:18:01,540
BUT WHY?

428
00:18:02,749 --> 00:18:03,792
DID YOU THINK
IT WOULD BE FUN?

429
00:18:03,876 --> 00:18:05,252
DID YOU GET TO THE PARTY

430
00:18:05,335 --> 00:18:06,670
AND WANT TO ACT LIKE
A TEENAGER AGAIN?

431
00:18:06,753 --> 00:18:09,006
JUST GIVE ME A REASON, DAD.
PLEASE.

432
00:18:10,090 --> 00:18:11,466
HAVE YOU EVER DONE SOMETHING
YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO

433
00:18:11,550 --> 00:18:13,385
WITH SOMEONE YOU WEREN'T
SUPPOSED TO BE WITH?

434
00:18:19,808 --> 00:18:21,560
EMMA, I'M SO ASHAMED.

435
00:18:24,813 --> 00:18:25,522
I WON'T BLAME YOU

436
00:18:25,606 --> 00:18:26,899
IF YOU NEVER WANT
TO SPEAK TO ME AGAIN.

437
00:18:28,233 --> 00:18:30,068
IT'S NOT ABOUT ME.

438
00:18:30,986 --> 00:18:32,279
IT'S ABOUT MOM,

439
00:18:33,197 --> 00:18:34,948
AND WHETHER I'M GONNA
TELL HER WHAT I SAW.

440
00:18:49,630 --> 00:18:51,006
YOUR MOM GO TO BED?

441
00:18:51,089 --> 00:18:51,673
ALEX:
YEAH.

442
00:18:51,757 --> 00:18:52,799
SHE SAID TO SAY GOODNIGHT.

443
00:18:55,844 --> 00:18:57,262
SHE'S NICE.

444
00:18:58,472 --> 00:19:01,058
LIKE MOTHER,
LIKE DAUGHTER.

445
00:19:01,141 --> 00:19:03,101
TONIGHT WAS GOOD.

446
00:19:04,770 --> 00:19:07,105
YOU'RE MY LUCKY CHARM.

447
00:19:08,982 --> 00:19:10,901
TONIGHT WAS GOOD.

448
00:19:12,569 --> 00:19:13,070
PAIGE?

449
00:19:15,948 --> 00:19:16,990
ABOUT BEFORE...

450
00:19:19,284 --> 00:19:20,994
WHEN WE WERE DANCING?

451
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:22,871
WHAT ABOUT IT?

452
00:19:25,165 --> 00:19:27,167
WE WERE JUST HAVING FUN.

453
00:19:29,044 --> 00:19:30,671
NO BIG DEAL,
RIGHT?

454
00:19:32,130 --> 00:19:33,841
EMILY:
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
YOU SPENT IT ALL?!

455
00:19:33,924 --> 00:19:35,717
CHAD:
I MEAN I SPENT IT ALL!

456
00:19:35,801 --> 00:19:37,970
EMILY:
WHAT? HOW COULD YOU
BE SO STUPID, CHAD?!

457
00:19:38,053 --> 00:19:40,430
I'M WALKING YOU
HOME NOW. GO!

458
00:19:40,514 --> 00:19:41,890
CHAD:
DON'T EVER CALL ME STUPID!

459
00:19:41,974 --> 00:19:42,599
EMILY:
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

460
00:19:42,683 --> 00:19:43,517
CHAD:
THAT'S IT,
I'M OUT OF HERE!

461
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:44,601
CHAD, NO!
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?!

462
00:19:44,685 --> 00:19:45,644
ALEX:
WILL YOU STOP IT?!

463
00:20:06,290 --> 00:20:10,127
WILL YOU HOLD STILL?
I'M TRYING TO HELP.

464
00:20:12,004 --> 00:20:12,671
BEING HERE
IN YOUR ROOM,

465
00:20:12,754 --> 00:20:14,173
THIS HELPS.

466
00:20:15,841 --> 00:20:17,551
IT'S QUIET.

467
00:20:17,634 --> 00:20:20,637
NO SCREAMING,
NO SMASHING.

468
00:20:20,721 --> 00:20:23,765
NOBODY SHOULD HAVE TO DEAL
WITH DRAMA

469
00:20:23,849 --> 00:20:27,477
OF THE SHOVED-OVER-
THE-END TABLE VARIETY,

470
00:20:27,561 --> 00:20:29,396
DAY IN, DAY OUT.

471
00:20:30,022 --> 00:20:31,190
EVEN ME?

472
00:20:33,275 --> 00:20:35,027
ESPECIALLY YOU.

473
00:20:36,737 --> 00:20:39,156
PAIGE,
I'M IN TROUBLE.

474
00:20:39,239 --> 00:20:43,118
THIS ISN'T RELATED
TO ANY TABLE COLLISIONS

475
00:20:43,202 --> 00:20:45,537
THAT HAPPENED TONIGHT.

476
00:20:46,872 --> 00:20:50,167
IT'S A DIFFERENT
KIND OF TROUBLE.

477
00:21:04,681 --> 00:21:05,682
UM...

478
00:21:06,266 --> 00:21:08,227
OKAY, UH...

479
00:21:09,394 --> 00:21:11,772
SPEAKING OF TROUBLE UH...

480
00:21:12,606 --> 00:21:14,566
OR NOT TROUBLE UM...

481
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:18,487
UH YOU...
YOU SHOULD TAKE MY BED,

482
00:21:18,570 --> 00:21:21,532
AND I'M GONNA-
I'M GONNA SLEEP DOWNSTAIRS

483
00:21:21,615 --> 00:21:22,241
ON THE COUCH.

484
00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:23,450
PAIGE?

485
00:21:25,077 --> 00:21:26,662
NIGHTY-NIGHT THEN!
