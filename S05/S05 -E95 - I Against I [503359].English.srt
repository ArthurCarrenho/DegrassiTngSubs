00:07:55,225 --> 00:07:56,476
IT HELPS.

181
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:59,313
SO HOW ARE YOU?
FOR REAL?

182
00:07:59,396 --> 00:08:01,815
WHAT'S GOING ON
WITH YOU AND SNAKE?

183
00:08:01,899 --> 00:08:03,859
WELL, I'M NOT
GONNA WAIT AROUND

184
00:08:03,942 --> 00:08:07,070
WHILE HE CONTEMPLATES
HIS NAVEL,

185
00:08:07,154 --> 00:08:10,532
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT
THE MEANING OF LIFE.

186
00:08:10,616 --> 00:08:11,867
HERE'S TO MOVING ON.

187
00:08:12,951 --> 00:08:14,453
TO MOVING ON.

188
00:08:14,536 --> 00:08:17,664
AND TO THE BEST
NON-ANNIVERSARY PARTY EVER.

189
00:08:17,748 --> 00:08:19,917
MY BEST FRIEND,
MY GIRLS,

190
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,752
BROWNIES, WINE.

191
00:08:22,753 --> 00:08:24,838
WHAT MORE
COULD I ASK FOR?

192
00:08:24,922 --> 00:08:26,507
A BUFF GUY
IN A G-STRING

193
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:29,593
DROPPING IT
LIKE IT'S HOT, HUH?

194
00:08:30,761 --> 00:08:32,387
SIMPSON:
HELLO!

195
00:08:32,471 --> 00:08:34,097
ANYBODY HOME?

196
00:08:37,935 --> 00:08:39,019
CAITLIN, HEY!

197
00:08:40,854 --> 00:08:42,648
NICE OF L.A. TO SEND US UP
SOME SUNSHINE!

198
00:08:43,023 --> 00:08:44,358
HI ARCHIE.

199
00:08:45,025 --> 00:08:47,236
YOU CAN'T JUST
BARGE IN HERE ANYTIME.

200
00:08:47,319 --> 00:08:48,779
I'M SORRY.

201
00:08:48,862 --> 00:08:50,531
IT'S JUST UM...

202
00:08:50,614 --> 00:08:52,699
I ORDERED THIS FOR YOU
MONTHS AGO

203
00:08:52,783 --> 00:08:53,951
FOR OUR...

204
00:08:54,826 --> 00:08:55,577
YOU KNOW.

205
00:08:56,453 --> 00:08:57,788
I THOUGHT MAYBE
YOU SHOULD HAVE IT.

206
00:09:04,837 --> 00:09:07,506
I'LL JUST...
I'LL LEAVE THIS HERE.

207
00:09:28,569 --> 00:09:30,404
SPIKE:
SAPPHIRE.

208
00:09:31,113 --> 00:09:32,364
MY BIRTHSTONE.

209
00:09:34,449 --> 00:09:35,492
IT'S PERFECT.

210
00:09:37,327 --> 00:09:39,329
IT'S ABSOLUTELY PERFECT.

211
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:44,668
PERFECT.

212
00:09:46,086 --> 00:09:47,087
LINUS:
HEY, I WANT TO THANK YOU ALL

213
00:09:47,171 --> 00:09:48,589
FOR COMING IN
SO EARLY THIS MORNING,

214
00:09:48,672 --> 00:09:50,465
BUT UM...

215
00:09:50,549 --> 00:09:52,718
WE HAVE A SERIOUS ISSUE
AT HAND.

216
00:09:54,136 --> 00:09:55,387
I'M DISGUSTED...

217
00:09:56,013 --> 00:10:00,267
THAT THE SCHOOL WOULD LET
MARCO DEL ROSSI RUN THIS.

218
00:10:01,226 --> 00:10:03,604
DARCY:
BUT THE SCHOOL PROMOTES
SAFER SEX.

219
00:10:04,021 --> 00:10:04,605
PLEASE.

220
00:10:04,688 --> 00:10:06,106
EVERYONE KNOWS SAFER SEX

221
00:10:06,190 --> 00:10:08,192
IS JUST CODE
FOR PROMISCUOUS SEX.

222
00:10:08,775 --> 00:10:10,402
LINUS:
"JUST SAY YES TO SAFER SEX."

223
00:10:10,485 --> 00:10:11,528
WHAT IS THIS?

224
00:10:12,696 --> 00:10:15,032
THERE'S NO MENTION
OF ABSTINENCE AT ALL.

225
00:10:15,115 --> 00:10:16,491
SPINNER:
YEAH, BUT ISN'T THERE,

226
00:10:16,575 --> 00:10:18,702
LIKE, FREEDOM OF SPEECH
OR WHATEVER?

227
00:10:18,785 --> 00:10:20,162
YOU'RE RIGHT,
THERE IS.

228
00:10:20,245 --> 00:10:21,830
HE'S FREE TO TALK
ABOUT IMMORAL SEX

229
00:10:21,914 --> 00:10:23,540
AND WE'RE FREE
TO TRY TO STOP HIM.

230
00:10:25,209 --> 00:10:27,961
OKAY, LOOK, MARCO...
HE'S A FRIEND OF MINE.

231
00:10:28,545 --> 00:10:29,880
AND THAT'S WHY
WE'VE NOMINATED YOU

232
00:10:29,963 --> 00:10:31,381
TO TALK HIM INTO
CALLING THIS OFF.

233
00:10:31,548 --> 00:10:32,257
WHO'S WE?

234
00:10:33,884 --> 00:10:36,595
DARCY:
I DIDN'T VOTE FOR THIS.

235
00:10:36,678 --> 00:10:39,556
I THOUGHT THIS CLUB WAS ABOUT
TOLERANCE AND RESPECT.

236
00:10:40,641 --> 00:10:43,310
OH, WHAT ABOUT LOVE
YOUR NEIGHBOUR AS YOURSELF?

237
00:10:43,393 --> 00:10:44,520
LINUS:
WE BELIEVE THAT.

238
00:10:44,603 --> 00:10:46,688
BUT WE ALSO BELIEVE
IN ABSTINENCE,

239
00:10:46,772 --> 00:10:48,357
AND CONDOMS MAKE KIDS
HAVE SEX.

240
00:10:50,567 --> 00:10:51,652
DARCY...

241
00:10:51,735 --> 00:10:54,738
THIS SEMINAR GOES AGAINST
OUR VALUES.

242
00:10:55,989 --> 00:10:57,199
OKAY?
WE HAVE TO STOP IT,

243
00:10:57,282 --> 00:10:58,408
AND SPINNER'S OUR MAN.

244
00:10:59,326 --> 00:11:00,160
SPINNER:
DON'T BE SO SURE.

245
00:11:00,244 --> 00:11:02,037
MARCO WILL FREAK.

246
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:04,623
LOOK, ARE YOU WITH US
OR NOT?

247
00:11:14,383 --> 00:11:15,384
MORNING,

248
00:11:15,467 --> 00:11:18,303
FELLOW MEMBERS OF THE WORST
CHEER-UP SQUAD EVER.

249
00:11:18,387 --> 00:11:20,013
EMMA:
WHERE'S OUR VICTIM?

250
00:11:20,097 --> 00:11:21,932
SHE WENT
TO THE SALON EARLY.

251
00:11:22,015 --> 00:11:23,559
PROBABLY TO SWALLOW DYE.

252
00:11:24,059 --> 00:11:24,935
BUT I'M BRAINSTORMING

253
00:11:25,018 --> 00:11:26,353
ON HOW TO GIVE
THE CHEER-UP SQUAD

254
00:11:26,436 --> 00:11:27,604
A MAJOR COMEBACK.

255
00:11:28,063 --> 00:11:29,606
(WHISPERING)
MALE STRIPPER.

256
00:11:29,690 --> 00:11:31,525
CAITLIN:
SO FAR, I'VE GOT UH...

257
00:11:31,608 --> 00:11:32,818
GIRL MOVIE MARATHON,

258
00:11:32,901 --> 00:11:34,027
CRAFT NIGHT,

259
00:11:34,111 --> 00:11:36,321
FACE PAINTING
AND COTTON CANDY.

260
00:11:40,117 --> 00:11:41,827
YEAH, I KNOW,
I GOT NOTHIN'.

261
00:11:43,412 --> 00:11:44,788
I'VE GOT AN IDEA!

262
00:11:45,622 --> 00:11:47,541
HOW ABOUT WE GET
A MALE STRIPPER?

263
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,543
WOULD YOU SHUT UP
ALREADY?!

264
00:11:50,752 --> 00:11:53,088
THERE'S NO WAY SHE COULD KEEP
A STRAIGHT FACE THROUGH THAT.

265
00:11:53,172 --> 00:11:54,673
THAT'S A GREAT IDEA!

266
00:11:55,716 --> 00:11:56,633
GREAT IDEA?

267
00:11:56,717 --> 00:11:58,802
CAITLIN:
GET ME THE YELLOW PAGES
AND THE PHONE.

268
00:11:58,886 --> 00:12:00,721
WE ARE HAVING A PARTY!

269
00:12:00,804 --> 00:12:01,221
WOO!

270
00:12:04,433 --> 00:12:06,351
CAITLIN:
OH, YES!

271
00:12:08,312 --> 00:12:09,938
SPINNER:
UH, I-I NEED TO TALK TO YOU
ABOUT SOMETHING.

272
00:12:10,022 --> 00:12:10,814
DO YOU HAVE A SEC?

273
00:12:10,898 --> 00:12:11,732
NAH, SPIN.

274
00:12:11,815 --> 00:12:14,193
NOW'S NOT A GOOD TIME.

275
00:12:14,276 --> 00:12:16,612
OKAY, BUT JUST
THIS SEMINAR,

276
00:12:17,529 --> 00:12:20,782
YOU THINK MAYBE
IT'S A BIT MUCH?

277
00:12:20,866 --> 00:12:22,492
WHAT EXACTLY
IS A BIT MUCH?

278
00:12:22,576 --> 00:12:25,120
MAN, YOU GUYS ARE GIVING
OUT CONDOMS.

279
00:12:25,204 --> 00:12:27,122
YEAH. WE'RE PROMOTING
SAFER SEX.

280
00:12:29,208 --> 00:12:30,209
DON'T DO IT.

281
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:32,878
EXCUSE ME?

282
00:12:34,046 --> 00:12:36,548
JUST CANCEL THE SEMINAR,
OKAY?

283
00:12:37,132 --> 00:12:38,175
WHAT?!

284
00:12:38,258 --> 00:12:39,384
SPIN, GIVE ME...

285
00:12:39,468 --> 00:12:40,552
GIVE ME
ONE GOOD REASON WHY?

286
00:12:42,137 --> 00:12:44,765
CONDOMS MAKE KIDS
HAVE SEX, MAN.

287
00:12:44,848 --> 00:12:45,807
OH... WHOA...

288
00:12:45,891 --> 00:12:46,934
WOW, THAT'S RETARDED.

289
00:12:47,017 --> 00:12:48,143
WHERE DID YOU GET
THAT FROM, HUH?

290
00:12:48,227 --> 00:12:50,479
SOME STUPID PAMPHLET?

291
00:12:51,021 --> 00:12:52,481
HEY, I DIDN'T WANNA GET NASTY,

292
00:12:52,564 --> 00:12:55,651
BUT WHAT YOU'RE DOING
IS IMMORAL, MARCO.

293
00:12:55,734 --> 00:12:59,196
WHO THE HELL ARE YOU
TO SAY THAT, SPIN?

294
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:01,990
DUDE, IT'S IN THE BIBLE.

295
00:13:02,074 --> 00:13:03,784
THIS IS WRONG, OKAY?

296
00:13:03,867 --> 00:13:05,369
THIS IS SIN.

297
00:13:06,537 --> 00:13:09,164
WOW.
JIMMY WAS SO RIGHT.

298
00:13:11,667 --> 00:13:13,627
I SHOULD'VE NEVER
GIVEN YOU SECOND CHANCE.

299
00:13:20,008 --> 00:13:21,385
HATZILAKOS:
RIGHT.

300
00:13:21,468 --> 00:13:24,304
I APPROVED THE EVENT.
SO WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?

301
00:13:24,388 --> 00:13:25,889
THEY'RE GIVING OUT CONDOMS,
MS. H.

302
00:13:25,973 --> 00:13:28,851
IT'S GOING TO MAKE KIDS
RUN OUT AND HAVE SEX.

303
00:13:29,351 --> 00:13:32,938
GIVING OUT CONDOMS
DOES NOT MAKE KIDS HAVE SEX.

304
00:13:33,021 --> 00:13:35,274
YOU TWO ARE AWARE THAT
SOME TEENAGERS HAVE SEX.

305
00:13:35,357 --> 00:13:37,192
LINUS:
AND SOME DON'T.

306
00:13:37,818 --> 00:13:39,278
WE BELIEVE
IN ABSTINENCE.

307
00:13:39,361 --> 00:13:41,405
HATZILAKOS:
WELL, NOT EVERY TEENAGER DOES.

308
00:13:41,488 --> 00:13:43,615
WE HAD A GONORRHEA OUTBREAK
IN THE SCHOOL LAST YEAR

309
00:13:43,699 --> 00:13:45,826
SO IF GIVING OUT CONDOMS
HELPS AVOID IT,

310
00:13:45,909 --> 00:13:47,578
THEN I'M ALL FOR IT.

311
00:13:53,709 --> 00:13:54,918
MS. HATZILAKOS,

312
00:13:55,002 --> 00:13:57,337
PLEASE,
CANCEL THIS THING.

313
00:13:57,421 --> 00:13:58,964
IT'S-IT'S WRONG.

314
00:13:59,047 --> 00:14:00,799
I'M AFRAID
WE DON'T SEE EYE TO EYE

315
00:14:00,883 --> 00:14:03,302
AND I'M NOT CANCELLING IT.

316
00:14:03,385 --> 00:14:06,054
I THOUGHT YOU WERE
A GOOD CHRISTIAN.

317
00:14:06,138 --> 00:14:08,432
YOU'RE ON VERY THIN ICE
RIGHT NOW, GAVIN.

318
00:14:08,515 --> 00:14:09,641
DON'T MAKE ME REGRET

319
00:14:09,725 --> 00:14:11,059
LETTING YOU BACK
INTO THIS SCHOOL.

320
00:14:16,064 --> 00:14:16,690
HEY, EVERYBODY.

321
00:14:16,773 --> 00:14:19,151
JUST WANTED TO REMIND YOU THAT
THE SAFER SEX SEMINAR

322
00:14:19,234 --> 00:14:21,528
WILL BE HELD TODAY
AFTER SCHOOL IN THE GYM.

323
00:14:21,612 --> 00:14:23,280
SO IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS....

324
00:14:23,363 --> 00:14:24,698
SPINNER:
I TRIED TO STOP HIM.

325
00:14:24,781 --> 00:14:25,866
I REALLY DID.

326
00:14:26,783 --> 00:14:29,161
SO MUCH FOR HELPING YOU.

327
00:14:29,244 --> 00:14:32,706
SPINNER, THIS ISN'T
ABOUT HELPING ME.

328
00:14:32,789 --> 00:14:35,918
OKAY? IT'S ABOUT
RIGHT AND WRONG.

329
00:14:37,085 --> 00:14:40,589
WHAT DO YOU THINK
MS. HATZILAKOS WOULD DO

330
00:14:40,672 --> 00:14:41,715
IF WE WENT ON THERE

331
00:14:41,798 --> 00:14:43,550
AND TOLD EVERYONE
WHAT WE BELIEVED?

332
00:14:43,634 --> 00:14:45,719
MS. ANTI-CHRISTIAN.

333
00:14:46,595 --> 00:14:47,888
IT'S LIKE WE'RE
THE BAD GUYS.

334
00:14:47,971 --> 00:14:50,516
'CAUSE THE SYSTEM
IS AGAINST US.

335
00:14:50,599 --> 00:14:51,725
WELL, I'M SICK OF IT.

336
00:14:51,808 --> 00:14:52,726
THAT'S THE SPIRIT,
BRO.

337
00:14:52,809 --> 00:14:54,061
WE GOTTA TAKE
THIS SCHOOL BACK,

338
00:14:54,144 --> 00:14:55,938
MAKE IT SAFE
FOR THE NORMAL PEOPLE.

339
00:15:03,946 --> 00:15:05,948
"NO SEX IS SAFE SEX?"

340
00:15:06,031 --> 00:15:08,575
YEAH. WE'RE FIGHTING BACK,
ME AND LINUS.

341
00:15:08,659 --> 00:15:10,869
IT'S A BIT EXTREME,
DON'T YOU THINK?

342
00:15:10,953 --> 00:15:12,704
SO YOU WANT MARCO
GIVING OUT CONDOMS?

343
00:15:12,788 --> 00:15:14,081
NO,
NOT REALLY,

344
00:15:14,164 --> 00:15:15,999
BUT HE HAS THE RIGHT TO.

345
00:15:16,667 --> 00:15:18,961
YEAH, THAT'S WHAT
MS. HATZILAKOS SAID.

346
00:15:19,378 --> 00:15:20,087
SO...

347
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:22,005
SO I DON'T ANSWER TO HER,
'KAY?

348
00:15:22,673 --> 00:15:24,716
I ANSWER TO SOMEONE
A LOT HIGHER.

349
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,218
WHO? LINUS?

350
00:15:27,261 --> 00:15:28,762
HAVE YOU EVER LISTENED
TO LINUS?

351
00:15:28,846 --> 00:15:30,264
I MEAN REALLY LISTENED
TO HIM?

352
00:15:30,347 --> 00:15:31,682
HE'S GOT A LOT OF VIEWS
THAT ARE-

353
00:15:31,765 --> 00:15:33,809
YOU KNOW, MAYBE YOU SHOULD
JUST STAY OUT OF THIS,

354
00:15:33,892 --> 00:15:34,560
OKAY?

355
00:15:35,477 --> 00:15:36,436
FINE.

356
00:15:42,526 --> 00:15:43,527
WHOA!

357
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:44,903
SEMINAR'S STARTING.

358
00:15:44,987 --> 00:15:46,321
YOU READY?

359
00:15:47,322 --> 00:15:49,366
SPINNER:
YEAH, I'M READY.

360
00:15:54,454 --> 00:15:55,414
BOY:
CHOOSE ABSTINENCE!

361
00:15:55,497 --> 00:15:56,373
GIRL:
ABSTINENCE IS THE ANSWER!

362
00:15:56,456 --> 00:15:58,250
SPINNER:
ABSTINENCE EQUALS SAFE SEX!

363
00:15:58,333 --> 00:15:59,334
NO! SHHHH!

364
00:15:59,418 --> 00:15:59,877
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

365
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:00,794
ARE YOU OUT OF YOU MIND?

366
00:16:00,878 --> 00:16:02,546
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE,
WITH SIGNS?

367
00:16:02,629 --> 00:16:04,131
WE HAVE THE RIGHT
TO PROTEST.

368
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:08,468
LIKE YOU HAVE THE FAINTEST IDEA
WHAT YOU'RE PROTESTING.

369
00:16:08,552 --> 00:16:10,262
WE'RE JUST TRYING
TO EDUCATE PEOPLE.

370
00:16:10,345 --> 00:16:11,972
YOU'RE PROMOTING
PROMISCUITY.

371
00:16:12,055 --> 00:16:13,599
YOU'RE PROMOTING
STUPIDITY.

372
00:16:13,682 --> 00:16:15,934
ELLIE:
YOU THINK IT'S BETTER THAT
PEOPLE HAVE UNWANTED BABIES?

373
00:16:16,018 --> 00:16:17,769
I THINK IT'S BETTER
PEOPLE DON'T HAVE SEX

374
00:16:17,853 --> 00:16:18,979
UNLESS THEY'RE MARRIED.

375
00:16:19,062 --> 00:16:19,354
STOP!

376
00:16:19,438 --> 00:16:21,273
LOOK,
JUST LEAVE US ALONE.

377
00:16:21,356 --> 00:16:23,734
GO HOME, GO TO CHURCH,
DO WHATEVER.

378
00:16:23,817 --> 00:16:24,860
LINUS:
WHY DON'T YOU TRY
GOING TO CHURCH?

379
00:16:24,943 --> 00:16:26,612
I DO,
EVERY SUNDAY.

380
00:16:28,822 --> 00:16:30,115
AND THEY LET YOU IN?

381
00:16:30,199 --> 00:16:31,366
WHAT'S THAT SUPPOSED
TO MEAN?

382
00:16:31,450 --> 00:16:33,410
LINUS:
I THINK YOU KNOW
EXACTLY WHAT IT MEANS.

383
00:16:33,493 --> 00:16:35,704
THE BIBLE IS CLEAR
ABOUT SEXUAL DEVIANCY.

384
00:16:35,787 --> 00:16:38,457
WHAT?!
WHO IS THIS BIGOTED FREAK?

385
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:40,125
LINUS:
SO I'M A FREAK.

386
00:16:40,209 --> 00:16:42,169
IT'S BETTER
THAN BEING A HOMO.

387
00:16:42,252 --> 00:16:43,128
SPINNER:
WHOA, WHOA...

388
00:16:43,212 --> 00:16:43,962
GUYS, TAKE IT EASY.

389
00:16:44,046 --> 00:16:45,631
NO SPINNER,
SHUT UP!

390
00:16:45,714 --> 00:16:46,340
YOU AND YOUR FRIEND,

391
00:16:46,423 --> 00:16:48,634
JUST GO TO HELL.

392
00:16:48,717 --> 00:16:49,968
SO WE CAN VISIT YOU,
FAG?

393
00:16:57,768 --> 00:16:59,728
TIM:
COME ON, STOP! STOP!

394
00:17:05,901 --> 00:17:06,985
DON'T LET THEM CORRUPT YOU,
SPINNER.

395
00:17:07,069 --> 00:17:08,403
IT'S WHAT THEY DO.

396
00:17:08,487 --> 00:17:09,988
LINUS, IF I WERE YOU,

397
00:17:10,072 --> 00:17:11,990
I WOULD START WALKING,
NOW.

398
00:17:28,882 --> 00:17:30,926
LIZ:
FINALLY, WE GET TO FIND OUT
WHAT'S FOR DINNER?

399
00:17:31,009 --> 00:17:32,010
WHAT'S THE SURPRISE?

400
00:17:32,094 --> 00:17:33,220
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

401
00:17:33,303 --> 00:17:35,556
SPIKE:
WITH CAITLIN IN CHARGE,
WHO KNOWS?

402
00:17:35,639 --> 00:17:37,349
IT'LL BE ELEGANT
AT ANY RATE.

403
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:40,269
CAITLIN:
DINNER IS SERVED!

404
00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:42,104
(CHEERING)

405
00:17:44,106 --> 00:17:46,275
SPIKE:
THIS IS OUTRAGEOUS!

406
00:17:46,775 --> 00:17:48,193
MANNY:
TRY THE DYNAMITE ROLLS.

407
00:17:48,277 --> 00:17:50,779
EMMA:
I HEAR THEY'RE DYNAMITE!

408
00:17:54,575 --> 00:17:55,701
CAITLIN:
I HOPE EVERYONE'S HUNGRY

409
00:17:55,784 --> 00:17:58,704
BECAUSE DESSERT
IS THEIR SPECIALTY!

410
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:06,879
WOMAN:
TAKE IT OFF!

411
00:18:06,962 --> 00:18:07,796
(CHEERING)

412
00:18:12,968 --> 00:18:13,468
SORRY,

413
00:18:15,012 --> 00:18:15,929
DO YOU NOT LIKE CHOCOLATE?

414
00:18:16,722 --> 00:18:19,057
SPIKE:
NO, I LOVE CHOCOLATE.

415
00:18:21,351 --> 00:18:22,811
YOU JUST LOOK LIKE SOMEBODY.

416
00:18:26,315 --> 00:18:27,274
MY HUSBAND.

417
00:18:39,870 --> 00:18:41,788
THERE,
IT'S ON THE HOUSE,

418
00:18:41,872 --> 00:18:44,208
FOR STILL HAVING ANYTHING
TO DO WITH ME.

419
00:18:44,291 --> 00:18:46,585
I'M GETTING USED
TO FORGIVING YOU.

420
00:18:46,668 --> 00:18:48,545
IF ONLY MY BEST FRIEND
COULD SEE IT LIKE THAT.

421
00:18:53,133 --> 00:18:54,927
YOU SHOULD GO OVER THERE.

422
00:18:55,010 --> 00:18:57,804
IT'S LIKE WALKING
INTO THE LION'S DEN.

423
00:18:57,888 --> 00:18:58,680
DARCY:
COME ON, SPIN.

424
00:18:58,764 --> 00:19:00,933
WHAT HAVE YOU GOT TO LOSE?

425
00:19:10,442 --> 00:19:11,860
SPINNER:
UH, MARCO...

426
00:19:11,944 --> 00:19:13,487
I JUST WANTED YOU TO KNOW,

427
00:19:13,570 --> 00:19:16,615
I AM NEVER TALKING
TO LINUS AGAIN, OKAY?

428
00:19:16,698 --> 00:19:18,242
EITHER HE'S OUT
OF THE FRIENDSHIP CLUB

429
00:19:18,325 --> 00:19:19,076
OR I AM.

430
00:19:19,159 --> 00:19:20,953
MARCO:
SPIN, YOU DO WHATEVER
YOU WANT,

431
00:19:21,036 --> 00:19:21,828
CAUSE REALLY,

432
00:19:21,912 --> 00:19:24,331
I COULDN'T CARE LESS ABOUT YOU
AND YOUR STUPID CLUB.

433
00:19:24,414 --> 00:19:26,792
I'M NOT LIKE HIM,
OKAY?

434
00:19:26,875 --> 00:19:28,293
SPINNER,
THIS IS NOT THE TIME.

435
00:19:28,377 --> 00:19:30,879
SPINNER:
NO, IT'S NEVER GOING
TO BE THE TIME!

436
00:19:30,963 --> 00:19:31,880
YOU GOT THAT RIGHT.

437
00:19:32,130 --> 00:19:32,965
JIMMY, SHUT UP!

438
00:19:33,048 --> 00:19:35,592
MARCO,
I AM NOT HOMOPHOBIC.

439
00:19:35,676 --> 00:19:37,094
YOU KNOW THAT, OKAY?

440
00:19:37,177 --> 00:19:41,223
ALL I EVER WANTED TO DO
WAS BE YOUR FRIEND AGAIN.

441
00:19:42,891 --> 00:19:45,143
I SCREWED IT UP,
OKAY?

442
00:19:45,227 --> 00:19:47,646
AND I AM REALLY,
REALLY SORRY.

443
00:20:10,711 --> 00:20:12,546
I FEEL TERRIBLE.

444
00:20:13,797 --> 00:20:16,967
IN THIS CASE,
TERRIBLE IS GOOD.

445
00:20:17,968 --> 00:20:19,386
I MEAN, YOU SAID YOU
AND SNAKE ARE OVER.

446
00:20:19,469 --> 00:20:21,013
YOU NEED TO START
DEALING WITH THAT.

447
00:20:21,096 --> 00:20:22,389
I CAN'T.

448
00:20:22,472 --> 00:20:23,807
YOU DON'T HAVE A CHOICE,
HON.

449
00:20:23,891 --> 00:20:25,726
YOU SAID THE RELATIONSHIP
IS OVER.

450
00:20:26,310 --> 00:20:27,269
NOT FOR ME.

451
00:20:34,193 --> 00:20:34,943
CAITLIN...

452
00:20:38,614 --> 00:20:40,324
I'M STILL IN LOVE
WITH HIM.

453
00:20:46,413 --> 00:20:47,080
(CRYING)

454
00:21:01,678 --> 00:21:02,846
SPINNER...

455
00:21:09,144 --> 00:21:11,813
YOU REALLY ARE LOST,
AREN'T YOU?

456
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:17,402
YOU HAVE NO IDEA.
