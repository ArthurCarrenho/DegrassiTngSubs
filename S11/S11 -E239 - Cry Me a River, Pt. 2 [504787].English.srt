1
00:00:01,668 --> 00:00:03,295
DAVE:
IT JUST FELT SO RIGHT,
GETTING THE WORDS OUT THERE.

2
00:00:03,378 --> 00:00:04,296
BAM!

3
00:00:04,379 --> 00:00:06,048
EVERYONE'S TALKING ABOUT IT.

4
00:00:06,131 --> 00:00:07,341
WELL, THAT'S THE POINT,
RIGHT?

5
00:00:07,424 --> 00:00:08,425
NO POINT IN HAVING
A RADIO SHOW

6
00:00:08,509 --> 00:00:11,345
IF YOU CAN'T GET PEOPLE
TO LISTEN.

7
00:00:11,428 --> 00:00:13,096
IT'S NOT EVERY DAY
THAT SOMEONE CALLS OUT

8
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:15,140
THEIR TRANSGENDER CO-HOST
ON-AIR.

9
00:00:15,224 --> 00:00:17,518
(SIGHS) CAN YOU BELIEVE
ADAM BAILED?

10
00:00:17,601 --> 00:00:18,519
LIKE I THOUGHT
HE COULD TAKE IT.

11
00:00:18,602 --> 00:00:20,187
SURE, BUT...

12
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:22,356
DON'T YOU THINK YOU TOOK IT
LIKE A LITTLE TOO FAR?

13
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:23,357
HOW WOULD YOU FEEL

14
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:25,484
IF SOME DUDE WAS STARING AT YOU
WHILE YOU WHIZ?

15
00:00:25,567 --> 00:00:26,610
OKAY, GROSS.

16
00:00:26,693 --> 00:00:28,153
EXACTLY!

17
00:00:28,237 --> 00:00:30,280
LOOK, I SAID HOW I FEEL.
FREEDOM OF SPEECH.

18
00:00:30,364 --> 00:00:31,865
DAVE.

19
00:00:34,076 --> 00:00:35,452
YOU ATTACKED ME
ON AIR

20
00:00:35,536 --> 00:00:36,954
INSTEAD OF JUST
TALKING TO ME?

21
00:00:37,037 --> 00:00:38,539
I EXPRESSED AN OPINION.

22
00:00:38,622 --> 00:00:40,832
IF YOU CAN'T TAKE IT-
EXCUSE ME?

23
00:00:40,916 --> 00:00:43,043
I'M JUST SAYING,
IF IT'S TOO INTENSE FOR YOU,

24
00:00:43,126 --> 00:00:44,795
I'LL DO THE SHOW SOLO.

25
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:46,964
MAYBE WE SHOULDN'T HOST
THE SHOW TOGETHER.

26
00:00:47,047 --> 00:00:50,801
THE LGBT CLUB HAS A PETITION
TO GET YOU KICKED OFF.

27
00:00:50,884 --> 00:00:55,430
"REMOVE DAVE TURNER
FROM DEGRASSI'S AIRWAVES"?

28
00:00:55,514 --> 00:00:56,515
DID YOU DO THIS?

29
00:00:56,598 --> 00:00:59,017
NOPE, WASN'T MY IDEA.

30
00:00:59,101 --> 00:01:00,978
BUT PRETTY SOON,
I'LL BE HOSTING THE SHOW SOLO.

50
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,206
OH.
WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU?

51
00:02:02,289 --> 00:02:04,750
YOU GUYS ARE PROTESTING ME?

52
00:02:04,833 --> 00:02:07,044
YEAH, YOU USED THE WORD
"TRANNY" ON THE RADIO.

53
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:09,004
THAT'S HATEFUL LANGUAGE.

54
00:02:09,087 --> 00:02:10,005
BUT...

55
00:02:10,088 --> 00:02:11,465
NO, NO, I JUST ASKED
WHAT PEOPLE THOUGHT

56
00:02:11,548 --> 00:02:13,425
ABOUT TRANSGENDERED GUYS
BEING IN THE BATHROOM.

57
00:02:13,509 --> 00:02:14,801
YOU MADE IT CLEAR
YOU'RE AGAINST IT

58
00:02:14,885 --> 00:02:16,470
FROM A POWER POSITION.

59
00:02:16,553 --> 00:02:18,222
I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING WRONG!

60
00:02:18,305 --> 00:02:21,308
REALLY?
YOU REALLY THINK THAT?

61
00:02:26,522 --> 00:02:27,773
ALLI:
YOU OKAY?

62
00:02:27,856 --> 00:02:29,733
NO! KATIE WON'T GIVE ME
A CHANCE TO APOLOGIZE!

63
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:31,318
I'VE CALLED HER,
EMAILED HER!

64
00:02:31,401 --> 00:02:32,736
WHAT ABOUT
A FRIENDLY TEXT?

65
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:33,987
I'M SORRY,
SMILEY FACE?

66
00:02:34,071 --> 00:02:36,031
YEAH, THAT'LL PROVE
I'M NEWSPAPER MATERIAL!

67
00:02:36,114 --> 00:02:38,242
WELL, MAYBE YOU CAN JOIN
A DIFFERENT CLUB.

68
00:02:38,325 --> 00:02:39,243
THERE'S GOTTA BE
SOMETHING ELSE

69
00:02:39,326 --> 00:02:40,577
WHERE YOU WON'T RUN
INTO ELI.

70
00:02:40,661 --> 00:02:42,746
I-I REALLY WANTED
TO BE ON NEWSPAPER, ALLI,

71
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:44,456
AND I KNOW I'D BE GOOD
IF I COULD JUST...

72
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:46,250
ALLI:
CURB YOUR ENTHUSIASM?

73
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:47,334
(LAUGHS)

74
00:02:48,836 --> 00:02:50,504
I NEED TO GET KATIE
TO TALK TO ME.

75
00:02:50,587 --> 00:02:53,048
YOU'RE A SMART COOKIE,
YOU WILL.

76
00:02:53,131 --> 00:02:54,383
(BOTH LAUGH)

77
00:02:54,466 --> 00:02:55,884
HEY, SAV!

78
00:02:55,968 --> 00:02:58,220
HAVE YOU HEARD ABOUT
THIS WHOLE PETITION THING?

79
00:02:58,303 --> 00:02:59,429
OH, I'VE DEFINITELY HEARD.

80
00:02:59,513 --> 00:03:00,848
IT'S RIDICULOUS, RIGHT?
LOOK, ALL I SAID

81
00:03:00,931 --> 00:03:02,516
WAS IT'S STRANGE TO HAVE GIRLS
IN THE GUYS' BATHROOM,

82
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:04,935
AND PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT ME
LIKE I'M SOME SORT OF CRIMINAL!

83
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:07,938
WHICH IS WHY I CAN'T LET YOU
BACK ON THE AIR.

84
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:10,649
WHAT?! I THOUGHT YOU SAID
I WAS GREAT!

85
00:03:10,732 --> 00:03:12,442
REMEMBER?
FUNNY, CONTROVERSIAL?

86
00:03:12,526 --> 00:03:13,694
YEAH,
BUT THERE'S A FINE LINE

87
00:03:13,777 --> 00:03:16,238
BETWEEN CONTROVERSIAL
AND OFFENSIVE.

88
00:03:16,321 --> 00:03:17,656
A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE PISSED,
MAN.

89
00:03:17,739 --> 00:03:19,032
ESPECIALLY YOUR CO-HOST.

90
00:03:19,116 --> 00:03:22,578
YOU-YOU CAN'T SILENCE ME
'CAUSE I HAVE AN OPINION!

91
00:03:22,661 --> 00:03:24,371
ALL RIGHT,
I'M GOING TO SIMPSON.

92
00:03:24,454 --> 00:03:25,831
(SCOFFS)

93
00:03:25,914 --> 00:03:27,499
YEAH, GO TO SIMPSON.

94
00:03:27,583 --> 00:03:29,084
BUT I WAS THE ONE
WHO CALMED HIM DOWN.

95
00:03:29,168 --> 00:03:31,295
SIMPSON WANTED YOU
SUSPENDED!

96
00:03:31,378 --> 00:03:33,505
SI-

97
00:03:33,589 --> 00:03:34,798
SO YOU'RE CANCELLING
THE SHOW?

98
00:03:34,882 --> 00:03:36,508
SAV:
NO.

99
00:03:36,592 --> 00:03:38,385
WE'RE NOT CANCELLING THE SHOW,

100
00:03:38,468 --> 00:03:41,638
YOU'RE JUST NOT HOSTING
ANYMORE.

101
00:03:43,182 --> 00:03:44,892
AND ADAM IS?!

102
00:03:45,893 --> 00:03:48,437
SO THAT'S HOW IT IS?!

103
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:50,230
ALL RIGHT.

104
00:03:50,314 --> 00:03:51,690

APPLY MYSELF AT SCHOOL,

108
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:01,909
OR IT'S BACK TO NEW YORK
I GO.

109
00:04:01,992 --> 00:04:03,410
WHERE'D YOU TAKE OFF TO,
ANYWAY?

110
00:04:03,493 --> 00:04:05,579
I JUST HUNG OUT
WITH CHARLIE.

111
00:04:05,662 --> 00:04:06,914
AHA!

112
00:04:06,997 --> 00:04:09,333

114
00:04:11,001 --> 00:04:12,252
AT LEAST, WE WERE.

115
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:14,254
SHE STILL HASN'T CALLED ME BACK

116
00:04:14,338 --> 00:04:17,049
SINCE MY MOM LOST IT
IN FRONT OF HER.

117
00:04:17,132 --> 00:04:18,300
WHAT IF SHE DOESN'T?

118
00:04:18,383 --> 00:04:20,219
WELL THEN, SHE'S NOT
A FRIEND WORTH HAVING.

119
00:04:20,302 --> 00:04:21,428
BESIDES, YOU'RE WORRYING
TOO MUCH ABOUT HER.

120
00:04:21,512 --> 00:04:23,305
YOU SHOULD BE KEEPING
YOUR PROMISE TO YOUR MOM.

121
00:04:23,388 --> 00:04:24,306
I WILL,

122
00:04:24,389 --> 00:04:26,350
ONCE I KNOW THAT EVERYTHING'S
OKAY WITH CHARLIE.

123
00:04:26,433 --> 00:04:28,519
IF SHE'S NOT CALLING
YOU BACK...

124
00:04:28,602 --> 00:04:31,021
THEN I SHOULD GO TALK
TO HER IN PERSON!

125
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:33,565

WITH THAT AT ALL!

OF "ITCH".

351
00:13:14,628 --> 00:13:16,338
OH, COME ON,
KATIE'S ON HONOUR ROLL,

352
00:13:16,421 --> 00:13:18,173
SHE'S A REGIONAL
SOCCER CHAMP.

353
00:13:18,257 --> 00:13:19,174
SHE RAISED THE MOST MONEY

354
00:13:19,258 --> 00:13:20,467
FOR OUR "FREE THE CHILDREN"
CAMPAIGN LAST YEAR,

355
00:13:20,551 --> 00:13:22,427
ALL BY HERSELF.

356
00:13:22,511 --> 00:13:23,428
YOU DON'T GET
WHERE KATIE'S AT

357
00:13:23,512 --> 00:13:25,430
BY LETTING YOUNGER STUDENTS
PUSH YOU AROUND.

358
00:13:25,514 --> 00:13:27,057
WELL,
YOU'RE AN OLDER STUDENT,

359

373
00:13:56,503 --> 00:13:57,546

00:14:32,539 --> 00:14:33,957
IT SHOULD BE REAL.

TO PEOPLE OUR AGE.

393
00:14:38,212 --> 00:14:41,173

YOU WON'T FIT IN,

394
00:14:42,925 --> 00:14:44,593
FEELING ALONE,

395
00:14:46,178 --> 00:14:48,972
OR BEING COMPLETELY AWKWARD.

396
00:14:49,056 --> 00:14:50,641

526
00:19:49,523 --> 00:19:51,191
YEAH, WELL,
THERE'S NO NEED FOR PINING.

527
00:19:51,275 --> 00:19:54,069
AND IT WON'T EXACTLY BE
FROM AFAR.

528
00:19:54,152 --> 00:19:55,654
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

529
00:19:55,737 --> 00:19:57,030
CHARLIE'S LOSING
HER APARTMENT,

530
00:19:57,114 --> 00:20:00,742
SO I SAID SHE COULD
MOVE IN WITH ME.

531
00:20:00,826 --> 00:20:03,245
FRIENDS DON'T LET FRIENDS
BE HOMELESS, HOLLY J!

532
00:20:03,328 --> 00:20:05,706
YOU HAVE A HUGE CRUSH
ON HER, FIONA!

533
00:20:05,789 --> 00:20:08,041
HOW CAN YOU POSSIBLY LIVE
TOGETHER PLATONICALLY?

534
00:20:08,125 --> 00:20:10,961
AND WHAT WILL
MAMA COYNE THINK?

535
00:20:11,044 --> 00:20:13,589
SHE ALWAYS TAUGHT ME
TO BE CHARITABLE.

536
00:20:13,672 --> 00:20:14,673
(LAUGHS)

537
00:20:16,383 --> 00:20:17,301
FOR THOSE OF YOU
WHO DON'T KNOW,

538
00:20:17,384 --> 00:20:18,719
THE OTHER DAY I TALKED ABOUT
HOW I WAS SURPRISED

539
00:20:18,802 --> 00:20:22,347
THAT TRANSGENDERED KIDS GOT
TO USE THE REGULAR BATHROOM.

540
00:20:22,431 --> 00:20:25,350
I RAN INTO THAT SITUATION,
AND I WAS FREAKED, OKAY?

541
00:20:25,434 --> 00:20:27,227
I CAN ADMIT THAT.

542
00:20:27,311 --> 00:20:28,937
I-I USED STUPID,
HATEFUL LANGUAGE,

543
00:20:29,021 --> 00:20:31,607
AND I OFFENDED
A LOT OF PEOPLE -

544
00:20:31,690 --> 00:20:33,942
MY CO-HOST,
IN PARTICULAR -

545
00:20:34,026 --> 00:20:35,986
AND I'M REALLY SORRY.

546
00:20:36,069 --> 00:20:37,070
I SHOULD'VE TOLD HIM
HOW I FELT,

547
00:20:37,154 --> 00:20:38,572
AND, YOU KNOW,

548
00:20:38,655 --> 00:20:40,282
STARTED A DIALOGUE.

549
00:20:41,325 --> 00:20:43,202
ADAM:
SIR? JUST LET HIM FINISH.

550
00:20:43,285 --> 00:20:45,621
DAVE:
AND IF YOU GUYS LET ME
KEEP DOING THE SHOW,

551
00:20:45,704 --> 00:20:47,331
THAT'S WHAT I'LL DO.

552
00:20:47,414 --> 00:20:49,249
TALK ABOUT THE TOUGH STUFF.

553
00:20:49,333 --> 00:20:50,501
ASK QUESTIONS,

554
00:20:50,584 --> 00:20:54,004
TRY AND UNDERSTAND,
INSTEAD OF JUDGE.

555
00:20:54,087 --> 00:20:56,507
SO, ADAM TORRES,
YOU'RE DOWN FOR THIS?

556
00:20:58,008 --> 00:20:59,843
UH... DEPENDS.

557
00:21:01,762 --> 00:21:03,680
ARE YOU GONNA BE PULLING
ANY OTHER SKELETONS

558
00:21:03,764 --> 00:21:04,973
OUT OF MY CLOSET?

559
00:21:05,057 --> 00:21:07,935
DAVE:
NOPE, JUST WANT HONEST TALK.

560
00:21:08,018 --> 00:21:10,521
SO THE QUESTION HERE IS...

561
00:21:10,604 --> 00:21:12,564
WHAT MAKES YOU A GUY, EXACTLY?

562
00:21:12,648 --> 00:21:14,274
TELL US.

563
00:21:14,358 --> 00:21:16,193
NO, THE QUESTION IS...

564
00:21:17,402 --> 00:21:18,946
WHAT MAKES YOU A GUY?

565
00:21:19,029 --> 00:21:20,197
(LAUGHS)

566
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:22,282
OKAY, I DESERVED THAT.

567
00:21:22,366 --> 00:21:24,743
LOOK, YOU KNOW
YOU'RE A GUY,

568
00:21:24,826 --> 00:21:26,453
SO DO I.

569
00:21:26,537 --> 00:21:28,580
BUT I GOT WRONG EQUIPMENT.

570
00:21:28,664 --> 00:21:29,873
DAVE:
WHAT, YOU CAN'T EXCHANGE?

571
00:21:29,957 --> 00:21:31,375
(LAUGHS)

572
00:21:31,458 --> 00:21:33,252
MAYBE SOME DAY.

573
00:21:33,335 --> 00:21:36,463
ENOUGH TALK,
THE PEOPLE WANT TUNES!

574
00:21:36,547 --> 00:21:38,298
DAVE:
ALL RIGHT.

575
00:21:38,382 --> 00:21:39,550
WE'LL BE BACK.

576
00:21:39,633 --> 00:21:40,801

577
00:21:40,884 --> 00:21:42,469
