TALKING ABOUT YOU,

8
00:00:23,607 --> 00:00:25,442
SAYING YOU MIGHT BE
BULIMIC.

9
00:00:25,526 --> 00:00:27,778

AN EATING DISORDER!

22
00:00:50,342 --> 00:00:52,678

GIVE US A SECOND.

23
00:00:53,679 --> 00:00:55,722
I DON'T NEED
TO DO ANYTHING.

24
00:00:55,806 --> 00:00:56,890
YOU CALLED ME
A HOME-WRECKER.

25
00:00:56,974 --> 00:00:59,351
AT LEAST THAT WAS TRUE.

26
00:00:59,434 --> 00:01:00,811

IS UNDER CONTROL.

27
00:01:00,894 --> 00:01:02,479
I'VE KEPT EVERYTHING DOWN
FOR MONTHS.

28
00:01:02,563 --> 00:01:04,690
YOU STILL WATCH
EVERY CALORIE YOU EAT.

29
00:01:04,773 --> 00:01:06,984
SO DO HALF THE GIRLS

WHAT'S THAT SUPPOSED
TO MEAN?

34
00:01:14,867 --> 00:01:16,326
YOU THINK DREW'S
THE TYPE OF GUY

35
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:18,704
WHO STICKS AROUND
WHEN THINGS GET MESSY?

36
00:01:18,787 --> 00:01:21,790
BECAUSE YOU, KATIE,
CAN GET VERY MESSY.

37
00:01:21,874 --> 00:01:22,791

HAND ME ANOTHER BRANCH.

60
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:29,274
WHERE'D YOU LEARN
HOW TO DO THIS?

61
00:02:29,358 --> 00:02:31,401
MY DAD'S BEST FRIEND
WAS THIS MOHAWK GUY.

62
00:02:31,485 --> 00:02:32,402
HE BUILT ONE OF THESE

63
00:02:32,486 --> 00:02:34,029

MOSTLY, I JUST CHOPPED TREES.

68
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:44,039
THAT'S TOO BAD.
TALKING CAN BE THERAPEUTIC.

69
00:02:44,122 --> 00:02:45,415
FOR EXAMPLE,
IF YOU HAD A PROBLEM,

70
00:02:45,499 --> 00:02:46,416
SHARED IT WITH ME,

71
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:47,709
I BET YOU'D FEEL
A WHOLE LOT BETTER.

72
00:02:47,793 --> 00:02:49,378
GOOD TO KNOW.

73
00:02:54,132 --> 00:02:56,051
I KNOW YOU AND CLARE
AREN'T GETTING ALONG

74
00:02:56,134 --> 00:02:57,052
AND I THINK I CAN HELP -

75
00:02:57,135 --> 00:02:59,054
GIVE YOU SOME ADVICE,
MAN TO MAN.

76
00:02:59,137 --> 00:03:00,597
LOOK, I DATED CLARE
FOR THREE MONTHS.

77
00:03:00,681 --> 00:03:02,015
I KNOW HER.

78
00:03:03,267 --> 00:03:04,726
JUST TELL ME
WHAT'S WRONG.

79
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:06,687
THEN YOU'LL LEAVE ME
ALONE?

80
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:08,021
YEAH, SURE.

81
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:12,734
(SIGHS) CLARE WANTS
TO GO TO THIS MOVIE

82
00:03:12,818 --> 00:03:14,319
AND I SAID
IT WASN'T MY THING.

83
00:03:14,403 --> 00:03:16,238
SO YOU'RE GONNA GO
WITH HER, RIGHT?

84
00:03:16,321 --> 00:03:17,698
SHE SAID SHE DIDN'T
WANT ME TO.

85
00:03:17,781 --> 00:03:18,740

WHAT SHE SAID-

86
00:03:18,824 --> 00:03:19,741
NO OFFENSE, DUDE,

87
00:03:19,825 --> 00:03:22,536
BUT I'M NOT GONNA TAKE ADVICE
ABOUT CLARE FROM YOU,

88
00:03:22,619 --> 00:03:24,746

WELL, YOU SHOULDN'T

111
00:04:04,036 --> 00:04:05,829
BECAUSE WE HEARD SHE'S SPREADING
A RUMOR ABOUT YOU.

112
00:04:05,913 --> 00:04:07,206

NO, NO. THIS IS
THE PERFECT PLAN.

THE ELECTION.

MAYBE IF I ACE THE Q & A
THIS AFTERNOON,

189
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:03,590
THE RUMORS WILL STOP
FLYING.

190

JUST RUMORS, RIGHT?

191
00:07:06,927 --> 00:07:08,846
YOU BELIEVE A STUPID APP
OVER ME?

192
00:07:08,929 --> 00:07:10,472
NO, I'M JUST SAYING...

194
00:07:11,849 --> 00:07:13,308
IT'S NOT.

OKAY, GUYS, I DIDN'T PLAN THIS
SO YOU GUYS COULD FIGHT.

350
00:14:04,845 --> 00:14:06,930
THEN LET US OUT.
YEAH, THIS CRAZY,
EVEN FOR YOU.

351
00:14:07,014 --> 00:14:09,266
OKAY, I'M NOT CRAZY,
I'M BIPOLAR.

352
00:14:12,352 --> 00:14:14,605

UNTIL A FEW WEEKS AGO,

353
00:14:14,688 --> 00:14:16,315
I THOUGHT I COULD WIN
CLARE BACK.

TO BE HAPPY.

357
00:14:22,863 --> 00:14:26,408

OVER A STUPID MOVIE.

SO I'M NOT GOING TO JUMP
TO ANY CONCLUSIONS.
