1
00:00:02,044 --> 00:00:04,630
WELL, HERE I AM,
BACK AT DEGRASSI.

2
00:00:04,713 --> 00:00:05,714
DO YOU MISS IT?

3
00:00:05,797 --> 00:00:08,675
NO. YALE ALREADY
FEELS LIKE HOME.

4
00:00:08,759 --> 00:00:09,927
I CAN'T BELIEVE I'M GONNA BE
LEAVING THIS BEHIND

5
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:11,386
IN TWO DAYS.

6
00:00:11,470 --> 00:00:13,138
YOUR PARENTS WANT YOU
BACK HOME IN NEW YORK,

7
00:00:13,222 --> 00:00:14,890
AND THAT IS PRETTY
UNDERSTANDABLE.

8
00:00:14,973 --> 00:00:16,183
YEAH,
BUT WHAT IS HOME?

9
00:00:16,266 --> 00:00:18,936
OUR FINANCES ARE FROZEN,
MY MOM'S UNDER HOUSE ARREST.

10
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:19,937
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT KIND OF LIFE

11
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:21,230
I'M GONNA BE GOING BACK TO.

12
00:00:21,313 --> 00:00:23,148
YOU'LL BE SURROUNDED
BY THE PEOPLE YOU LOVE.

13
00:00:23,232 --> 00:00:25,317
YEAH, WELL, AFTER I CANCEL
THE CARNIVAL I CAN'T PAY FOR,

14
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:27,110
I'M GONNA NEED TO BE.

15
00:00:27,194 --> 00:00:28,195
(GIGGLES)

16
00:00:31,114 --> 00:00:32,282
IMOGEN:
FIONA!

17
00:00:33,408 --> 00:00:36,411
I'VE SOLD EVERY LAST TICKET.
WE NEED MORE!

18
00:00:37,412 --> 00:00:39,081
HEY, I KNOW YOU.
HOLLY J!

19
00:00:39,164 --> 00:00:40,249
I'M JUST BACK
FOR THE HOLIDAYS.

20
00:00:40,332 --> 00:00:41,375
FROM YALE,
I KNOW!

21
00:00:41,458 --> 00:00:42,793
YOUR HAND PRINTS
ARE RIGHT THERE!

22
00:00:42,876 --> 00:00:44,753
IT'S LIKE I'M IN
THE PRESENCE OF ROYALTY.

23
00:00:44,837 --> 00:00:45,754
(GIGGLES)

24
00:00:45,838 --> 00:00:47,047
YOU MUST BE IMOGEN.

25
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:48,632
FIONA'S TOLD ME
ALL ABOUT YOU.

26
00:00:49,842 --> 00:00:51,885
AND SHE WAS JUST LEAVING!

27
00:00:51,969 --> 00:00:54,638
I WILL SEE YOU LATER.
GOOD LUCK.

28
00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:56,890
OKAY, SO I DREW UP
BLUEPRINTS.

29
00:00:59,101 --> 00:01:01,645
HERE IS THE FERRIS WHEEL,
CAROUSEL, CARNIVAL GAMES,

30
00:01:01,728 --> 00:01:04,147
ALONG WITH THE GENERATORS
AND ELECTRICAL DROPS.

31
00:01:04,231 --> 00:01:05,941
LOOKS GREAT, IMOGEN.
IT'S GREAT.

32
00:01:06,024 --> 00:01:07,860
WELL, I MEAN, YOU PUT UP
SO MUCH OF YOUR OWN MONEY

33
00:01:07,943 --> 00:01:10,195
TO MAKE THIS THE MOST
MIND-BLOWING FROSTIVAL EVER!

34
00:01:10,279 --> 00:01:11,196
IMOGEN...

35
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,991
NEXT TERM, YOU AND I WILL
RULE THE SCHOOL TOGETHER.

36
00:01:16,368 --> 00:01:17,494
IS EVERYTHING OKAY?

37
00:01:18,495 --> 00:01:21,081
OF COURSE.
THE SHOW MUST GO ON.

EVEN THOUGH THE GRUNDIES
DIDN'T NOMINATE MY PLAY,

58
00:02:19,014 --> 00:02:21,850
I TRIED TO REMAIN OBJECTIVE.

59
00:02:24,686 --> 00:02:25,687
I LOVE IT.

60
00:02:25,771 --> 00:02:27,397
AT NO POINT DID YOU CALL
THE GRUNDIES STUPID,

61
00:02:27,481 --> 00:02:29,233
POINTLESS,
OR MORONIC.

62
00:02:29,316 --> 00:02:30,609
YEAH, YOU SHOULD'VE SEEN
MY FIRST DRAFT.

63
00:02:30,692 --> 00:02:31,818
OH, SO YOU HAVEN'T
COMPLETELY GIVEN UP

64
00:02:31,902 --> 00:02:33,820
TAKING OUT YOUR FRUSTRATIONS
ON PAPER?

65
00:02:33,904 --> 00:02:35,197
NOPE. HI-YAH!

(LAUGHING)

67
00:02:36,323 --> 00:02:37,908
YOU KNOW, FOR PEOPLE
WHO HAVEN'T TALKED MUCH,

68
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:39,910
YOU TWO HAVEN'T MISSED A BEAT.

69
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:41,453
WELL, MAYBE WE SHOULD
TALK MORE.

70
00:02:41,537 --> 00:02:44,498
YOU WANNA GET LUNCH
TOGETHER?

71
00:02:45,707 --> 00:02:48,001
UM...
I DON'T THINK SO.

72
00:02:49,753 --> 00:02:52,589
ELI:
WELL, WHY NOT?
IT'S ONLY LUNCH, CLARE.

73
00:02:52,673 --> 00:02:54,341
IT'S JUST NOT
A GOOD IDEA.

74
00:02:56,677 --> 00:02:58,428
FINE. WHATEVER.

75
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:03,851
HARSH MUCH?

76
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:06,353
CLARE:
ELI'S COPING
WITH BIPOLAR DISORDER

77
00:03:06,436 --> 00:03:07,771
AND I DON'T WANT TO UPSET
THE BALANCE HE'S FOUND

78
00:03:07,855 --> 00:03:09,273
SINCE WE BROKE UP.

79
00:03:09,356 --> 00:03:10,941
CONNOR:
HE SEEMS BALANCED TO ME.

80
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:12,484
SHE DID IT FOR HIS OWN GOOD,
CONNOR.

81
00:03:12,568 --> 00:03:14,236
YOU WOULDN'T UNDERSTAND.

82
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:15,237
CONNOR:
I GUESS NOT.

83
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:17,364
BUT I HATE WHEN PEOPLE
DO THINGS FOR MY OWN GOOD.

84
00:03:22,786 --> 00:03:24,955
IMOGEN:
THE DEGRASSI FROSTIVAL CARNIVAL
IS ON!

85
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:27,332
DON'T MISS OUT ON THE MOST EPIC
EVENT OF THE SCHOOL YEAR!

86
00:03:27,416 --> 00:03:29,960
(KNOCKS)
IS MR. SIMPSON AVAILABLE?

87
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:33,255
MARISOL:
OH! LOOK WHO'S MEETING
WITH THE PRINCIPAL.

88
00:03:33,338 --> 00:03:34,715
WHAT DO YOU WANT,
MARISOL?

89
00:03:34,798 --> 00:03:36,758
YOU TO DELIVER
WHAT YOU PROMISED.

90
00:03:36,842 --> 00:03:38,552
(CELL RINGS)
I WILL.
REALLY?

91
00:03:38,635 --> 00:03:40,345
THERE'S A MESSAGE
FROM METRO EVENT RENTALS

92
00:03:40,429 --> 00:03:41,972
ON THE STUDENT COUNCIL PHONE.

93
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:43,599
THEY GOT YOUR DEPOSIT,

94
00:03:43,682 --> 00:03:45,851
AND ARE EXPECTING
THE OTHER ELEVEN GRAND

95
00:03:45,934 --> 00:03:46,852
WHEN THEY SHOW UP.

96
00:03:46,935 --> 00:03:47,853
YEAH.
THANKS FOR THE UPDATE.

97
00:03:47,936 --> 00:03:50,606
DID YOU HEAR THE PART
ABOUT THE ELEVEN GRAND?

98
00:03:50,689 --> 00:03:51,607
I KNOW YOU'RE SPOILED,

99
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:53,817
BUT DO YOU EVEN HAVE
ELEVEN GRAND?

100
00:03:53,901 --> 00:03:54,860
PLEASE GET OFF MY BACK.

101
00:03:54,943 --> 00:03:56,153
I JUST NEED TO TALK
TO SIMPSON.

102
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:59,239
BECAUSE YOUR CASHFLOW'S
DRIED UP?

103
00:03:59,323 --> 00:04:00,490
WHAT IF IT HAS?

104
00:04:00,574 --> 00:04:02,618
THEN WE HAVE PEE-O'D CARNIES
ON OUR HANDS,

105
00:04:02,701 --> 00:04:05,579
YOUR LITTLE SHOW-MARISOL-UP
PROJECT'S A BUST,

106
00:04:05,662 --> 00:04:06,830
AND THE STINK OF FAILURE

107
00:04:06,914 --> 00:04:09,917
FOLLOWS YOU AROUND
UNTIL GRADUATION.

108
00:04:10,918 --> 00:04:12,586
(GIGGLES)
GOOD LUCK!

109
00:04:17,299 --> 00:04:18,342
MAYA:
OH, HEY TORI!

110
00:04:18,425 --> 00:04:19,510
CAN I ASK YOU SOMETHING?

111
00:04:19,593 --> 00:04:21,512
LOOK WHO IT IS -
THE BAND DITCHER.

112
00:04:21,595 --> 00:04:23,388
IT'S NOTHING PERSONAL,

113
00:04:23,472 --> 00:04:26,016
I HAD TO DO IT
FOR MY SANITY.

114
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:28,185
FINE.
WHAT DO YOU NEED?

115
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:29,186
I'M TRYING TO DECIDE

116
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:30,979
WHAT SHIRT I SHOULD WEAR
TO MY AUDITION.

117
00:04:31,063 --> 00:04:32,314
AN AUDITION?
FOR WHAT?

118
00:04:32,397 --> 00:04:33,482
AN INDIE BAND.

119
00:04:33,565 --> 00:04:35,150
IT'S AT A CLUB.
THEY HAVE SHOWS LINED UP!

120
00:04:35,234 --> 00:04:36,109
THEY'RE TOTALLY REAL!

121
00:04:36,193 --> 00:04:38,570
WOW!
THAT'S AMAZING!

122
00:04:38,654 --> 00:04:39,571
YOU'LL FINALLY GET
TO SHOW-OFF

123
00:04:39,655 --> 00:04:41,198
YOUR CELLO CHOPS!

124
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:42,908
PROMISE YOU'LL SNEAK ME
INTO YOUR FIRST SHOW.

125
00:04:42,991 --> 00:04:45,160
CROSS MY HEART.
SO?

126
00:04:45,244 --> 00:04:47,538
UM...WEAR THIS.

127
00:04:48,539 --> 00:04:50,207
AND MAYBE EXPOSE
A SHOULDER?

128
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:51,708
ARE YOU SURE?

129
00:04:51,792 --> 00:04:52,751
YOU MAY HAVE DITCHED
OUR BAND,

130
00:04:52,835 --> 00:04:55,546
BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN
I'D LEAD YOU ASTRAY.

131
00:04:55,629 --> 00:04:56,880
(SIGHS)
THANKS, TORI.

132
00:04:58,048 --> 00:04:59,049
(KNOCKS)

133
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:03,720
I DON'T NEED THIS,
MS. COYNE.

134
00:05:03,804 --> 00:05:04,721
SIR, I KNOW.

135
00:05:04,805 --> 00:05:06,974
I'M JUST HAVING
A TINY LITTLE ISSUE

136
00:05:07,057 --> 00:05:08,100
WITH THE CARNIVAL RENTALS.

137
00:05:08,183 --> 00:05:10,352
YEAH! I HAD NO IDEA
THAT YOU WERE GONNA BOOK

138
00:05:10,435 --> 00:05:11,770
ACTUAL CARNIVAL RIDES.

139
00:05:11,854 --> 00:05:12,855
I THOUGHT IT WAS
JUST A THEME!

140
00:05:12,938 --> 00:05:13,856
I THOUGHT...

141
00:05:13,939 --> 00:05:15,983
I THOUGHT IT WAS GONNA BE
CARDBOARD CUTOUTS!

142
00:05:16,066 --> 00:05:17,776
OKAY, I MAY HAVE OVER-PROMISED
JUST A TAD,

143
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:20,070
BUT I KNOW HOW
I CAN MAKE IT WORK.

144
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:21,780
OKAY, WE OPEN IT UP,

145
00:05:21,864 --> 00:05:23,240
GET THE WHOLE COMMUNITY
INVOLVED,

146
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:24,950
ADVERTISE ONLINE,
HOLD A RAFFLE,

147
00:05:25,033 --> 00:05:25,951
STAY OPEN LATER.

148
00:05:26,034 --> 00:05:29,538
YOU PROMISED ME A SAFE, DAYTIME,
DEGRASSI-ONLY EVENT.

149
00:05:29,621 --> 00:05:31,373
OKAY, A) THE SUN GOES DOWN
AT FIVE,

150
00:05:31,456 --> 00:05:32,457
AND B) I WAS THINKING-

151
00:05:32,541 --> 00:05:33,458
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA

152
00:05:33,542 --> 00:05:35,210
HOW MUCH SECURITY
I'D HAVE TO HIRE?

153
00:05:35,294 --> 00:05:36,211
I'M NOT ABOUT
TO TAKE A CHANCE

154
00:05:36,295 --> 00:05:38,005
ON ANOTHER DEGRASSI EVENT
TURNING VIOLENT.

155
00:05:38,088 --> 00:05:39,339
OKAY, BUT YOU'RE NOT THINKING
ABOUT HOW MUCH FUN

156
00:05:39,423 --> 00:05:40,382
THIS COULD BE!

157
00:05:40,465 --> 00:05:43,260
NO. I'M THINKING ABOUT
THE SAFETY OF MY STUDENTS.

158
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:45,637
ALL YOU CARE ABOUT ARE RULES,
AND DRESS CODES,

159
00:05:45,721 --> 00:05:46,722
AND SMOTHERING DREAMS.

160
00:05:46,805 --> 00:05:48,182
YOU'RE A COG IN THE MACHINE,
SIR!

161
00:05:48,265 --> 00:05:49,433
I KNOW, I'M ANOTHER BRICK
IN THE WALL.

162
00:05:49,516 --> 00:05:52,477
LOOK, YOU SAID YOU COULD
PULL THIS OFF.

163
00:05:52,561 --> 00:05:55,147
SCALE IT DOWN,
GET IT DONE. DEAL?

164
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:57,524
OKAY.
THANK YOU, SIR.

165
00:06:02,029 --> 00:06:03,530
(HEAVY SIGH)

166
00:06:15,417 --> 00:06:18,462
SO I MAY HAVE JUMPED
TO CONCLUSIONS ABOUT LUNCH.

167
00:06:18,545 --> 00:06:19,630
WHEN YOU ASKED,
I PANICKED.

168
00:06:19,713 --> 00:06:22,090
I'M SORRY.

169
00:06:22,174 --> 00:06:24,843
ARE YOU GOING
TO SIT DOWN?

170
00:06:31,892 --> 00:06:33,727
SOUP, HUH?

171
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:35,646
YEAH.
CAULIFLOWER.

172
00:06:35,729 --> 00:06:37,981
MMM...
GOTTA LOVE CAULIFLOWER.

173
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:46,240
LOOK, I DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHY THINGS HAVE TO BE AWKWARD.

174
00:06:46,323 --> 00:06:47,449
ALL OF OUR FEELINGS
FOR EACH OTHER -

175
00:06:47,533 --> 00:06:48,825
THAT'S ALL IN THE PAST.

176
00:06:48,909 --> 00:06:52,579
YEAH! I MEAN,
IT'S NOT ABOUT OUR FEELINGS,

177
00:06:52,663 --> 00:06:54,164
WHICH ARE TOTALLY HISTORY.

178
00:06:54,248 --> 00:06:55,999
OKAY,
THEN LET'S BREAK THE ICE.

179
00:06:56,083 --> 00:06:57,626
ONE QUESTION EACH,
ANYTHING YOU WANT.

180
00:06:57,709 --> 00:06:58,877
OKAY.

181
00:06:59,878 --> 00:07:01,129
YOU FIRST.

182
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:02,965
(EXHALES)

183
00:07:03,966 --> 00:07:06,218
DO YOU THINK WE COULD EVER
PICK UP WHERE WE LEFT OFF?

184
00:07:06,301 --> 00:07:10,138
I MEAN, BEFORE WE WENT OUT,
AND BEFORE MY ISSUES.

185
00:07:10,222 --> 00:07:12,516
UM... ELI, I...

186
00:07:12,599 --> 00:07:14,309
I MEAN,
YOU'RE DOING SO WELL,

187
00:07:14,393 --> 00:07:17,229
I DON'T WANNA BE A TRIGGER
FOR YOUR ISSUES.

188
00:07:17,312 --> 00:07:19,273
WHY WOULD YOU BE?
OH! HOT!

189
00:07:19,356 --> 00:07:20,649
OHMYGOD! OHMYGOD!

190
00:07:20,732 --> 00:07:23,068
OHMYGOD!
I'M SO SORRY!

191
00:07:26,071 --> 00:07:27,990
UH, IT'S OKAY.

192
00:07:28,073 --> 00:07:29,700
IT'S JUST CAULIFLOWER.

193
00:07:30,701 --> 00:07:31,869
(PAINED GRUNT)

194
00:07:31,952 --> 00:07:34,413
I...
I RUINED YOUR PANTS.

195
00:07:35,414 --> 00:07:37,958
UH, SCHOOL UNIFORM PANTS?

196
00:07:38,041 --> 00:07:39,960
I'LL GET OVER IT.

197
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:46,717
SO YOU GONNA ASK
YOUR QUESTION?

198
00:07:49,136 --> 00:07:52,097
WOULD YOU REWRITE
JENNA'S MUSIC REVIEW?

199
00:07:52,181 --> 00:07:54,641
KEEPING IT PROFESSIONAL,
HUH?

200
00:07:54,725 --> 00:07:55,726
SURE.

201
00:07:57,853 --> 00:07:58,979
ALL RIGHT.

202
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:01,648
I NEED TISSUES.

203
00:08:05,068 --> 00:08:06,236
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
HOW MANY TIMES

204
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:08,071
I'VE PACKED THESE SUITCASES?

205
00:08:08,155 --> 00:08:09,740
ONCE?

206
00:08:09,823 --> 00:08:11,783
YEAH.
THESE ARE NEW.

207
00:08:11,867 --> 00:08:13,410
BUT I'VE LIVED HERE
FOR TWO YEARS.

208
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:15,621
THAT'S LONGER
THAN ANYWHERE ELSE.

209
00:08:15,704 --> 00:08:16,622
ARE YOU HAVING
SECOND THOUGHTS

210
00:08:16,705 --> 00:08:17,831
ABOUT LEAVING THIS WEEKEND?

211
00:08:17,915 --> 00:08:19,416
YEAH.
ACTUALLY, I AM.

212
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:21,585
WHY WAIT FOR THE WEEKEND?

213
00:08:21,668 --> 00:08:22,920
I MEAN, I'VE MADE A MESS
OF EVERYTHING.

214
00:08:23,003 --> 00:08:25,547
I MIGHT AS WELL JUST GO NOW,
FLY STANDBY.

215
00:08:25,631 --> 00:08:26,882
WHAT ABOUT IMOGEN?

216
00:08:26,965 --> 00:08:28,008
I'LL SAVE THE STRAIGHT GIRL
I HAVE A CRUSH ON

217
00:08:28,091 --> 00:08:29,259
A WHOLE BUNCH OF TROUBLE.

218
00:08:29,343 --> 00:08:31,094
SHE'LL THANK ME SOMEDAY.

219
00:08:31,178 --> 00:08:32,804
WHATEVER YOU SAY.
I'M JUST HERE TO HELP.

220
00:08:32,888 --> 00:08:34,223
THEN HELP.

221
00:08:35,349 --> 00:08:36,350
(BUZZER RINGS)

222
00:08:37,809 --> 00:08:38,977
I GUESS WE'VE GOT
A VISITOR.

223
00:08:41,021 --> 00:08:42,523
IMOGEN:
OH, HOLLY J!

224
00:08:43,524 --> 00:08:45,817
WHO'S UP FOR A LATE-NIGHT
SNOWFLAKE-CUTOUT BASH?

225
00:08:45,901 --> 00:08:47,444
IF WE WANNA GET THE FROSTIVAL
DECORATED IN TIME-

226
00:08:47,528 --> 00:08:49,613
FIONA:
IMOGEN! THERE ARE MORE
IMPORTANT THINGS IN LIFE

227
00:08:49,696 --> 00:08:51,240
THAN A STUPID CARNIVAL,
OKAY?

228
00:08:51,323 --> 00:08:53,784
IMOGEN:
WHY ARE YOU YELLING AT ME?

229
00:08:53,867 --> 00:08:55,577
AND WHY ARE YOU PACKING?

230
00:08:55,661 --> 00:08:56,703
THERE'S JUST A LOT OF THINGS
GOING ON WITH ME

231
00:08:56,787 --> 00:08:59,122
THAT YOU DON'T KNOW ABOUT.

232
00:09:00,123 --> 00:09:02,125
YOU CAN TELL ME ANYTHING.

233
00:09:03,627 --> 00:09:05,754
MY FAMILY'S
IN SERIOUS TROUBLE.

234
00:09:05,838 --> 00:09:06,922
FOR THE FIRST TIME
IN MY LIFE,

235
00:09:07,005 --> 00:09:09,675
I'M BROKE.

236
00:09:09,758 --> 00:09:10,968
OKAY.

237
00:09:11,051 --> 00:09:13,011
WELL, YOU STILL HAVE
YOUR HEALTH.

238
00:09:13,095 --> 00:09:14,429
IT'S NOT FUNNY.

239
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:16,557
I'M JUST TRYING TO LOOK
ON THE BRIGHT SIDE.

240
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,892
THERE IS NO BRIGHT SIDE!

241
00:09:18,976 --> 00:09:20,853
I CAME BACK TO DEGRASSI
TO PROVE MYSELF,

242
00:09:20,936 --> 00:09:23,021
BUT I GOT BULLIED
OUT OF STUDENT COUNCIL,

243
00:09:23,105 --> 00:09:25,190
MY MARKS ARE MEDIOCRE,
THE CARNIVAL'S A BUST-

244
00:09:25,274 --> 00:09:26,275
WHAT?!

245
00:09:27,901 --> 00:09:29,194
(SIGHS)

246
00:09:29,278 --> 00:09:30,988
I FAILED.

247
00:09:31,071 --> 00:09:33,073
SO TOMORROW I'M MOVING BACK
TO NEW YORK.

248
00:09:33,156 --> 00:09:35,158
I THINK YOU SHOULD
JUST GO.

249
00:09:37,452 --> 00:09:38,829
FINE.

250
00:09:38,912 --> 00:09:41,331
RUN AWAY.
BE A QUITTER.

251
00:09:49,631 --> 00:09:50,632
(CHUCKLES)

252
00:09:53,051 --> 00:09:54,386
(EXCITED EXHALE)

253
00:10:00,893 --> 00:10:05,105
MR. MATLIN:
WHERE DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE GOING?

254
00:10:05,189 --> 00:10:07,024
AND WHAT ARE YOU WEARING?

255
00:10:07,107 --> 00:10:08,609
I THOUGHT YOU AND MOM
WERE SLEEPING.

256
00:10:08,692 --> 00:10:09,610
MR. MATLIN:
WELL, EVEN IF WE WERE,

257
00:10:09,693 --> 00:10:10,944
THAT DOESN'T GIVE YOU PERMISSION
TO LEAVE THIS HOUSE.

258
00:10:11,028 --> 00:10:12,070
DAD, I HAVE TO.

259
00:10:12,154 --> 00:10:13,947
I HAVE AN AUDITION
AT LEE'S PALACE!

260
00:10:14,031 --> 00:10:15,657
MR. MATLIN:
THAT'S A BAR!

261
00:10:15,741 --> 00:10:16,950
YOU'RE THIRTEEN!

262
00:10:17,034 --> 00:10:20,537
WELL, IT'S NOT LIKE
I'M GONNA DRINK.

263
00:10:22,706 --> 00:10:24,374
MAYA, WHAT'S WRONG?

264
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:27,920
I DON'T FEEL CHALLENGED,
DAD.

265
00:10:28,003 --> 00:10:31,924
I DON'T HAVE A MILLION
ACTIVITIES LIKE KATIE.

266
00:10:32,007 --> 00:10:34,676
MUSIC IS EVERYTHING
TO ME

267
00:10:35,761 --> 00:10:38,722
AND I JUST FEEL LIKE
I'M LOSING THAT.

268
00:10:38,805 --> 00:10:41,350
WE'VE BEEN SO FOCUSED ON KATIE
AND HER REHAB LATELY-

269
00:10:41,433 --> 00:10:43,352
SQUEAKY WHEEL
GETS THE GREASE.

270
00:10:43,435 --> 00:10:45,729
IF YOU WANT IT,
YOU'LL ALWAYS HAVE MUSIC.

271
00:10:45,812 --> 00:10:49,358
YOU JUST HAVE TO FIND A WAY
TO CHALLENGE YOURSELF.

272
00:10:49,441 --> 00:10:50,776
ALL RIGHT?

273
00:10:52,694 --> 00:10:54,363
ALL RIGHT. BED.

274
00:11:00,577 --> 00:11:05,082
HOLLY J:
(SIGHS) I HOPE YOU DON'T
EXPECT ME TO FOLD ALL THAT.

275
00:11:05,165 --> 00:11:06,959
FIONA?

276
00:11:07,042 --> 00:11:08,877
IMOGEN'S RIGHT;
I'M A QUITTER.

277
00:11:08,961 --> 00:11:12,047
A SPOILED BRAT WHO GIVES UP
THE MINUTE THINGS GET HARD.

278
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:13,090
YOU GAVE UP DRINKING...

279
00:11:13,173 --> 00:11:14,716
YEAH,
I HAVE MY HEALTH.

280
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,802
MAYBE THAT'S ALL I NEED.

281
00:11:16,885 --> 00:11:17,886
I MEAN, LOOK AT ALL
THIS JUNK!

282
00:11:17,970 --> 00:11:20,556
I DON'T NEED ANY OF IT.

283
00:11:20,639 --> 00:11:22,891
DOESN'T REALLY SEEM
THAT IMPORTANT ANYMORE, DOES IT?

284
00:11:22,975 --> 00:11:25,686
COMPARED TO, SAY,
A STUPID CARNIVAL.

285
00:11:27,521 --> 00:11:29,273
I NEED TO RAISE SOME CASH.

286
00:11:29,356 --> 00:11:31,608
FIRST THING TOMORROW,
LET'S HAVE A FIRE SALE.

287
00:11:31,692 --> 00:11:33,819
WE'LL ADVERTISE ONLINE,
PUT STUFF ON EBAY...

288
00:11:33,902 --> 00:11:35,404
ALL THIS JUNK'S GOTTA GO!

289
00:11:35,487 --> 00:11:37,489
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE A SALE
ON ONE NIGHT'S NOTICE?

290
00:11:37,573 --> 00:11:38,699
WELL, IT'S NOT
GONNA BE EASY,

291
00:11:38,782 --> 00:11:40,450
BUT I CAN'T QUIT.

292
00:11:40,534 --> 00:11:42,744
NOT ON IMOGEN,
NOT ON THE CARNIVAL,

293
00:11:42,828 --> 00:11:43,745
NOT THIS TIME.

294
00:11:43,829 --> 00:11:46,081
SOUNDS LIKE FROSTIVAL'S
A GO!

295
00:11:46,164 --> 00:11:49,001
YEAH. AND IT BETTER
BE EPIC.

296
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:53,839

297
00:11:53,922 --> 00:11:55,632

302
00:12:04,099 --> 00:12:08,437
FIONA:
HEY, IMOGEN, IT'S ME AGAIN.
THIRD TIME!

303
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:09,938
LOOK, IF YOU'RE NOT GONNA
CALL ME BACK,

304
00:12:10,022 --> 00:12:12,566
I HOPE YOU'LL AT LEAST COME
TO DEGRASSI THIS AFTERNOON.

305
00:12:12,649 --> 00:12:15,569
I HAVE SOMETHING
I WANT YOU TO SEE.

306
00:12:17,237 --> 00:12:19,448
I'LL GIVE YOU FIFTY
FOR THIS.

307
00:12:19,531 --> 00:12:20,991
DO YOU EVEN HEAR
YOURSELF?

308
00:12:21,074 --> 00:12:23,619
THAT KARA ROSS IS WORTH
$1500 DOLLARS NEW.

309
00:12:23,702 --> 00:12:26,788
A HUNDRED.
BUT THAT'S ALL I HAVE.

310
00:12:26,872 --> 00:12:29,458
SOLD.
YOU'RE A VULTURE.

311
00:12:29,541 --> 00:12:32,252
I'LL TAKE THAT
AS A COMPLIMENT!

312
00:12:33,253 --> 00:12:37,424
HOLLY J:
UH, WE JUST GOT A $600 DOLLAR
BID ON YOUR LOUBOUTINS!

313
00:12:37,508 --> 00:12:39,259
WHICH ONES?
THE BLACK BOOTIES?

314
00:12:39,343 --> 00:12:42,012
OKAY, GOOD. KEEP AN EYE
ON THE REST OF THEM.

315
00:12:42,095 --> 00:12:44,139
FOR THE LAST TIME,
ARE YOU SURE ABOUT THIS?

316
00:12:44,223 --> 00:12:46,141
FOR THE LAST TIME,
YES!

317
00:12:46,225 --> 00:12:49,228
WELL, IN THAT CASE...
PRICE CHECK?

318
00:12:50,229 --> 00:12:51,855
MAKE AN OFFER.

319
00:12:53,815 --> 00:12:54,733
I TAKE YOUR SIDE

320
00:12:54,816 --> 00:12:57,027
WHEN YOU TELL YOUR MOM
WHAT YOU'RE DOING?

321
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:58,987
AND TWENTY BUCKS.

322
00:12:59,071 --> 00:13:01,907
WHAT?
I HAVE CARNIES TO PAY!

323
00:13:05,077 --> 00:13:06,245
COME ON, GUYS!

324
00:13:16,922 --> 00:13:18,090
MARISOL:
YOU'RE HERE!

325
00:13:18,173 --> 00:13:20,551
PLEASE TELL ME I WON'T HAVE
TO DEAL WITH ANGRY CARNIES.

326
00:13:20,634 --> 00:13:21,927
FIONA:
IT'S ALL THERE,

327
00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:23,971
PLUS A GENEROUS TIP
FOR THE LAST MINUTE SETUP.

328
00:13:24,054 --> 00:13:26,765
NO NEED TO BANKRUPT
STUDENT COUNCIL.

329
00:13:26,849 --> 00:13:28,350
I GUESS I SHOULD HAVE
TRUSTED FIONA COYNE

330
00:13:28,433 --> 00:13:30,227
TO COME THROUGH
WITH CASH.

331
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:31,687
YEAH.
FOR THE LAST TIME EVER.

332
00:13:31,770 --> 00:13:32,980
WHAT? I WAS JUST
STARTING TO SEE

333
00:13:33,063 --> 00:13:35,023
HOW YOU COULD BE USEFUL
FOR NEXT TERM.

334
00:13:35,107 --> 00:13:37,734
SORRY, YOU'LL HAVE TO RULE
THE SCHOOL ALL ALONE.

335
00:13:37,818 --> 00:13:38,735
I'M MOVING AWAY.

336
00:13:38,819 --> 00:13:39,820
SERIOUSLY?

337
00:13:40,946 --> 00:13:45,284
THEN I REALLY HOPE KATIE'S
NOT GONE TOO LONG.

338
00:13:45,367 --> 00:13:47,703
SO WHERE'S YOUR SIDEKICK?

339
00:13:47,786 --> 00:13:49,913
I DON'T KNOW.
SHE'S MAD AT ME.

340
00:13:49,997 --> 00:13:51,874
YOU TWO ARE DRAMA!

341
00:13:52,875 --> 00:13:54,501
WELL, I'D BETTER PAY
THE CARNIES,

342
00:13:54,585 --> 00:13:56,587
AND MAKE SURE MO
GETS OFF THE FERRIS WHEEL

343
00:13:56,670 --> 00:13:59,506
BEFORE HE UP-CHUCKS
ALL FOUR CANDY APPLES.

344
00:13:59,590 --> 00:14:00,591
FIONA:
EW!

345
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:06,388
IMOGEN:
EXCUSE ME, WHICH WAY
TO THE FREAK SHOW?

346
00:14:06,471 --> 00:14:07,598

YOU WERE AVOIDING ME.

YOU COULD DO ANYTHING.

HAVE YOU PLAYED TRUMPET
BEFORE?

371
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:01,527
