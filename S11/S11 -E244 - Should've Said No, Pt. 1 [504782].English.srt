1
00:00:01,293 --> 00:00:05,255
CLARE:
ALLI, ALL I SAID WAS HE'S TALL
AND HE HAS A TRUCK.

2
00:00:05,339 --> 00:00:09,801
NO, I NEVER SAID JAKE MARTIN
IS HOTTER THAN MOLTEN LAVA.

3
00:00:09,885 --> 00:00:12,429
WELL, HE CERTAINLY LACKS
HIS FATHER'S CHARM, BUT...

4
00:00:12,513 --> 00:00:13,430
UH, GLENN...

5
00:00:13,514 --> 00:00:16,266
YOU KNOW JAKE
IS A GREAT YOUNG MAN.

6
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:19,019
VERY... STRAPPING.

7
00:00:21,188 --> 00:00:22,689
WELL, IF YOU WANT
TO SAY HELLO,

8
00:00:22,773 --> 00:00:24,775
HE'S IN THE KITCHEN
CLEANING UP.

9
00:00:24,858 --> 00:00:26,568
HE CAME OVER TO HELP ME
WITH THE RENO.

10
00:00:28,779 --> 00:00:29,530
(EXHALES)

11
00:00:38,539 --> 00:00:39,915
JAKE:
HOW LONG HAVE YOU
BEEN THERE?

12
00:00:39,998 --> 00:00:42,251
A-A MINUTE.
LESS THAN A MINUTE.

13
00:00:42,334 --> 00:00:44,711
LIKE, MORE LIKE A SECOND,
BUT...

14
00:00:44,795 --> 00:00:47,047
DO YOU OFTEN GET CHANGED
IN OTHER PEOPLE'S KITCHENS?

15
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:48,632
I DIDN'T KNOW
I HAD AN AUDIENCE.

16
00:00:49,633 --> 00:00:51,385
I WASN'T STARING,
IF THAT'S WHAT YOU THINK.

17
00:00:51,468 --> 00:00:54,513
(LAUGHS)
IT'S OKAY IF YOU WERE.

18
00:00:54,596 --> 00:00:56,348
WELL, I WASN'T.

19
00:00:59,685 --> 00:01:01,603
I HAVE HOMEWORK.

20
00:01:01,687 --> 00:01:03,939
OKAY. SEE YOU AROUND.

21
00:01:04,982 --> 00:01:05,983
OKAY.

22
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:13,991

SO DID JAKE LOOK GOOD?
I BET HE DID.

40
00:02:04,541 --> 00:02:06,877
CLARE:
ALLI, I HAVE ONE HOUR
TO FINISH MY ARTICLE

41
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,253
ON THE CONCEPT
FOR THE SCHOOL PLAY,

42
00:02:08,337 --> 00:02:11,215
WHICH ACCORDING TO ELI
IS THE STORY OF CLARA,

43
00:02:11,298 --> 00:02:13,842
A PSYCHOPATH WHO DESTROYS
EVERYTHING IN HER PATH.

44
00:02:13,926 --> 00:02:16,720
SO I'M SO NOT IN THE MOOD
TO TALK ABOUT THIS RIGHT NOW.

45
00:02:16,803 --> 00:02:19,681
FINE, BUT YOU'D BETTER
DRAW ME A PICTURE LATER.

46
00:02:19,765 --> 00:02:21,350
BOTH:
(GIGGLE)

47
00:02:21,433 --> 00:02:24,561
KATIE:
JAKE, SO GLAD YOU COULD BE PART
OF MY PROFILE ON NEW STUDENTS.

48
00:02:24,645 --> 00:02:26,355
SO, TELL ME,

49
00:02:26,438 --> 00:02:28,649
HAVE YOUR FIRST WEEKS
AT DEGRASSI BEEN EASY?

50
00:02:28,732 --> 00:02:31,401
JAKE:
(SIGHS) WELL, SOME PEOPLE
HAVE SURPRISED ME.

51
00:02:31,485 --> 00:02:32,903
KATIE:
THAT'S GOOD, ISN'T IT?

52
00:02:32,986 --> 00:02:35,364
JAKE:
ABSOLUTELY!
BECAUSE AS A NEW STUDENT,

53
00:02:35,447 --> 00:02:36,698
YOU FEEL NAKED.

54
00:02:36,782 --> 00:02:39,201
LIKE ALL EYES ARE ON YOU,
STARING...

55
00:02:39,284 --> 00:02:40,744
UNABLE TO LOOK AWAY.

56
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:42,246
KATIE:
SOUNDS LIKE
MY WORST NIGHTMARE.

57
00:02:42,329 --> 00:02:43,330
WELL, DEPENDS ON
WHO'S LOOKING.

58
00:02:46,458 --> 00:02:48,836
ALLI:
AH... FIRST MOVIE NIGHT
OF THE SEMESTER.

59
00:02:48,919 --> 00:02:51,421
WE NEED A FILM
THAT'S EPIC AND ICONIC.

60
00:02:51,505 --> 00:02:53,382
WHAT ABOUT GREASE?
WE COULD DO A SING-A-LONG.

61
00:02:53,465 --> 00:02:55,092
SO WE'RE PLANNING
AN ALL-GIRLS MOVIE NIGHT?

62
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:57,010
AND WHAT DO YOU SUGGEST?
A KUNG-FU MOVIE?

63
00:02:57,094 --> 00:02:58,011
NO, A CLASSIC COMEDY.

64
00:02:58,095 --> 00:03:00,430
UH, MARX BROTHERS,
CHAPLIN...

65
00:03:00,514 --> 00:03:01,974
WHAT ABOUT ZOMBIES?

66
00:03:02,057 --> 00:03:04,977
OR ZOMBIES!
OF COURSE, ZOMBIES!

67
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:06,645
WHY'D WE STOP
HANGING OUT AGAIN?

68
00:03:06,728 --> 00:03:08,564
'CAUSE YOU STARTED DATING
DREAMY TORRES.

69
00:03:08,647 --> 00:03:11,775
RIGHT, NOT THE SMARTEST
DECISION EVER MADE.

70
00:03:11,859 --> 00:03:13,110
WE SHOULD CATCH UP.

71
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:14,236
WANNA GO FOR WINGS,
TOMORROW NIGHT,

72
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:16,321
AFTER WE POSTER
FOR MOVIE NIGHT?

73
00:03:16,405 --> 00:03:17,489
YEAH, SOUNDS GOOD.

74
00:03:17,573 --> 00:03:18,866
I'LL HAVE TO CHECK
WITH SADIE THOUGH.

75
00:03:18,949 --> 00:03:19,867
GOOD LUCK.

76
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:21,034
GIRLFRIENDS DON'T
LET BOYFRIENDS

77
00:03:21,118 --> 00:03:22,160
HANG OUT WITH GIRL FRIENDS

78
00:03:22,244 --> 00:03:25,122
'CAUSE THEY'RE AFRAID
THAT WILL HAPPEN.

79
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:27,457
WHAT? NO. KC AND MARISOL
ARE JUST FRIENDS.

80
00:03:27,541 --> 00:03:28,876
LIKE US.

81
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:29,960
WHICH IS WHY SADIE
WILL HAVE NO PROBLEM

82
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:31,003
WITH US HANGING OUT.

83
00:03:31,086 --> 00:03:34,298
TEN DOLLARS SAYS
YOU ARE WRONG.

84
00:03:34,381 --> 00:03:36,049
SADIE TRUSTS ME.

85
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:40,345
THEN I'LL SEE YOU
TOMORROW NIGHT.

86
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:42,931
(CHUCKLES)

87
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:46,894
DO YOU HAVE
YOUR CELL PHONE?

88
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:50,230
OKAY, I PROGRAMMED
OFFICER TURNER'S NUMBER.

89
00:03:50,314 --> 00:03:52,107
SO IF YOU NOTICE
ANYTHING SUSPICIOUS-

90
00:03:52,191 --> 00:03:54,610
MA, ARE YOU GOING TO BE
LIKE THIS EVERY DAY?

91
00:03:54,693 --> 00:03:57,029
HONEY, IT'S YOUR FIRST DAY
BACK AT SCHOOL SINCE-

92
00:03:57,112 --> 00:03:58,989
ADAM:
THOSE GANG MEMBERS WENT
GRAND THEFT AUTO ON YOUR BUTT.

93
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:00,073
ADAM!

94
00:04:01,491 --> 00:04:03,118
LISTEN, ONE MORE DAY
AT HOME WOULDN'T HURT.

95
00:04:03,202 --> 00:04:05,370
I-I COULD CANCEL
MY MEETINGS.

96
00:04:05,454 --> 00:04:06,705
I HAVE A NUMBER
OF A PSYCHOLOGIST-

97
00:04:06,788 --> 00:04:08,457
OKAY, MOM, ENOUGH.

98
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:09,458
I SPENT A MONTH

99
00:04:09,541 --> 00:04:10,709
DEALING WITH THE AFTERMATH
OF SPRING BREAK.

100
00:04:10,792 --> 00:04:12,336
I WANT FUN,
I WANT FRIENDS,

101
00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:13,670
I WANT MY OLD LIFE BACK.

102
00:04:13,754 --> 00:04:15,672
(CHUCKLES)
YEAH, I KNOW DREW, BUT...

103
00:04:15,756 --> 00:04:16,673
NO BUTS.

104
00:04:16,757 --> 00:04:19,885
THE COPS ARE WATCHING
THE GUYS WHO BEAT ME UP.

105
00:04:19,968 --> 00:04:20,928
IT'S TIME TO MOVE ON,

106
00:04:21,011 --> 00:04:22,763
AND GOING BACK TO SCHOOL
IS THE BEST WAY I KNOW HOW.

107
00:04:22,846 --> 00:04:24,932
(SCHOOL BELL RINGS)

108
00:04:34,316 --> 00:04:36,318
STUDENT:
WATCH IT!

109
00:04:38,779 --> 00:04:41,281
I HATE HIM. I HATE HIM.
I HATE HIM.

110
00:04:41,365 --> 00:04:42,533
ELI?

111
00:04:42,616 --> 00:04:45,160
WHY CAN'T I STOP PICTURING
HIS HALF-NAKED BODY?

112
00:04:45,244 --> 00:04:46,203
DEFINITELY NOT ELI.

113
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:47,955
IT'S LIKE HE KNOWS
WHAT I'M THINKING

114
00:04:48,038 --> 00:04:49,331
AND HE'S MOCKING ME.

115
00:04:49,414 --> 00:04:51,375
MAYBE HE LIKES YOU.

116
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:52,376
DON'T SAY THAT.

117
00:04:52,459 --> 00:04:54,086
WHAT? HE'S CUTE,
SINGLE,

118
00:04:54,169 --> 00:04:55,838
HE DOESN'T DRIVE
HEARSES INTO WALLS.

119
00:04:55,921 --> 00:04:56,839
YOU DON'T KNOW THAT.

120
00:04:56,922 --> 00:04:57,965
HE COULD BE
A HOMICIDAL MANIAC

121
00:04:58,048 --> 00:05:01,927
WHO LURES GIRLS IN
WITH HIS SEXY SMILE. UGH.

122
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:03,595
OR THE PERFECT REBOUND.

123
00:05:04,596 --> 00:05:07,015
OKAY,
MY EX HAS WRITTEN A PLAY

124
00:05:07,099 --> 00:05:08,642
THAT PAINTS ME
AS A PSYCHOPATH.

125
00:05:08,725 --> 00:05:11,687
MY MOM IS THROWING PARTIES
TO CELEBRATE HER DIVORCE.

126
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:12,688
GIVE ME ONE REASON

127
00:05:12,771 --> 00:05:15,232
WHY I WOULD WANT TO START
A RELATIONSHIP WITH JAKE.

128
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:16,733
BECAUSE YOU CAN'T STOP
THINKING

129
00:05:16,817 --> 00:05:18,610
ABOUT HIS SEXY SMILE.

130
00:05:21,363 --> 00:05:22,281
WELL, I AM CERTAINLY
GOING TO TRY.

131
00:05:22,364 --> 00:05:24,908
BETENKAMP:
OKAY, WE'VE COVERED
THE HEART.

132
00:05:24,992 --> 00:05:27,911
ON TO THE REPRODUCTIVE ORGANS.

133
00:05:38,922 --> 00:05:41,884
DREW:
INTRAMURAL DODGEBALL CAPTAINS,
MEET YOUR NEW MVP.

134
00:05:41,967 --> 00:05:42,968
KC:
YOU ARE JUST IN TIME.

135
00:05:43,051 --> 00:05:44,553
WE GOT SMOKED
IN OUR LAST GAME.

136
00:05:44,636 --> 00:05:46,096
MARISOL:
YOU UH...
SURE YOU'RE UP FOR IT?

137
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:48,098
WORD IS THAT GANG
PRACTICALLY KILLED YOU.

138
00:05:48,182 --> 00:05:49,975
THERE WERE, LIKE,
TEN GUYS, RIGHT?

139
00:05:50,058 --> 00:05:52,144
ARE THEY STILL AFTER YOU?
(GASP) GOD, I BET THEY ARE.

140
00:05:52,227 --> 00:05:53,562
YOU MUST BE SO SCARED.

141
00:05:53,645 --> 00:05:54,605
I'M FINE.

142
00:05:54,688 --> 00:05:56,690
REALLY?
C-CAUSE I'D BE TERRIFIED.

143
00:05:56,773 --> 00:05:57,774
KC:
MARE...

144
00:05:59,276 --> 00:06:00,444
GIVE US A SEC?

145
00:06:00,527 --> 00:06:02,446
YEAH. SURE.

146
00:06:07,618 --> 00:06:08,619
YOU OKAY, DUDE?

147
00:06:08,702 --> 00:06:09,953
I'M FINE.

148
00:06:10,037 --> 00:06:14,416
LOOK, YOU'RE NOT THE ONLY ONE
WHO'S BEEN THROUGH STUFF.

149
00:06:14,499 --> 00:06:15,918
BACK WHEN MY MOM
WAS ON DRUGS,

150
00:06:16,001 --> 00:06:17,211
I WAS SCARED
ALL THE TIME.

151
00:06:17,294 --> 00:06:18,420
I COULDN'T TRUST ANYONE.

152
00:06:18,504 --> 00:06:20,631
I SAID I'M FINE.

153
00:06:20,714 --> 00:06:21,673
HEY,
THAT'S WHAT I SAID TOO.

154
00:06:21,757 --> 00:06:22,799
OKAY, WELL,
I'M NOT YOU.

155
00:06:22,883 --> 00:06:23,884
(BIG CRASH)

156
00:06:35,938 --> 00:06:37,981
CLARE:
MOM, I'M HOME!

157
00:06:38,982 --> 00:06:39,983
(GASPS)

158
00:06:41,068 --> 00:06:41,985
WHAT'RE YOU DOING HERE?

159
00:06:42,069 --> 00:06:43,820
HELLO TO YOU, TOO.
(LAUGHS)

160
00:06:43,904 --> 00:06:45,948
I THINK
IT'S A FAIR QUESTION.

161
00:06:46,031 --> 00:06:48,325
DAD WANTED ME TO FINISH
WITH THE SINK.

162
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:50,244
WANNA HELP?

163
00:06:50,327 --> 00:06:53,288
I CAN'T.
UM... I'VE GOT PLANS.

164
00:06:53,372 --> 00:06:54,373
WITH MY MOM.

165
00:06:54,456 --> 00:06:55,832
MRS. EDWARDS:
OH. SOUNDS LOVELY,
CLARE-BEAR,

166
00:06:55,916 --> 00:06:58,335
BUT I'M MEETING A FRIEND
FOR DINNER TONIGHT.

167
00:06:58,418 --> 00:07:00,671
WELL, THEN I'LL COME, TOO.
THE MORE, THE MERRIER!

168
00:07:00,754 --> 00:07:03,632
I'M NOT SURE.
YOU SEE IT'S KIND OF A...

169
00:07:03,715 --> 00:07:05,509
CLARE:
A DATE?

170
00:07:05,592 --> 00:07:06,510
NO, NO.

171
00:07:06,593 --> 00:07:09,805
MY FRIEND WANTS TO TALK
ABOUT TROUBLE WITH A SON.

172
00:07:09,888 --> 00:07:13,058
WHY DON'T YOU AND JAKE
ORDER IN A PIZZA?

173
00:07:13,141 --> 00:07:14,643
OKAY? MUAH!

174
00:07:16,603 --> 00:07:17,521
YOU KNOW,
BEFORE THE DIVORCE

175
00:07:17,604 --> 00:07:19,106
MY MOM WOULDN'T LET
A BOY IN THE HOUSE.

176
00:07:19,189 --> 00:07:21,066
NOW SHE'S HAPPY TO LEAVE ME
ALONE WITH ONE.

177
00:07:21,149 --> 00:07:24,695
WELL... WHAT'D SHE THINK
YOU'D DO?

178
00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:27,531
HOMEWORK.

179
00:07:30,242 --> 00:07:32,160
LOTS OF HOMEWORK.

180
00:07:39,793 --> 00:07:41,879
SORRY I'M LATE.

181
00:07:41,962 --> 00:07:43,046
MOVIE NIGHT STUFF.

182
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:45,048
THE TRIALS OF BEING
THE GIRLFRIEND OF A CLASS REP.

183
00:07:45,132 --> 00:07:46,300
LOOK,
ONCE MOVIE NIGHT'S OVER,

184
00:07:46,383 --> 00:07:48,010
YOU'LL HAVE
MY FULL ATTENTION.

185
00:07:48,093 --> 00:07:49,636
OKAY, BUT EVEN THE MOST
DEDICATED POLITICIAN

186
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:50,971
NEEDS TO TAKE A BREAK.

187
00:07:51,054 --> 00:07:52,806
ALL-YOU-CAN-EAT CHOCOLATE
FONDUE TOMORROW NIGHT?

188
00:07:52,890 --> 00:07:54,016
COUPLES ONLY.

189
00:07:54,099 --> 00:07:55,851
UH... TOMORROW?

190
00:07:55,934 --> 00:07:57,186
WHO'S STEALING YOU AWAY
THIS TIME?

191
00:07:57,269 --> 00:07:58,562
UH... ADAM.

192
00:07:58,645 --> 00:08:00,564
WE'RE WORKING
ON THE RADIO SHOW.

193
00:08:00,647 --> 00:08:02,149
BUT I CAN CANCEL FOR YOU.

194
00:08:02,232 --> 00:08:03,400
THE POSSESSIVE GIRLFRIEND?

195
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:05,235
NOT EVERYBODY'S
FAVOURITE CHARACTER.

196
00:08:05,319 --> 00:08:06,904
GO. HAVE FUN.

197
00:08:06,987 --> 00:08:09,948
(LAUGHS)
UH... YOU'RE THE BEST.

198
00:08:15,078 --> 00:08:16,914
CLARE:
ALLI, YOU NEED TO COME OVER.

199
00:08:16,997 --> 00:08:17,915
MY MOM'S OUT

200
00:08:17,998 --> 00:08:19,917
AND ALL I CAN THINK ABOUT
IS KISSING JAKE,

201
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,044
WHO IS IN MY HOUSE,
SWEATING.

202
00:08:23,045 --> 00:08:25,589
SO? YOUR DAD'LL HAVE
ANOTHER BIRTHDAY NEXT YEAR.

203
00:08:25,672 --> 00:08:27,424
JAKE:
CLARE? PIZZA'S HERE.

204
00:08:27,508 --> 00:08:28,425
GOTTA GO.

205
00:08:28,509 --> 00:08:29,635
I-I'M NOT HUNGRY.

206
00:08:29,718 --> 00:08:30,636
UH... JUST DIG IN.

207
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:31,720
(KNOCKING)

208
00:08:33,013 --> 00:08:34,389
EVERYTHING OKAY?

209
00:08:34,473 --> 00:08:36,683
YOU SOUND MORE TENSE
THAN USUAL.

210
00:08:37,684 --> 00:08:39,728
EVERYTHING'S GREAT.

211
00:08:42,022 --> 00:08:45,317
'CAUSE IT SUCKED
WHEN MY PARENTS SPLIT.

212
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:49,780
(EXHALES)

213
00:08:49,863 --> 00:08:50,781
MY FOLKS HAD
THESE OTHER LIVES

214
00:08:50,864 --> 00:08:52,699
THAT I WASN'T A PART OF.

215
00:08:52,783 --> 00:08:56,119
THEY WENT OUT ON DATES,
TOOK CARDIO FIT.

216
00:08:56,203 --> 00:08:58,413
SOMETIMES I FELT
THAT THEY'D FORGOTTEN

217
00:08:58,497 --> 00:09:00,165

I'M NOT THAT HUNGRY.

225
00:09:18,892 --> 00:09:20,310

I'M GOING STRAIGHT TO HELL.

229
00:09:27,901 --> 00:09:29,611
FOR KISSING A CUTE BOY?

230
00:09:29,695 --> 00:09:30,612
I HAVE RULES.

231
00:09:30,696 --> 00:09:32,322
I CAN'T JUST MAKE OUT
WITH EVERY HUNK

232
00:09:32,406 --> 00:09:34,074
WHO BARGES INTO MY LIFE.

233
00:09:34,157 --> 00:09:36,034
DID YOU JUST USE
THE WORD HUNK?

234
00:09:36,118 --> 00:09:37,578
OKAY,
SO NOT THE POINT.

235
00:09:37,661 --> 00:09:39,496
I'D JUST HATE FOR YOU TO MISS
OUT ON A GREAT OPPORTUNITY

236
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:40,747
JUST BECAUSE YOU'RE SCARED.

237
00:09:40,831 --> 00:09:42,833
OF WHAT?
GETTING HURT.

238
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:44,251
I'M NOT.

239
00:09:45,502 --> 00:09:47,129
OKAY,
BUT CAN YOU BLAME ME?

240
00:09:47,212 --> 00:09:49,590
I DON'T HAVE THE BEST
TRACK RECORD WITH GUYS.

241
00:09:49,673 --> 00:09:50,674
CLARE,
YOU'RE AN AWESOME GIRL,

242
00:09:50,757 --> 00:09:52,718
BUT NOT EVERY GUY
IS GOING TO CRASH A CAR

243
00:09:52,801 --> 00:09:54,052
INTO A WALL FOR YOU.

244
00:09:56,346 --> 00:09:59,099
I DID HAVE LOTS OF FUN
LAST NIGHT.

245
00:09:59,183 --> 00:10:00,976
WHAT'S THE WORST
THAT COULD HAPPEN?

246
00:10:01,059 --> 00:10:04,563
WE COULD JUST START SLOW.
NO NEED TO RUSH.

247
00:10:04,646 --> 00:10:05,731
THAT'LL BE TEN DOLLARS.

248
00:10:05,814 --> 00:10:07,566
WAIT, YOU'RE CHARGING ME
FOR ADVICE?

249
00:10:07,649 --> 00:10:09,401
NO, MOVIE NIGHT TICKETS.

250
00:10:09,484 --> 00:10:11,153
MIGHT BE A GOOD IDEA
FOR YOU AND JAKEY BOY

251
00:10:11,236 --> 00:10:13,447
TO SPEND TIME
IN AN UPRIGHT POSITION.

252
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:14,823
HA-HA!

253
00:10:14,907 --> 00:10:15,908
HEY!

254
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:20,245
(EXHALES)

255
00:10:20,329 --> 00:10:22,456
ADAM:
SO, IS IT TRUE?

256
00:10:22,539 --> 00:10:23,457
I DON'T KNOW,

257
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:24,458
I LEFT MY CRYSTAL BALL
AT HOME.

258
00:10:24,541 --> 00:10:25,459
PEOPLE ARE SAYING
YOU WHOOPED KC

259
00:10:25,542 --> 00:10:26,835
DURING INTRAMURALS
YESTERDAY.

260
00:10:26,919 --> 00:10:29,129
IT WAS A MISUNDERSTANDING.
(LOCKER SLAMS)

261
00:10:29,213 --> 00:10:31,632
YOU KNOW, GUY STUFF.

262
00:10:31,715 --> 00:10:33,675
RIGHT... GUY STUFF.

263
00:10:35,344 --> 00:10:37,930
I GOOGLED "SUDDEN RAGE".

264
00:10:38,013 --> 00:10:39,973
IT'S COMMON AFTER TRAUMA
AND...

265
00:10:40,057 --> 00:10:41,433
SO ARE NIGHTMARES.

266
00:10:41,517 --> 00:10:43,018
I HEARD YOU SCREAMING
LAST NIGHT.

267
00:10:45,229 --> 00:10:47,314
YOU MUST'VE BEEN DREAMING.

268
00:10:47,397 --> 00:10:49,983
"PLEASE DON'T KILL ME."

269
00:10:50,067 --> 00:10:51,109
DID MOM HEAR?

270
00:10:51,193 --> 00:10:52,778
DUNNO.
I SWEAR,
IF YOU TELL HER...

271
00:10:52,861 --> 00:10:53,779
MOM WAS RIGHT.

272
00:10:53,862 --> 00:10:55,489
YOU HAVE, LIKE,
POST-TRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER.

273
00:10:55,572 --> 00:10:56,490
YOU NEED HELP.

274
00:10:56,573 --> 00:10:57,491
NO, WHAT I NEED
IS FOR EVERYONE

275
00:10:57,574 --> 00:11:00,160
TO GET OUT OF MY BUSINESS!

276
00:11:00,244 --> 00:11:02,829
NOW, YOU'RE SCARING ME!

277
00:11:02,913 --> 00:11:05,165
PUSHING KC WAS AN ACCIDENT.

278
00:11:05,249 --> 00:11:07,042
I'M GOING TO APOLOGIZE,

279
00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:09,002
THEN I'M GOING
TO MOVE ON.

280
00:11:09,086 --> 00:11:12,214
AND IT WOULD BE A LOT EASIER
IF EVERYONE JUST DID THE SAME.

281
00:11:13,549 --> 00:11:14,550

00:12:04,266 --> 00:12:06,727
TODAY WE TAKE ON THE DELICATE
TOPIC OF FLATULENCE:

294
00:12:06,810 --> 00:12:08,604
WHEN IS IT APPROPRIATE
TO LET ONE GO?

295
00:12:08,687 --> 00:12:10,189
UH, HOW ABOUT NEVER?
(SNIFFS)

296
00:12:10,272 --> 00:12:11,690

HEH. YOU'RE HILARIOUS.

301
00:12:20,991 --> 00:12:21,909
SO WHAT'S THE REAL REASON

302
00:12:21,992 --> 00:12:23,118
YOU'RE LYING

OH, SO NOW YOU GUYS
ARE JUST FRIENDS?

312
00:12:40,844 --> 00:12:41,887

00:13:10,207 --> 00:13:11,458
WHY?
WHAT DID HE SAY?

327
00:13:11,542 --> 00:13:13,293
YOU SAID YOUR FAMILIES
WERE FRIENDS.

328
00:13:13,377 --> 00:13:16,922
OH YEAH, WE USED TO RENT
A COTTAGE NEAR HIS.

329
00:13:17,005 --> 00:13:20,592
IN YOUR OPINION...
IS HE A DECENT GUY?

330
00:13:20,676 --> 00:13:22,386

00:13:27,933 --> 00:13:30,519
I-I HEARD HE'S INVOLVED
WITH SOMEONE.

334
00:13:30,602 --> 00:13:35,065
THEN WHY DID HE AGREE TO GO
TO MOVIE NIGHT WITH ME?

335
00:13:35,148 --> 00:13:36,984

SOMETHING CAME UP.

358

DID I DO SOMETHING
TO PISS YOU OFF?

359
00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:47,846
I JUST THOUGHT THAT...
AFTER WE...

360
00:14:51,475 --> 00:14:53,101
ARE YOU GOING TO MOVIE NIGHT
WITH KATIE?

361
00:14:53,185 --> 00:14:56,396

I SAID YES.

I'M, LIKE, THE OTHER WOMAN?

366
00:15:06,281 --> 00:15:08,659
YOU'RE ANOTHER WOMAN.

367
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:12,871
AFTER MY FOLKS SPLIT,
I GAVE UP RELATIONSHIPS.

00:15:12,955 --> 00:15:14,831
IT'S TOO MUCH HURT.

369
00:15:15,832 --> 00:15:18,460

I THOUGHT YOU'D FEEL THE SAME.

I CAN'T JUST MAKE OUT
WITH YOU.

371
00:15:20,587 --> 00:15:22,089

411
00:17:16,912 --> 00:17:18,497

(CLEARS HER THROAT)

417
00:17:45,858 --> 00:17:49,862
THERE ARE A MILLION
REASONS...

418
00:17:49,945 --> 00:17:52,573
WHY WE SHOULDN'T
BE DOING THIS.

MOM!

425
00:18:22,394 --> 00:18:24,188
CLARE,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING UP?

426
00:18:24,271 --> 00:18:26,231
I THOUGHT SOMEONE
WAS BREAKING IN!

427
00:18:26,315 --> 00:18:27,316
(LAUGHS)

428
00:18:29,902 --> 00:18:33,739
WAIT, IT'S FOUR IN THE MORNING
AND YOU'RE JUST GETTING HOME?

429
00:18:33,822 --> 00:18:35,073
OKAY. (GIGGLES)

430
00:18:36,074 --> 00:18:38,202
I WAS OUT FOR A DRINK
WITH A MAN.

431
00:18:38,285 --> 00:18:39,203
I WOULD'VE TOLD YOU
SOONER,

432
00:18:39,286 --> 00:18:41,955
BUT THE BOOK SAID WAIT
UNTIL IT'S SERIOUS.

433
00:18:42,039 --> 00:18:43,790
WHAT WERE YOU DOING?

434
00:18:43,874 --> 00:18:47,377
CLARE, THAT'S NONE
OF YOUR BUSINESS.

435
00:18:50,631 --> 00:18:52,716
THIS IS A CONFUSING TIME.

436
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:56,720
I WAS MARRIED TO YOUR FATHER
FOR SO LONG.

437
00:18:59,431 --> 00:19:00,641
I SHOULD GET BACK TO BED.

438
00:19:00,724 --> 00:19:01,725
CLARE...

439
00:19:03,977 --> 00:19:06,271
I'M SORRY I WOKE YOU.

440
00:19:08,482 --> 00:19:09,858
GOOD NIGHT.

(LAUGHS)

442
00:19:25,749 --> 00:19:28,669
MY SON IS UP AT NINE
ON A SATURDAY.

443
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:34,091
MUST'VE KNOWN HIS MOM
NEEDED HELP FOLDING LAUNDRY.

444
00:19:38,846 --> 00:19:39,847
WHAT'S UP?

445
00:19:42,432 --> 00:19:46,728
I THINK THERE'S SOMETHING
WRONG WITH ME, MOM.

446
00:19:51,316 --> 00:19:54,820
LISTEN, I HAVE THE NAMES
OF A FEW GOOD THERAPISTS.

447
00:19:54,903 --> 00:19:57,030
I'LL FIND ONE
FOR YOU TO TALK TO...

448
00:19:57,114 --> 00:19:58,031
TODAY EVEN.

449
00:19:58,115 --> 00:19:59,616
THE GANG WILL
STILL BE OUT THERE.

450
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:03,161
HONEY, THE POLICE THINK
IT'S VERY UNLIKELY

451
00:20:03,245 --> 00:20:04,872
THAT THEY'RE GONNA
COME AFTER YOU AGAIN.

452
00:20:04,955 --> 00:20:07,791
BUT DOESN'T MAKE ME
ANY LESS SCARED!

453
00:20:07,875 --> 00:20:08,876
DREW...

454
00:20:11,378 --> 00:20:12,504
WHAT IF I'M GOING CRAZY?

455
00:20:12,588 --> 00:20:15,924
OH, HONEY,
YOU ARE NOT GOING CRAZY.

456
00:20:17,176 --> 00:20:18,594
LOOK AT ME.

457
00:20:19,887 --> 00:20:22,931
LISTEN, I-I THINK
THAT MAYBE WE SHOULD JUST-

458
00:20:23,015 --> 00:20:24,183
MOVE!

459
00:20:24,266 --> 00:20:25,267
NO.

460
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:29,855
WE JUST NEED TO GET YOU AWAY
FROM ALL THIS TERRIBLE STUFF,

461
00:20:29,938 --> 00:20:30,898
JUST FOR A LITTLE WHILE.

462
00:20:30,981 --> 00:20:31,732
BUT MOM...

463
00:20:31,815 --> 00:20:34,234
HONEY, LISTEN,
YOUR DAD AND I HAVE JOBS.

464
00:20:34,318 --> 00:20:38,280
IT'S NOT LIKE WE CAN
JUST PICK UP AND GO.

465
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:43,368
HEY...

466
00:20:44,953 --> 00:20:46,330
HEY...

467
00:20:49,166 --> 00:20:50,459
CLARE:
THANKS FOR COMING.

468
00:20:50,542 --> 00:20:51,919
I TRIED TALKING TO ALLI,

469
00:20:52,002 --> 00:20:54,796
BUT SHE DIDN'T REALLY
UNDERSTAND.

470
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:55,881
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU CAUGHT YOUR MOM

471
00:20:55,964 --> 00:20:57,466
SNEAKING IN AT 4 AM.

472
00:20:57,549 --> 00:20:59,092
AND THEN SHE BASICALLY COPPED
TO A BOOTY CALL

473
00:20:59,176 --> 00:21:00,177
WITH A STRANGER.

474
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:01,220
A STRANGER?

475
00:21:01,303 --> 00:21:02,804
WELL, STRANGE TO ME.

476
00:21:02,888 --> 00:21:04,598
SHE SPENT SIXTEEN YEARS
LECTURING ME

477
00:21:04,681 --> 00:21:06,099
ON CHRISTIAN VALUES,

478
00:21:06,183 --> 00:21:09,645
AND THEN JUMPS IN BED
WITH THE FIRST MAN SHE MEETS.

479
00:21:10,646 --> 00:21:15,150
WHEN MY DAD STARTED DATING,
I FELT THE SAME WAY.

480
00:21:16,193 --> 00:21:20,113
THEN I REALIZED
IT'S WHAT MADE HIM HAPPY.

481
00:21:20,656 --> 00:21:24,660
SO... WE SHOULD JUST DO
WHAT MAKES US HAPPY?

482
00:21:25,953 --> 00:21:29,498
IF IT DOESN'T HURT ANYONE,
WHY NOT?

483
00:21:29,581 --> 00:21:31,583
THIS CASUAL THING...

484
00:21:34,002 --> 00:21:35,504
HOW DOES IT WORK EXACTLY?

485
00:21:35,587 --> 00:21:38,006
WE HANG OUT,
WE HAVE FUN.

486
00:21:39,132 --> 00:21:41,385
THEN NO ONE GETS HURT.

487
00:21:43,804 --> 00:21:45,180
I DON'T WANT TO FORCE YOU.

488
00:21:45,264 --> 00:21:46,765
OH, SHUT UP.
