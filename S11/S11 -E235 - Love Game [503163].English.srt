JUST LIKE THAT.

533
00:20:12,754 --> 00:20:14,506
DID YOU TAKE A PHOTO
TO SHOW ELI?

534
00:20:14,590 --> 00:20:15,883
FUNNY.

535
00:20:15,966 --> 00:20:17,509
BEFORE LAST NIGHT,
I COULDN'T SEE MYSELF

536
00:20:17,593 --> 00:20:19,428
KISSING ANYONE BUT ELI
EVER AGAIN.

537
00:20:19,511 --> 00:20:21,305
BUT NOW?

538
00:20:21,388 --> 00:20:22,347
I'M FREE.

539
00:20:22,431 --> 00:20:23,724
SO, WAS THE KISS GOOD?

540
00:20:23,807 --> 00:20:26,226
OH, YEAH.
CLARE EDWARDS,
YOU LITTLE HUSSY!

541
00:20:26,310 --> 00:20:27,853
SO WHAT, ARE YOU TWO
LIKE AN ITEM NOW?

542
00:20:27,936 --> 00:20:29,688
"AN ITEM"?
WHO ARE YOU, MY MOTHER?

543
00:20:29,771 --> 00:20:31,815
NO, IT WAS...
IT WAS JUST FUN.

544
00:20:31,899 --> 00:20:33,483
THAT'S ALL I WANT
RIGHT NOW.

545
00:20:33,567 --> 00:20:35,277
HMM...
THAT'S WHAT THEY ALL SAY.

547
00:20:40,115 --> 00:20:41,658
GIVE ME A SECOND?

548
00:20:41,742 --> 00:20:43,911
ARE YOU GONNA RUB
ELI'S NOSE IN IT?

549
00:20:43,994 --> 00:20:45,037
OH, YOU DO HAVE PHOTOS!

550
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:46,163
NO, ALLI!

551
00:20:47,164 --> 00:20:49,458
I OWE HIM AN APOLOGY.

CLARE:
I KNOW YOU PROBABLY
DON'T WANNA SEE ME RIGHT NOW,

555
00:20:58,842 --> 00:21:00,886
SO I'LL KEEP IT SHORT.

556
00:21:00,969 --> 00:21:04,056
I AM SO SORRY
ABOUT LAST NIGHT.

557
00:21:05,933 --> 00:21:08,352
ONCE UPON A TIME...

558
00:21:08,435 --> 00:21:11,813
WE HAD SOMETHING
REALLY GREAT,

559
00:21:11,897 --> 00:21:15,108
AND MAYBE ONE DAY
WE CAN BE FRIENDS.

560
00:21:15,192 --> 00:21:17,736
BUT I KNOW YOU DON'T HAVE
FEELINGS FOR ME ANYMORE,

561
00:21:17,819 --> 00:21:20,531
SO I'LL LEAVE YOU ALONE.

562
00:21:20,614 --> 00:21:23,075
I DON'T HAVE FEELINGS AT ALL.

563
00:21:23,158 --> 00:21:24,660
WHAT?
I'M ON MEDS.
