1
00:00:02,169 --> 00:00:04,129
DREW:
CLASS IS OVER.
EXAMS ARE DONE.

2
00:00:04,213 --> 00:00:06,423
I SHOULD BE AT HOME,
SLEEPING UNTIL NOON.

3
00:00:06,507 --> 00:00:09,635
COME ON, FUTURE GRADE NINE
ORIENTATION DAY'S GONNA BE FUN!

4
00:00:09,718 --> 00:00:12,387
YEAH, VOLUNTEERING TO SHOW
NEWBIES HOW TO FIND WOOD SHOP?

5
00:00:12,471 --> 00:00:15,432
NAH, THE NEW STUDENT COUNCIL
PRESIDENT OWES ME BIG TIME.

6
00:00:15,516 --> 00:00:16,475
SHE SURE IS AN UPGRADE ON-

7
00:00:16,558 --> 00:00:17,476
BIANCA.

8
00:00:17,559 --> 00:00:19,895
UGH, EVEN HEARING HER NAME
MAKES ME WANT TO HURL.

9
00:00:19,978 --> 00:00:21,480
THE FURTHER WE ALL STAY AWAY
FROM HER, THE BETTER.

10
00:00:21,563 --> 00:00:22,773
DREW:
UH, THAT MIGHT BE TOUGH.

11
00:00:22,856 --> 00:00:26,109
I SAW HER NAME ON THE NINER-DAY
SIGN-UP SHEET.

12
00:00:26,193 --> 00:00:27,778
YOU'RE NOT GONNA
TALK TO HER.

13
00:00:27,861 --> 00:00:29,780
(EXHALE) WELL...

14
00:00:29,863 --> 00:00:33,158
OKAY, A GANG BEAT YOU UP
BECAUSE OF HER...

15
00:00:33,242 --> 00:00:35,285
AND THAT GUY, VINCE,
STILL HAS A HIT OUT ON YOU

16
00:00:35,369 --> 00:00:36,286
BECAUSE OF HER.

17
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:37,454
THAT'S ALL BEHIND ME.

18
00:00:37,538 --> 00:00:39,957
I'VE GOT A SMART, AMAZING,
A-LIST GIRL NOW.

19
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:40,958
BIANCA.

20
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:43,961
NO, KATIE. ADAM, PLEASE
JUST TRY AND KEEP UP.

21
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:45,003
NO... BIANCA.

22
00:00:48,757 --> 00:00:51,218
DREW:
NO... THAT CAN'T BE HER.

23
00:00:51,301 --> 00:00:55,138
ADAM:
IT'S HER, STANDING BY A CAR,
TALKING TO SOME DUDE.

24
00:00:57,432 --> 00:00:59,643
ADAM,
THAT DUDE IS VINCE.

KATIE:
THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR COMING!

41
00:01:47,024 --> 00:01:49,610
LET'S MAKE NEXT YEAR'S NEW
PANTHERS FEEL TOTALLY WELCOME.

42
00:01:56,992 --> 00:01:58,535
HEY... I NEED A FAVOUR.

43
00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:00,954
ANYTHING FOR MY PROM DATE.

44
00:02:01,038 --> 00:02:03,040
CAN YOU PAIR ME
WITH BIANCA?

45
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:04,416
KATIE:
YOUR EX?! WHY?

46
00:02:04,499 --> 00:02:05,876
I THOUGHT YOU HATED HER.

47
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:07,127
DREW:
I THINK SHE'S UP
TO SOMETHING.

48
00:02:07,211 --> 00:02:08,712
SOUNDS A LITTLE PARANOID.

49
00:02:08,795 --> 00:02:10,631
WHY ELSE WOULD
SHE BE HERE?

50
00:02:10,714 --> 00:02:11,965
COME ON,
YOU'VE GOTTA TRUST ME.

51
00:02:12,049 --> 00:02:15,636
PLEASE? TONIGHT AT PROM?
I'M ALL YOURS.

52
00:02:15,719 --> 00:02:16,803
YOU'LL FAST DANCE?
YES.

53
00:02:16,887 --> 00:02:17,971
YOU'LL SLOW DANCE?
YES.

54
00:02:18,055 --> 00:02:19,223
CELINE DION
"MY HEART WILL GO ON"?

55
00:02:19,306 --> 00:02:20,599
ANYTHING!

56
00:02:20,682 --> 00:02:23,477
I JUST GOTTA GET TO
THE BOTTOM OF THIS, OKAY?

57
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:26,146
(KISS)

58
00:02:38,784 --> 00:02:40,869
SO ARE YOU GONNA SHOW ME
YOUR PROM OUTFIT OR NOT?

59
00:02:40,953 --> 00:02:43,205
JAKE:
HEY, YOU'RE LUCKY
YOU EVEN GET TO GO.

60
00:02:43,288 --> 00:02:45,457
IF I WASN'T IN GRADE ELEVEN,
YOU'D BE STUCK WAITING TABLES.

61
00:02:45,541 --> 00:02:48,043
WHICH IS WHAT MY MOM THINKS
I'M DOING, IN CASE SHE ASKS.

62
00:02:48,126 --> 00:02:50,838
JAKE:
OKAY, BE HONEST...

63
00:02:50,921 --> 00:02:53,048
DO YOU LIKE THE TIE?

64
00:02:53,131 --> 00:02:54,299
(LAUGHS)

65
00:02:56,301 --> 00:02:58,095
MY MOM IS GONNA BE BACK
ANY MINUTE!

66
00:02:58,178 --> 00:02:59,930
COME ON,
WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL?

67
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:01,932
STATUS UPDATE:
OUR PARENTS ARE STILL DATING.

68
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:04,476
WHICH MEANS THEY WON'T BE HAPPY
WHEN THEY FIND OUT WE ARE.

69
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:05,811
CAN'T WE LIVE
DANGEROUSLY?

70
00:03:05,894 --> 00:03:08,605
NO! AFTER TONIGHT,
EVERYTHING IS DANGEROUS.

71
00:03:08,689 --> 00:03:10,566
WITH SCHOOL OVER
AND THE RENO DONE,

72
00:03:10,649 --> 00:03:12,818
THEY'RE GONNA BE SUSPICIOUS
EVERY TIME WE HANG OUT!

73
00:03:12,901 --> 00:03:15,445
DON'T WORRY. MY DAD DOESN'T
DO THE LONG-TERM THING.

74
00:03:15,529 --> 00:03:17,865
THEY'LL BREAK UP AND WE'LL BE
FREE TO DO WHATEVER WE WANT!

75
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:24,204
MRS. EDWARDS:
OH... JAKE?
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

76
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:25,789
JAKE:
UH... THE RENO!

77
00:03:25,873 --> 00:03:28,125
MY DAD WANTED ME TO DO ONE
LAST WATER PRESSURE CHECK ON-

78
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:30,252
MRS. EDWARDS:
DOESN'T REALLY MATTER.
I'M GLAD I'VE GOT YOU BOTH.

79
00:03:30,335 --> 00:03:33,297
CLARE, WHAT TIME DOES PROM
VOLUNTEERING START, TONIGHT?

80
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:34,923
WHY?

81
00:03:35,007 --> 00:03:37,634
MRS. EDWARDS:
GLENN AND I JUST THOUGHT WE
COULD ALL HAVE DINNER TOGETHER.

82
00:03:37,718 --> 00:03:38,969
THAT WORK?

83
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:40,137
THAT'S PERFECT.

84
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:42,764
MRS. EDWARDS:
GREAT. CAN'T WAIT.

85
00:03:44,808 --> 00:03:45,809
THAT'S A DISASTER.

86
00:03:45,893 --> 00:03:47,060
WHY?
WE STILL GET GO TO PROM.

87
00:03:47,144 --> 00:03:48,645
AND SHE DIDN'T SUSPECT
A THING.

88
00:03:48,729 --> 00:03:50,564
WE'LL MISS PRE-PROM PICTURES
WITH OUR FRIENDS.

89
00:03:50,647 --> 00:03:52,399
IT'S OUR LAST CHANCE TO GO OUT
WITH A GOOD EXCUSE

90
00:03:52,482 --> 00:03:54,484
AND OUR PARENTS
ARE GOING TO RUIN IT!

91
00:03:54,568 --> 00:03:55,777
THEN WE WON'T LET THEM.

92
00:03:55,861 --> 00:03:57,487
I'LL TALK MY DAD
INTO LETTING US RESCHEDULE.

93
00:03:57,571 --> 00:03:58,405
YOU THINK
HE'D GO FOR THAT?

94
00:03:58,488 --> 00:03:59,406
WELL, HE BETTER.

95
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:02,075
OTHERWISE,
I WON'T GET TO WEAR MY TIE!

96
00:04:04,578 --> 00:04:05,204
KATIE:
ALL RIGHT, NEW NINERS?

97
00:04:05,287 --> 00:04:07,372
WHO'S READY TO PARTY,
DEGRASSI-STYLE?

98
00:04:07,456 --> 00:04:09,166
NINERS:
(CHEERING, APPLAUSE)

99
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:10,542
KATIE:
WELCOME TO GRADE NINE
ORIENTATION.

100
00:04:10,626 --> 00:04:11,543
MY NAME IS KATIE MATLIN

101
00:04:11,627 --> 00:04:14,338
AND I'LL BE YOUR STUDENT
COUNCIL PRESIDENT NEXT YEAR.

102
00:04:14,421 --> 00:04:15,631
MO:
SCHOOL'S OUT FOR SUMMER!

103
00:04:15,714 --> 00:04:16,840
SCHOOL'S OUT FOREVER,
DUDE.

104
00:04:16,924 --> 00:04:17,841
YOU GET THAT PROM
PLAYLIST?

105
00:04:17,925 --> 00:04:18,759
YEAH. THANKS, MAN.

106
00:04:18,842 --> 00:04:20,219
I THINK YOU'LL FIND THERE'S
A STRING OF SAD SONGS

107
00:04:20,302 --> 00:04:23,388
THAT'LL MAKE THE LONELY GIRLS
FEEL EXTRA LONELY!

108
00:04:23,472 --> 00:04:25,557
YOU KNOW, MAYBE SOMEONE'LL NEED
A SHOULDER TO CRY ON?

109
00:04:25,641 --> 00:04:26,808
THEN YOU SWOOP IN...

110
00:04:26,892 --> 00:04:28,185
THANKS, MAN.
BUT I'M OKAY.

111
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:31,021
YOU ALREADY FOUND
ANOTHER DATE?

112
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:33,106
REMEMBER WHEN I SAID THAT
THERE'S NOTHING GOING ON

113
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:34,233
WITH ME AND MS. OH?

114
00:04:34,316 --> 00:04:35,901
NO WAY...

115
00:04:35,984 --> 00:04:38,111
SHE GAVE ME HER PHONE NUMBER
FOR WHEN SCHOOL'S OVER.

116
00:04:38,195 --> 00:04:39,446
AND NOW SCHOOL'S OVER!

117
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:41,406
YEAH, SO I THOUGHT TONIGHT
WOULD BE THE PERFECT NIGHT

118
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:42,449
FOR OUR FIRST DATE.

119
00:04:42,533 --> 00:04:45,619
YOU LUCKY BASTARD.
SAV FOR THE WIN!

120
00:04:45,702 --> 00:04:46,870
WHOO!

121
00:04:46,954 --> 00:04:49,289
KATIE:
NOW, EVERYONE TO YOUR
STATIONS AND HAVE FUN!

122
00:04:49,373 --> 00:04:51,458
CROWD:
(CHEERS) WHOO! YA!

123
00:04:55,003 --> 00:04:57,339
HEY,
CAN WE TALK FOR A SEC?

124
00:04:57,422 --> 00:05:00,342
I THOUGHT WE WEREN'T
TALKING AT ALL.

125
00:05:00,425 --> 00:05:02,177
THIS IS US.
WE SHOULD START.

126
00:05:04,221 --> 00:05:06,473
DREW:
I SAW YOU WITH VINCE.

127
00:05:07,641 --> 00:05:09,893
SO? WHY DO YOU CARE
WHAT I DO?

128
00:05:09,977 --> 00:05:10,894
YOU KNOW I HAVE THAT
RESTRAINING ORDER

129
00:05:10,978 --> 00:05:12,771
AGAINST HIM, RIGHT?

130
00:05:12,855 --> 00:05:13,605
WHAT WERE YOU TWO
TALKING ABOUT?

131
00:05:13,689 --> 00:05:15,649
IT'S REALLY NONE
OF YOUR BUSINESS, DREW.

132
00:05:15,732 --> 00:05:18,485
HEY BICKERSONS,
WHY CAN'T I GET ONTO YOUTUBE?

133
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:21,572
JUST DROP IT, OKAY?

134
00:05:21,655 --> 00:05:24,032
FINE.
CONSIDER IT DROPPED.

135
00:05:24,116 --> 00:05:25,242
THE FUTURE NINERS
AWAIT US.

136
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:27,661
I'M HERE FOR ORIENTATION,
AND I HAVE YET-

137
00:05:27,744 --> 00:05:30,122
BIANCA:
HEY, BIG RED!
JUST 'CAUSE YOU'RE NEW HERE,

138
00:05:30,205 --> 00:05:32,666
DOESN'T MEAN THAT I WON'T
STUFF YOU INTO A LOCKER.

139
00:05:32,749 --> 00:05:34,209
BUT IF YOU PAY ATTENTION,
I CAN TEACH YOU

140
00:05:34,293 --> 00:05:35,294
HOW TO AVOID THAT FATE.

141
00:05:35,377 --> 00:05:38,672
THAT GOES FOR ALL OF YOU.
CAPICHE?

142
00:05:39,673 --> 00:05:41,675
OKAY... AND THIS
IS THE RESOURCE CENTRE.

143
00:05:41,758 --> 00:05:43,719
A FANCY NAME
FOR THE "COMPUTER ROOM"...

144
00:05:43,802 --> 00:05:44,553
IF YOU'RE A KEENER,

145
00:05:44,636 --> 00:05:46,597
YOU'LL PROBABLY SPEND MOST
OF YOUR SPARE TIME HERE,

146
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:47,973
GETTING YOUR HOMEWORK DONE.

147
00:05:48,056 --> 00:05:51,018
IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR SOMEWHERE
TO SOCIALIZE, THIS ISN'T IT...

148
00:05:51,101 --> 00:05:53,312
THAT GOES FOR SOCIAL
NETWORKING, TOO.

149
00:05:53,395 --> 00:05:54,938
AS YOUR FRIEND BIG RED
HERE DISCOVERED,

150
00:05:55,022 --> 00:05:57,858
SOCIAL NETWORKING SITES
ARE BLOCKED...

151
00:06:04,239 --> 00:06:05,532
HI.

152
00:06:07,534 --> 00:06:09,286
I KNOW WE SHOULDN'T BE SEEN
TOGETHER AT SCHOOL, BUT UM...

153
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:15,000
I GOT TO INSPECT
THIS OBOE!

154
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:16,251
(LAUGHS)

155
00:06:20,756 --> 00:06:22,841
SO... I'M NOT
YOUR STUDENT ANYMORE.

156
00:06:22,925 --> 00:06:24,426
NOPE.
WE'RE A COUPLE OF ADULTS...

157
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:26,136
...WHO SHOULD GO
ON A DATE TONIGHT.

158
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:27,262
WHAT ABOUT PROM?

159
00:06:27,346 --> 00:06:28,472
I'LL SKIP IT.

160
00:06:28,555 --> 00:06:30,224
BUT I HAVE TO CHAPERONE.
TOMORROW?

161
00:06:32,726 --> 00:06:35,437
I GOTTA DRIVE ALLI TO OTTAWA
FOR THAT SCIENCE THINGY.

162
00:06:35,521 --> 00:06:37,064
THE NEXT NIGHT?

163
00:06:37,147 --> 00:06:40,275
I'M AWAY GETTING MY MUSIC
ACCREDITATION FOR SIX WEEKS.

164
00:06:40,359 --> 00:06:41,693
SERIOUSLY?

165
00:06:45,739 --> 00:06:46,573
BUT AFTER THAT,
I LEAVE FOR UNI-!

166
00:06:46,657 --> 00:06:47,658
OH!

167
00:06:49,701 --> 00:06:50,953
-VERSITY.

168
00:07:04,383 --> 00:07:07,511
MAYBE SOME THINGS
ARE BETTER LEFT UNFINISHED.

169
00:07:07,594 --> 00:07:09,263
YEAH. MAYBE...

170
00:07:10,597 --> 00:07:12,432
THE OBOE'S FINE,
BY THE WAY.

171
00:07:20,941 --> 00:07:22,150
SHE'S DATING VINCE!

172
00:07:22,234 --> 00:07:24,403
THE GUY WHO WANTS TO KILL ME
IS HER BOYFRIEND.

173
00:07:24,486 --> 00:07:26,488
VINCE?
ARE YOU'RE SURE?

174
00:07:26,572 --> 00:07:28,365
DREW:
"SWEETIE," "HUN," "BOO!"

175
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:29,825
THEY'RE ALL THERE IN THEIR
TEXTS TO EACH OTHER.

176
00:07:29,908 --> 00:07:31,285
SHE'S MESSING WITH ME,
ADAM!

177
00:07:31,368 --> 00:07:32,619
WHY ELSE WOULD
SHE EVEN BE HERE?

178
00:07:32,703 --> 00:07:35,163
DREW JUST CHILL OUT!
OKAY?

179
00:07:35,247 --> 00:07:36,874
YOU'VE GOT A GREAT
NEW GIRLFRIEND.

180
00:07:36,957 --> 00:07:39,459
SUMMER AHEAD OF YOU.
PROM TONIGHT JUST...

181
00:07:39,543 --> 00:07:41,003
GET THROUGH TODAY
AND YOU'RE FREE.

182
00:07:41,086 --> 00:07:44,339
FREE OF THE NIGHTMARES?
THE PTSD?

183
00:07:45,966 --> 00:07:48,051
I CAN'T LIVE IN FEAR
ANYMORE, ADAM.

184
00:07:48,135 --> 00:07:49,094
WELL, WHAT IF YOU
CONFRONT HER,

185
00:07:49,178 --> 00:07:51,013
SHE GETS PISSED OFF
AND TELLS HIM?

186
00:07:51,096 --> 00:07:55,392
WHAT IF THAT MAKES HIM
COME BACK FOR YOU?

187
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:58,395
I'VE BEEN TRAINING
ALL SEMESTER FOR THIS.

188
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:00,522
I'LL BE READY.

189
00:08:00,606 --> 00:08:02,691
THOUGHT YOU WERE DONE
WITH THE FIGHTING.

190
00:08:02,774 --> 00:08:04,943

191
00:08:08,363 --> 00:08:10,199
GLENN:

ON THE CHAPMAN JOB

192
00:08:10,282 --> 00:08:11,783

SO, FAMILY DINNER TONIGHT?

195
00:08:18,832 --> 00:08:23,170
GLENN:
YEAH, HELEN THOUGHT
IT'D BE A GOOD IDEA.

196
00:08:23,253 --> 00:08:24,755
WHAT?
YOU DON'T LIKE HER?

197
00:08:24,838 --> 00:08:27,341
OH... SHE'S, WHO MRS. EDWARDS?
SHE'S NICE...

198
00:08:27,424 --> 00:08:28,759
OH, THAT'S GOOD...

199
00:08:28,842 --> 00:08:30,260
SO WHAT?
YOU HATE DINNER, THEN?

200
00:08:30,344 --> 00:08:32,721
(LAUGHS) NO, NAW,

201
00:08:34,223 --> 00:08:36,517
TONIGHT'S PROM.

202
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,185
(LAUGHS) PROM?

203
00:08:39,186 --> 00:08:41,396
I DIDN'T THINK YOU WERE
INTO ALL THAT STUFF.

204
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:43,398
UH, IT MUST BE A GIRL.

205
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:46,693
(LAUGH)
HEY, ATTABOY.

206
00:08:47,986 --> 00:08:49,613
WELL, I'LL TELL YOU WHAT,
WE'LL SPEED UP THE CHICKEN

207
00:08:49,696 --> 00:08:50,864
AND WE'LL SKIP
THE KEY LIME PIE.

208
00:08:50,948 --> 00:08:52,741
WE'LL GET YOU THERE
ON TIME, OKAY?

209
00:08:52,824 --> 00:08:55,827
YEAH, BUT WE NEED TIME TO GET
READY AND TAKE PICTURES-

210
00:08:55,911 --> 00:08:57,329
THIS IS IMPORTANT, JAKE.

211
00:08:57,412 --> 00:09:00,374
WHOA.
WHAT'S THE BIG SECRET?

212
00:09:00,457 --> 00:09:02,709
WE'RE GETTING MARRIED.

213
00:09:06,421 --> 00:09:08,257
WHAT, THAT'S IT.
NO OPINION?

214
00:09:10,717 --> 00:09:13,178
IT'D MEAN A LOT TO ME
TO HAVE YOUR APPROVAL, JAKE.

215
00:09:13,262 --> 00:09:15,556
IF YOU'RE HAPPY, DAD...

216
00:09:17,933 --> 00:09:19,726
THEN, I'M HAPPY.

217
00:09:20,769 --> 00:09:22,271
THANKS, SON.

218
00:09:22,354 --> 00:09:23,981
AND DON'T LET IT SLIP
TO CLARE, OKAY?

219
00:09:24,064 --> 00:09:25,065
HM...

220
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:27,776

224
00:09:40,747 --> 00:09:42,374
WAIT.

225
00:09:42,457 --> 00:09:44,960
WHAT, I DON'T GET PIZZA?

226
00:09:48,547 --> 00:09:49,965
I KNOW YOU'RE DATING
VINCE.

227
00:09:50,048 --> 00:09:51,842
LET ME OUT.

228
00:09:51,925 --> 00:09:54,261
IS IT TO GET BACK
AT ME?

229
00:09:54,344 --> 00:09:55,429
WHAT?

230
00:09:55,512 --> 00:09:57,681
ARE YOU SPYING ON ME
FOR HIM? IS THAT IT?

231
00:09:57,764 --> 00:09:58,724
CAN YOU JUST TELL ME!

232
00:09:58,807 --> 00:10:01,393
I'M DOING THIS
TO SAVE YOUR LIFE!

233
00:10:01,476 --> 00:10:02,394
WHAT?!

234
00:10:02,477 --> 00:10:03,604
HE CAME BACK AND SAID
HE'D FINISH YOU OFF

235
00:10:03,687 --> 00:10:05,022
UNLESS I DID STUFF
FOR HIM.

236
00:10:05,105 --> 00:10:05,814
LIKE WHAT?

237
00:10:05,898 --> 00:10:08,567
SELL DRUGS.
PLAY THE DUTIFUL GIRLFRIEND.

238
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:09,735
YOU GET THE PICTURE?

239
00:10:09,818 --> 00:10:10,819
LIKE YOU WOULD DO
THAT FOR ME.

240
00:10:10,903 --> 00:10:13,363
YOU TOOK THE HEAT
ON ANSON FOR ME.

241
00:10:13,447 --> 00:10:16,408
YOU KEPT ME OUT
OF JUVIE AND...

242
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:23,916
YOU'RE THE ONE GOOD THING
I'VE EVER HAD IN MY LIFE.

243
00:10:23,999 --> 00:10:26,001
AND I COULDN'T LIVE WITH MYSELF
IF YOU GOT HURT AGAIN.

244
00:10:31,131 --> 00:10:32,382
YOU CAN'T KEEP DOING IT.

245
00:10:32,466 --> 00:10:33,967
IT'S WHY I'M HERE.

246
00:10:34,051 --> 00:10:36,720
ANYTHING TO GET AWAY
FROM HIM FOR A FEW HOURS.

247
00:10:36,803 --> 00:10:39,223
VINCE HAS THAT KIND
OF HOLD ON YOU?

248
00:10:47,105 --> 00:10:49,566
BIANCA, WE CAN'T LET HIM
GET AWAY WITH THIS!

249
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:53,362
PROMISE ME
YOU WON'T TRY ANYTHING.

250
00:10:53,445 --> 00:10:54,655
PLEASE, DREW...

251
00:10:55,656 --> 00:10:57,491
YOU CAN'T FIGHT
THIS BATTLE.

252
00:11:06,542 --> 00:11:08,502
(PUNCHING THUDS,
EFFORT GRUNTS)

253
00:11:15,968 --> 00:11:16,969
(PANTING)

254
00:11:19,805 --> 00:11:21,765
KATIE:
HEY, CHAMP.

255
00:11:21,849 --> 00:11:23,267
WE'RE ABOUT TO START
THE AFTERNOON SESSION

256
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:25,227
AND HERE YOU'RE IN HERE
PUMMELING THAT BAG.

257
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:27,145
EVERYTHING OKAY?

258
00:11:27,229 --> 00:11:28,772
I'M FINE.

259
00:11:28,856 --> 00:11:31,859
DID YOU TALK TO BIANCA?
IS SHE UP TO SOMETHING?

260
00:11:31,942 --> 00:11:34,528
NO. BUT SHE SORTA
NEEDS A FAVOUR.

261
00:11:36,363 --> 00:11:38,198
AND I DON'T KNOW
IF I SHOULD HELP HER.

262
00:11:38,282 --> 00:11:39,533
A FAVOUR FOR YOUR EX?

263
00:11:39,616 --> 00:11:41,952
I KIND OF OWE HER ONE.

264
00:11:43,203 --> 00:11:46,790
SHE'S BEING HARRASSED
BY THIS GUY.

265
00:11:46,874 --> 00:11:49,418
YOU'VE GOT THAT LOOK
IN YOUR EYE AGAIN.

266
00:11:49,501 --> 00:11:50,711
THAT FEAR.

267
00:11:50,794 --> 00:11:52,045
WE'VE BEEN OVER THIS
IN TAE KWON DO...

268
00:11:52,129 --> 00:11:54,715
WHAT'S THE LAST TENET?

269
00:11:54,798 --> 00:11:57,467
"I SHALL BUILD A BETTER
AND MORE PEACEFUL WORLD."

270
00:11:57,551 --> 00:11:58,802
EXACTLY,
THE POWER TO STRIKE,

271
00:11:58,886 --> 00:12:01,221
BUT THE DISCIPLINE
TO NEVER HAVE TO.

272
00:12:01,305 --> 00:12:02,306
YOU DON'T WANT ME
TO HELP HER.

273
00:12:02,389 --> 00:12:04,308
THERE ARE OTHER WAYS.

274
00:12:04,391 --> 00:12:09,479
EVERY JOURNALIST KNOWS WORDS
ARE MORE POWERFUL THAN FISTS.

275
00:12:09,563 --> 00:12:10,564
PLEASE...

276
00:12:11,565 --> 00:12:13,984
NO BLACK EYES FOR PROM.

277
00:12:17,571 --> 00:12:19,114
AND WIPE YOURSELF DOWN.

278
00:12:19,198 --> 00:12:20,407
WE CAN'T HAVE SOME
BIG SWEATY DUDE

279
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:22,576
SCARING OFF ALL THE NINERS.

280
00:12:37,132 --> 00:12:38,258

281
00:12:39,259 --> 00:12:40,260
ANYA:
HI!

282
00:12:40,511 --> 00:12:41,720
HEY...

283
00:12:41,803 --> 00:12:43,680

PROM SEATING CHART?

286
00:12:47,601 --> 00:12:49,811
YOU GUYS CAME HERE
TO ASK ME FOR PROM HELP?

287
00:12:49,895 --> 00:12:52,523
NO. OF COURSE NOT.
WE CAME TO SEE YOU.

288
00:12:52,606 --> 00:12:53,565
HOW'D THE SURGERY GO?

289
00:12:53,649 --> 00:12:55,859
UH, WELL... WE'RE STILL WAITING
TO MAKE SURE MY BODY

290
00:12:55,943 --> 00:12:59,655
DOESN'T REJECT THE KIDNEY,
BUT SO FAR SO GOOD,

291
00:12:59,738 --> 00:13:02,658
AND THE DOCTORS SAID
THE PROCEDURE WAS FLAWLESS!

292
00:13:02,741 --> 00:13:04,284
AS WITH EVERYTHING
YOU DO!

293
00:13:04,368 --> 00:13:05,536
((CHUCKLES)

294
00:13:05,619 --> 00:13:07,037
SO... UM...

295
00:13:09,289 --> 00:13:10,999
OKAY, WHAT PROM HELP
DO YOU NEED?

296
00:13:11,083 --> 00:13:12,376
SORRY. YOU JUST SEEM
TO BE THE ONLY ONE

297
00:13:12,459 --> 00:13:13,710
WHO KNOWS HOW
TO DO THIS STUFF.

298
00:13:13,794 --> 00:13:15,879
I HAVE ONE NAME LEFT,
HEATHER POULETTE,

299
00:13:15,963 --> 00:13:18,382
AND ALL THE SENIOR TABLES

300
00:13:18,465 --> 00:13:19,466
HOLLY J:
AH...

301
00:13:20,801 --> 00:13:23,345
HM... YOU CAN PUT HEATHER
WITH THE SWIM CLUB GIRLS

302
00:13:23,428 --> 00:13:24,972
AND MOVE ZANE TO OUR TABLE.

303
00:13:25,055 --> 00:13:26,098
BUT RILEY WOULD
HATE THAT.

304
00:13:26,181 --> 00:13:29,184
FINE, BUT THEY'RE SERVING
ONIONS WITH DINNER.

305
00:13:29,268 --> 00:13:30,978
AND HEATHER POULETTE'S
BREATH...

306
00:13:31,061 --> 00:13:32,604
ALL RIGHT,
RILEY CAN SUCK IT UP.

307
00:13:32,688 --> 00:13:36,275
HE'S GOTTA HAVE TO
TALK TO ZANE SOMETIME, RIGHT?

308
00:13:36,358 --> 00:13:37,860
SAV?

309
00:13:37,943 --> 00:13:41,738
UM, ARE THERE ANY
PRIVATE CORNERS...

310
00:13:41,822 --> 00:13:43,240
OR ADJACENT ROOMS...

00:13:43,323 --> 00:13:46,743
OR LOCKABLE CLOSETS
AT THE PROM VENUE?

312
00:13:46,827 --> 00:13:50,330
SIMPSON BARELY LET US HAVE THE
PROM OFF-CAMPUS, REMEMBER?

313
00:13:50,414 --> 00:13:52,374
SECRET ROOMS,
EQUAL SECRET TROUBLE.

314
00:13:53,876 --> 00:13:55,043
WHY?

315
00:13:55,127 --> 00:13:56,545
NO, I WAS JUST WONDERING...

316
00:13:56,628 --> 00:13:58,463
YOU KNOW, HEAVEN FORBID
A STUDENT TRIES TO SNEAK OFF

317
00:13:58,547 --> 00:14:00,048
TO MAKE OUT.

318
00:14:02,342 --> 00:14:04,303
SAV, YOU'RE SO WEIRD
SOMETIMES.

NITROCELLULOSE.
ALSO KNOWN AS FLASH PAPER.

325
00:14:21,153 --> 00:14:22,863
OFTEN USED BY MAGICIANS.

326
00:14:22,946 --> 00:14:25,282
YOU EXPOSE IT TO HEAT,
AND...

327
00:14:25,365 --> 00:14:28,202
(WHOOSH)
NINERS: WHOA! (LAUGHS)

328
00:14:28,285 --> 00:14:29,244

00:14:31,997 --> 00:14:33,081
NOW DOES ANYONE
KNOW WHAT IT IS?

331
00:14:33,165 --> 00:14:34,917
BIANCA:
THOUGHT YOU BAILED
ON ME AGAIN.

332
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,293
DREW:
LOOK, BIANCA,

333
00:14:36,376 --> 00:14:37,961
I KNOW THIS ISN'T GONNA
FIX EVERYTHING,

334
00:14:38,045 --> 00:14:39,463
BUT IT'S A START.

335
00:14:46,053 --> 00:14:47,804
A PROM TICKET?

336
00:14:47,888 --> 00:14:49,598
THERE'S AN EXTRA SEAT

00:14:52,392 --> 00:14:54,561
AND YOUR GIRLFRIEND
DOESN'T MIND?

340
00:14:54,645 --> 00:14:57,439
NO. SHE'LL BE COOL.
IT'S FINE.

341
00:14:57,523 --> 00:15:00,234
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO SAY.

342
00:15:00,317 --> 00:15:01,652
HERE. I'LL PUT IT
IN YOUR PURSE.

343
00:15:02,653 --> 00:15:04,363
DON'T WANT YOU
TO MISS THE SHOW.

344
00:15:04,446 --> 00:15:05,781
MR. BETENKAMP:
NEAT, HUH?

345
00:15:05,864 --> 00:15:08,242
OKAY, I GOT ONE MORE
TRICK FOR YA.

346
00:15:09,243 --> 00:15:11,703
WHAT DO YOU THINK WILL HAPPEN
WHEN I ADD YEAST

347
00:15:11,787 --> 00:15:14,206
TO HYDROGEN PEROXIDE?

348
00:15:14,289 --> 00:15:16,041
HA. WATCH THIS,

349
00:15:17,584 --> 00:15:20,170
LIKE THE PRIDE YOU WILL SOON
HAVE IN YOUR NEW SCHOOL

350
00:15:20,254 --> 00:15:23,257
THE BEAKER IS OVERFLOWING
WITH DEGRASSI BLUE! (LAUGHS)

351
00:15:32,432 --> 00:15:36,186
JAKE: OH, THANK YOU.
MRS. EDWARDS: SURE.

352
00:15:36,270 --> 00:15:37,396
LIGHT OR DARK MEAT?

353
00:15:37,479 --> 00:15:41,400
GLENN:
OH C'MON, HELEN,
YOU KNOW, I'M A LEG MAN.

354
00:15:41,483 --> 00:15:44,111
MRS. EDWARDS:
GLENN! (LAUGHS)

355
00:15:45,153 --> 00:15:47,573
I CAN'T BELIEVE WE'RE
MISSING PROM FOR THIS.

356
00:15:47,656 --> 00:15:52,244
JAKE:
SO MRS- HELEN, YOU THINK
YOU AND CLARE WILL BRAVE

357
00:15:52,327 --> 00:15:53,745
THE CABIN THIS SUMMER?

358
00:15:53,829 --> 00:15:56,790
MRS. EDWARDS:
YOUR FATHER'S BEEN TRYING
TO GET ME TO GO UP THERE.

359
00:15:56,874 --> 00:15:57,541
WHAT'S IT LIKE?

360
00:15:57,624 --> 00:15:59,793
OH THIS TIME OF YEAR
IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

361
00:15:59,877 --> 00:16:01,420
THE WOLVES ARE HOWLING,
THE FISH ARE BITING,

362
00:16:01,503 --> 00:16:04,923
AND THE ONLY TWEETS
ARE MADE BY BIRDS. (LAUGHS)

363
00:16:05,007 --> 00:16:06,675
MRS. EDWARDS:
SOUNDS RUSTIC.

364
00:16:06,758 --> 00:16:08,051
JUST THINK IT'S JUST
IMPORTANT THAT

365
00:16:08,135 --> 00:16:10,762
WE SPEND MORE TIME TOGETHER.

366
00:16:10,846 --> 00:16:12,055
GLENN:
WELL, I COULDN'T AGREE MORE,
JAKE.

367
00:16:12,139 --> 00:16:15,893
WHICH IS WHY I THINK IT'S TIME
FOR A LITTLE ANNOUNCEMENT.

368
00:16:19,313 --> 00:16:21,899
MRS. EDWARDS:
THIS MAY SEEM SUDDEN BUT...

369
00:16:21,982 --> 00:16:24,193
GLENN AND I HAVE KNOWN EACH
OTHER FOR A LONG TIME,

370
00:16:24,276 --> 00:16:27,321
AND WE LOVE EACH OTHER
VERY MUCH, SO-

371
00:16:28,989 --> 00:16:29,990
OH NO.

372
00:16:31,074 --> 00:16:34,077
WE'RE GETTING MARRIED!
(GIGGLES)

373
00:16:34,161 --> 00:16:35,746
JAKE:
THAT'S SO GREAT!

374
00:16:35,829 --> 00:16:38,373
OH, CONGRATULATIONS!

375
00:16:38,457 --> 00:16:41,084
ISN'T THAT GREAT, CLARE?

376
00:16:41,168 --> 00:16:43,420
MRS. EDWARDS:
CLARE-BEAR?

377
00:16:44,421 --> 00:16:46,465
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY.

378
00:16:46,548 --> 00:16:49,051
I GUESS WE'RE JUST
REALLY SURPRISED.

379
00:16:53,555 --> 00:16:55,724
MO:
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU'RE
JUST GONNA LET IT GO.

380
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:57,100
MS. OH IS A WOMAN!

381
00:16:57,184 --> 00:16:58,602
I DON'T HAVE ANY OTHER
CHOICE, MAN.

382
00:16:58,685 --> 00:17:00,270
THERE'S NOWHERE PRIVATE ROOMS
AT THE PROM VENUE.

383
00:17:00,354 --> 00:17:02,940
AND AFTER THAT,
WE'RE BOTH AWAY.

384
00:17:03,023 --> 00:17:04,650
MAYBE WE'LL HOOK UP
SOME DAY, BUT...

385
00:17:04,733 --> 00:17:06,818
SOME DAY? SAV, IF YOU DON'T
PROVE YOU'RE THE MAN NOW,

386
00:17:06,902 --> 00:17:09,112
SHE'S ALWAYS GONNA SEE YOU
AS A STUDENT. A KID.

387
00:17:09,196 --> 00:17:10,322
OKAY, SO WHAT DO YOU
WANT ME TO DO?

388
00:17:10,405 --> 00:17:12,115
FIND A WAY!
OVERCOME THE ODDS!

389
00:17:12,199 --> 00:17:15,494
CREATE A MOVIE-LEVEL ROMANTIC
MOMENT, AND GET THE GIRL!

390
00:17:15,577 --> 00:17:16,787
DID YOU GROW THE BEARD
FOR NOTHING?

391
00:17:16,870 --> 00:17:18,163
NO.

392
00:17:18,247 --> 00:17:20,290
THEN PUT IT TO USE.
TONIGHT.

393
00:17:20,374 --> 00:17:22,084
YOU IN A TUX.
LOOKING MANLY.

394
00:17:22,167 --> 00:17:23,836
MS. OH IN A SLINKY DRESS.

395
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:26,380
ROMANTIC MUSIC
IN THE AIR...

396
00:17:26,463 --> 00:17:27,840
YEAH. NO, IT'S GOT
TO BE TONIGHT.

397
00:17:27,923 --> 00:17:28,966
IT HAS TO BE TONIGHT.

398
00:17:29,049 --> 00:17:30,467
OKAY BUT, LIKE, HOW?

399
00:17:30,551 --> 00:17:33,971
WHERE DO I UNLEASH
THIS ROMANCE?

400
00:17:34,054 --> 00:17:37,599
YOU KNOW WHERE EVERYONE
AT DEGRASSI WON'T BE TONIGHT?

401
00:17:39,601 --> 00:17:40,602
DEGRASSI!

402
00:17:40,686 --> 00:17:43,397
IT HAS TO BE TONIGHT,
DUDE.

403
00:18:02,666 --> 00:18:06,128
WHOA, MAN. DON'T YOU HAVE
A RESTRAINING ORDER?

404
00:18:06,211 --> 00:18:08,213
I AIN'T TRYING
TO CATCH ANY TROUBLE.

405
00:18:08,297 --> 00:18:09,590
I WON'T TATTLE
IF YOU DON'T.

406
00:18:09,673 --> 00:18:10,424
WHERE'S B?

407
00:18:10,507 --> 00:18:12,676
SHE COULDN'T MAKE IT.

408
00:18:12,759 --> 00:18:15,512
I'VE BEEN AFRAID OF YOU
FOR FAR TOO LONG.

409
00:18:15,596 --> 00:18:17,306
I'M NOT BACKING DOWN NOW.

410
00:18:17,389 --> 00:18:18,640
YOU LOOKING FOR A FIGHT?

411
00:18:18,724 --> 00:18:19,725
NO...

412
00:18:21,268 --> 00:18:23,270
I JUST WANNA TALK.

413
00:18:31,236 --> 00:18:33,238
ALL RIGHT...

414
00:18:33,322 --> 00:18:34,990
I'M LISTENING.

415
00:18:44,208 --> 00:18:45,459
SO...

416
00:18:45,667 --> 00:18:46,585
DON'T YOU THINK
IT'S A TAD QUICK

417
00:18:46,668 --> 00:18:48,754
TO BE GETTING MARRIED?

418
00:18:48,837 --> 00:18:51,632
I DON'T KNOW.
WE BOTH KNOW WE WANT THIS.

419
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:53,509
WHY WAIT?

420
00:18:53,592 --> 00:18:54,927
BECAUSE YOU JUST
GOT DIVORCED?

421
00:18:55,010 --> 00:18:57,387
CLARE, WE'RE NOT GETTING
YOUNGER.

422
00:18:57,471 --> 00:18:59,348
COMPANIONSHIP IS IMPORTANT
AT OUR AGE.

423
00:18:59,431 --> 00:19:01,642
AND WE LOVE EACH OTHER.

424
00:19:01,725 --> 00:19:03,018
CLARE:
AND WHAT ABOUT ME?

425
00:19:03,101 --> 00:19:05,312
DID YOU FEEL LIKE INVOLVING ME
IN THIS DECISION?

426
00:19:05,395 --> 00:19:06,813
MRS. EDWARDS:
OH.

427
00:19:06,897 --> 00:19:08,774
WELL, I MEAN...

428
00:19:08,857 --> 00:19:11,068
OF COURSE WE WANT YOU
TO BE INVOLVED.

429
00:19:11,151 --> 00:19:13,278
I WAS HOPING YOU'D BE
MY MAID OF HONOUR.

430
00:19:13,362 --> 00:19:14,321
GOODIE.

431
00:19:14,404 --> 00:19:15,906
JAKE:
IS THAT THE REAL -
REAL TIME?

432
00:19:15,989 --> 00:19:17,533
CAN WE GET A LIFT
TO PROM, DAD?

433
00:19:17,616 --> 00:19:19,368
CLARE, YOU HAVE
TO VOLUNTEER, RIGHT?

434
00:19:19,451 --> 00:19:21,703
HOW CAN YOU NOT BE
FREAKING OUT RIGHT NOW?

435
00:19:21,787 --> 00:19:25,290
LET'S JUST GET READY
FOR PROM. DAD?

436
00:19:25,374 --> 00:19:27,709
UH YEAH, I THINK
WE'RE ALL DONE HERE.

437
00:19:27,793 --> 00:19:29,253
CLARE:
NO... NO, NOT YET.

438
00:19:29,336 --> 00:19:31,046
I HAVE AN ANNOUNCEMENT,
TOO.

439
00:19:31,129 --> 00:19:32,172
JAKE AND I ARE DATING.

440
00:19:32,256 --> 00:19:32,840
(CHOKING)

441
00:19:32,923 --> 00:19:36,301
WE HAVE BEEN FOR A WHILE.
PROBABLY AS LONG AS YOU TWO.

442
00:19:36,385 --> 00:19:37,553
JAKE?

443
00:19:37,636 --> 00:19:38,679
MRS. EDWARDS:
YOU CAN'T BE SERIOUS!

444
00:19:38,762 --> 00:19:40,430
CLARE:
YUP. WE'VE ALL GOT
SURPRISES.

445
00:19:40,514 --> 00:19:41,557
MRS. EDWARDS:
WELL THEN...

446
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:44,017
I'M SORRY, BUT IT OBVIOUSLY
HAS TO STOP.

447
00:19:44,101 --> 00:19:45,227
REALLY?

448
00:19:45,310 --> 00:19:48,063
REALLY MOM?
YOU'RE GONNA DROP THIS BOMB,

449
00:19:48,146 --> 00:19:51,358
AND THEN TRY TO TELL ME
WHAT TO DO?

450
00:19:51,441 --> 00:19:52,234
I'M OUT OF HERE.

451
00:19:52,317 --> 00:19:53,610
MRS. EDWARDS:
LET'S TALK ABOUT THIS.

452
00:19:53,694 --> 00:19:54,319
JAKE:
CLARE...

453
00:19:54,403 --> 00:19:55,904
DON'T. JUST...

454
00:19:57,364 --> 00:19:59,199
I'LL MEET YOU AT PROM.
I NEED SOME TIME.

455
00:20:11,545 --> 00:20:14,256
BIANCA AND ME?
OUR DEBTS ARE PAID.

456
00:20:14,339 --> 00:20:15,382
THAT SO?

457
00:20:15,465 --> 00:20:18,760
WELL, BETWEEN THE BEATDOWN
YOUR THUGS GAVE ME

458
00:20:18,844 --> 00:20:22,097
AND ALL THE EXTRA TIME
BIANCA'S PUT IN...

459
00:20:22,181 --> 00:20:23,473
I'D SAY WE'RE PRETTY
WELL EVEN.

460
00:20:23,557 --> 00:20:25,976
BIANCA TALKS A LOT
LIKE THAT.

461
00:20:26,059 --> 00:20:27,436
ALWAYS COMES BACK,
THOUGH.

462
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:30,230
NOT THIS TIME.
THIS ENDS NOW.

463
00:20:30,314 --> 00:20:31,773
OR YOU'LL FIND YOURSELF
IN A LOT MORE TROUBLE

464
00:20:31,857 --> 00:20:34,109
THAN VIOLATING
A RESTRAINING ORDER.

465
00:20:34,193 --> 00:20:36,361
BIANCA KNOWS THINGS.

466
00:20:37,529 --> 00:20:38,530
A'IGHT.

467
00:20:39,823 --> 00:20:41,033
FINE.
I'LL STAY AWAY.

468
00:20:41,116 --> 00:20:42,618
(CELL RINGS)

469
00:20:49,041 --> 00:20:50,042
HELLO?

470
00:20:51,627 --> 00:20:53,670
OH, HEY BIANCA.

471
00:20:53,754 --> 00:20:55,881
YEAH,
I HAVE YOUR PHONE?

472
00:20:55,964 --> 00:20:57,799
SORRY, I MUST'VE GRABBED IT
BY ACCIDENT.

473
00:21:00,385 --> 00:21:03,722
YEAH, OF COURSE
WE'RE STILL ON FOR PROM.

474
00:21:03,805 --> 00:21:06,225
YEAH,
I'LL MEET YOU THERE.

475
00:21:06,308 --> 00:21:07,643
OKAY, BYE.

476
00:21:15,943 --> 00:21:18,362
SO THIS IS OVER, RIGHT?

477
00:21:20,239 --> 00:21:21,907
YEAH, MAN.
IT'S OVER.
