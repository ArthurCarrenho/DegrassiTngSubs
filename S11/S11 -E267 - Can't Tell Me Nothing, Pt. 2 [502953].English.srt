I'VE BEEN KEEPING NOTES.

175
00:07:14,184 --> 00:07:16,061
BREAKS INTO SCHOOL,
DENIES BLAME,

176
00:07:16,144 --> 00:07:19,398
PASSES RESPONSIBILITIES OFF
ON IDIOT VP,

177
00:07:19,481 --> 00:07:21,525
CAUSING EVENTS TO FAIL.

178
00:07:21,608 --> 00:07:24,361
SOUNDS LIKE A GOOD CASE
FOR IMPEACHMENT, NO?

179
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:26,905
TA-TA FOR NOW!

180
00:07:26,989 --> 00:07:28,282
KATIE, SHE'S OVERREACTING.

181
00:07:28,365 --> 00:07:30,701
THIS EVENT IS GOING
TO BE AWESOME!

182
00:07:30,784 --> 00:07:32,494
YES,
BECAUSE I'M TAKING OVER.

183
00:07:32,578 --> 00:07:34,079
NO, I PROMISED!

184
00:07:34,162 --> 00:07:35,414
I CAN DO THIS!

185
00:07:35,497 --> 00:07:38,125
I CAN HANDLE IT! GO.

186
00:07:57,811 --> 00:08:00,397
HEY! I'VE BEEN THINKING
ABOUT MY SONG,

187
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,565
AND YOU WERE RIGHT.

188
00:08:01,648 --> 00:08:03,025
THERE WASN'T A PART
FOR YOU.

189
00:08:03,108 --> 00:08:04,484
SO, I WROTE ONE.

190
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:07,279
TORI AND I WILL HARMONIZE
THE CHORUS,

191
00:08:07,362 --> 00:08:08,739
AND YOU COULD SING
THE BRIDGE.

192
00:08:08,822 --> 00:08:10,032
IT'S SHORT.

193
00:08:10,115 --> 00:08:12,367
OKAY, OR UM...

194
00:08:12,451 --> 00:08:15,495
MAYBE WE COULD DO
THIS INSTEAD?

195
00:08:15,579 --> 00:08:17,247
THAT'S A LOT OF WORDS.

196
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:19,917
NO...

197
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,210
IS THIS A RAP?

198
00:08:21,293 --> 00:08:23,337
WELL, YEAH.
SEE, LIKE I THOUGHT...

199
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:25,422
THE SONG COULD BE
A BATTLE OVER TORI.

200
00:08:25,506 --> 00:08:27,132
YOU COULD SING,
AND I'LL RAP.

201
00:08:27,216 --> 00:08:28,342
YOU SHOULD READ
THE LYRICS, TRIS,

202
00:08:28,425 --> 00:08:29,676
THEY'RE REALLY FUNNY.

203
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:32,137
"HALF-HEARTED" IS NOT SUPPOSED
TO BE FUNNY!

204
00:08:32,221 --> 00:08:34,681
ZIG:
W-WELL, PEOPLE ARE GOING
TO LAUGH EITHER WAY, RIGHT?

205
00:08:34,765 --> 00:08:38,185
SO I JUST THOUGHT,
YOU KNOW, GO FOR IT!

206
00:08:38,268 --> 00:08:39,603
AND YOU SUPPORT THIS?

207
00:08:39,686 --> 00:08:41,813
"HALF-HEARTED" WAS A HIT
AT SUMMER CAMP,

208
00:08:41,897 --> 00:08:45,108
BUT MAYBE IT'S NOT RIGHT
FOR A HIGH SCHOOL COFFEE HOUSE.

209
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:48,987
MAYBE IT'S A LITTLE UM...

210
00:08:49,071 --> 00:08:50,239
CAMPY.

211
00:08:50,322 --> 00:08:51,949
YOU THINK I'M CAMPY?!

212
00:08:52,032 --> 00:08:53,951
TRIS, T-THAT'S NOT WHAT
ZIG MEANT.

213
00:08:54,034 --> 00:08:54,993
YEAH, SORRY.

214
00:08:55,077 --> 00:08:57,496
DON'T BE!
I APPRECIATE THE HONESTY.

233
00:09:41,415 --> 00:09:43,709

I DON'T CARE ANYMORE,
I WISH KC WAS DEAD!

278
00:11:12,089 --> 00:11:13,549
IS THIS ABOUT
HIS POEM STUNT?

279
00:11:13,632 --> 00:11:15,050

DETENTION STARTING TOMORROW

SO I DON'T MISS MY TRYOUT,
THANK GOD!

288
00:11:36,363 --> 00:11:37,281
DO I NEED TO MENTION

289
00:11:37,364 --> 00:11:38,282
MOM WON'T BE FINDING OUT
ABOUT THIS?

290
00:11:38,365 --> 00:11:40,701
I'M NOT GONNA TELL,
KATIE!

291
00:11:40,784 --> 00:11:43,287
I'M JUST...
KIND OF WORRIED.

292
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:45,497
OKAY, THESE TRYOUTS,
THEY'RE MAKING YOU CRAZY!

293
00:11:45,581 --> 00:11:48,959

PART OF MY LIFE"

294

I'M FINE!

296
00:11:52,546 --> 00:11:53,463
CAN YOU RUN ON THAT?

297
00:11:53,547 --> 00:11:55,549
WILL YOU BE ABLE
TO KICK IN A GAME?

298
00:11:55,632 --> 00:11:57,050
I'LL BE OKAY
ONCE I GET OUT THERE.

299
00:11:57,134 --> 00:11:58,177
THE ADRENALINE WILL
KICK IN.

300
00:11:58,260 --> 00:11:59,970
AND MOM'S CODEINE.

301
00:12:00,971 --> 00:12:02,639
WHY DO YOU CARE SO MUCH,
ANYWAY?

302
00:12:02,723 --> 00:12:04,766
BECAUSE I LOOKED UP
KNEE INJURIES!

303
00:12:04,850 --> 00:12:07,895
TORN ACL,
DISLOCATED MENISC-SOMETHING,

AND I DON'T HAVE ANY
OF THEM!

307
00:12:12,608 --> 00:12:14,193
IS THAT WHAT THE DOCTOR
TOLD YOU?

308
00:12:14,276 --> 00:12:15,485
WHAT'D YOU DO
IF SOMEONE TOLD YOU

309
00:12:15,569 --> 00:12:16,862
YOUR DREAM OF PLAYING CELLO

310
00:12:16,945 --> 00:12:19,031
FOR THE NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC
WAS DEAD?

311
00:12:19,114 --> 00:12:20,365
THAT ALL THOSE HOURS
OF PRACTICE,

312
00:12:20,449 --> 00:12:24,244
AND ALL THOSE SACRIFICES
WERE FOR NOTHING!

313
00:12:24,328 --> 00:12:26,788
I'D TELL THEM
TO EAT MY BOW.

314
00:12:26,872 --> 00:12:30,542
I HAVE ONE LAST SHOT
AT MAKING THIS TEAM,

315
00:12:30,626 --> 00:12:31,585
TONIGHT,

316
00:12:31,668 --> 00:12:34,796
AND I'M NOT GIVING THAT UP
FOR ANYTHING!

317
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:35,964
IT'S A GOOD THING
OUR HOUSE

318
00:12:36,048 --> 00:12:39,343
IS ALREADY WHEELCHAIR
ACCESSIBLE!

WELL, I'M THE QUARTERBACK,
AND I CAN'T EVEN DO THAT!

322
00:12:46,225 --> 00:12:48,101
OKAY, WELL, WE'LL SEE, BUDDY!

323
00:12:48,185 --> 00:12:49,645
ALL RIGHT, I'M GONNA CATCH UP
WITH YOU IN A MINUTE, OKAY?

324
00:12:49,728 --> 00:12:51,647
DREW:
ALL RIGHT, MAN.

325
00:12:52,648 --> 00:12:53,815
(CLEARS HIS THROAT)

326
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:58,737
WHAT'S WRONG THIS TIME?

327
00:13:01,114 --> 00:13:04,284
TORI'S STUPID BOYFRIEND
RUINED EVERYTHING!

328
00:13:04,368 --> 00:13:05,702
THE THREE OF US WERE GOING
TO DO A MUSICAL NUMBER

329
00:13:05,786 --> 00:13:07,162
FOR THE COFFEE HOUSE,

330
00:13:07,246 --> 00:13:10,582
AND HE WANTED TO RUIN IT
WITH SOME STUPID RAP.

331
00:13:12,417 --> 00:13:14,169
SO?

332
00:13:14,253 --> 00:13:16,421
SO I HAD TO CALL IT OFF.

333
00:13:16,505 --> 00:13:18,757
HE SAID PEOPLE WOULD
LAUGH AT ME.

334
00:13:18,841 --> 00:13:22,052
HE MADE A MOCKERY OF MY SONG,
OF ME!

335
00:13:22,135 --> 00:13:24,054
AND WORST OF ALL,

336
00:13:24,137 --> 00:13:26,223
TORI TOOK HIS SIDE.

337
00:13:27,558 --> 00:13:29,184
DUDE, YOU REMEMBER WHEN
YOU WERE LIKE SEVEN,

338
00:13:29,268 --> 00:13:31,979
AND YOU PUT ON THAT PLAY
FOR ALL THE NEIGHBOURHOOD KIDS?

339
00:13:32,062 --> 00:13:34,648
MAGIC, MIGHT,
AND THE BRAVE KNIGHT?

340
00:13:34,731 --> 00:13:37,317
OH JEEZ, IS THAT
WHAT IT WAS CALLED?

341
00:13:37,401 --> 00:13:39,319
ANYWAY, MOM AND DAD SAID
WE SHOULD COME

342
00:13:39,403 --> 00:13:41,697
AND SUPPORT
ALL YOUR ARTSY STUFF.

343
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:44,324
AND IF I RECALL,
I GOT A STANDING OVATION.

344
00:13:44,408 --> 00:13:45,450
WHAT'S YOUR POINT?

345
00:13:45,534 --> 00:13:46,743
(CLEARS THROAT)

346
00:13:46,827 --> 00:13:49,663
WELL, THE REASON YOU DIDN'T
