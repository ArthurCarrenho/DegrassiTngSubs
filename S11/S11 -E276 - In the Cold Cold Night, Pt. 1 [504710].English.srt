3
00:00:07,674 --> 00:00:08,926
ARE WE ON A MISSION?

4
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:10,886
RUMOUR IS KATIE HAS
A LITTLE PILL PROBLEM

5
00:00:10,969 --> 00:00:12,763
AND NOW SHE'S MISSING SCHOOL
FOR REHAB.

6
00:00:12,846 --> 00:00:14,765
WOW! AND WE DIDN'T EVEN
HAVE TO DO ANYTHING.

7
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:15,766
WE'VE BEEN WAITING
PATIENTLY

8
00:00:15,849 --> 00:00:17,309
SINCE KATIE AND MARISOL
BACKSTABBED US,

9
00:00:17,392 --> 00:00:18,435
AND NOW THE USELESS

10
00:00:18,519 --> 00:00:19,811
CHEERLEADER-JOCK
STUDENT COUNCIL'S

11
00:00:19,895 --> 00:00:21,438
RIPE FOR THE TAKING.

12
00:00:21,522 --> 00:00:23,023
MARISOL:
GUYS! GUYS!

13
00:00:24,024 --> 00:00:26,443
UNTIL KATIE GETS BACK,
I'M ACTING PRESIDENT.

14
00:00:26,527 --> 00:00:28,654
SO TAKE A NUMBER
AND I WILL GET TO YOU!

15
00:00:28,737 --> 00:00:30,197
THIS IS GONNA BE EASIER
THAN I THOUGHT.

16
00:00:31,406 --> 00:00:32,449
YEAH, WELL, KATIE SAID

17
00:00:32,533 --> 00:00:35,953
THAT SHE'D ASK MR. SIMPSON
ABOUT THE UNIFORMS?

18
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:37,579
WELL, SHE'S NOT KATIE,
IS SHE?

19
00:00:37,663 --> 00:00:40,290
FIONA:
YOU'RE RIGHT ABOUT THAT.

20
00:00:40,374 --> 00:00:42,751
MARISOL, YOU'RE CLEARLY IN
WAY OVER YOUR HEAD,

21
00:00:42,835 --> 00:00:44,670
SO IMOGEN AND I WOULD
LIKE TO HELP.

22
00:00:44,753 --> 00:00:46,171
WE HAVE AN IDEA
FOR AN ERA-DEFINING

23
00:00:46,255 --> 00:00:47,673
END-OF-SEMESTER EVENT.

24
00:00:47,756 --> 00:00:48,715
WE DO?

25
00:00:48,799 --> 00:00:50,133
MARISOL:
YOU KNOW I'M SOCIAL CONVENER.

26
00:00:50,217 --> 00:00:51,718
AND WE'VE HAD, WHAT,
ZERO DANCES?

27
00:00:51,802 --> 00:00:52,845
NO MOVIE NIGHTS.

28
00:00:52,928 --> 00:00:54,805
REMIND ME, HAS ANYTHING FUN
HAPPENED THIS YEAR?

29

NO...

30

31
00:00:57,224 --> 00:00:58,600
AN IDEA YOU STOLE
FROM ME.

32
00:00:58,684 --> 00:01:00,477
LISTEN, MS. KNOW-IT-ALL,

33
00:01:00,561 --> 00:01:03,313
SINCE VEGAS NIGHT AND PROM
BOTH ENDED IN VIOLENCE,

34
00:01:03,397 --> 00:01:05,774
SIMPSON HAS BANNED ANYMORE
AFTER-SCHOOL EVENTS.

35
00:01:05,858 --> 00:01:07,526
SO YOUR JOB'S BEEN
PRETTY EASY, THEN.

36
00:01:07,609 --> 00:01:09,278
AND IF YOU THINK
I'M GONNA PLAY DEAD

37
00:01:09,361 --> 00:01:11,989
JUST BECAUSE KATIE'S
NOT HERE,

38
00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:13,866

UH, SHE'S DEALING
WITH SOME PERSONAL ISSUES,

66
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:40,077
SO SHE'S NOT GONNA BE BACK

74
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:56,426

TO PULL IT OFF.

RETURN THE FEELINGS,

AND I WAS HOPING TO CONVINCE
SOME OF YOU TO JOIN MY TEAM.

188
00:06:57,584 --> 00:06:59,711
IT'S AN EASY
EXTRA-CURRICULAR

189
00:06:59,795 --> 00:07:01,255
AND YOU CAN WRITE

190

ISN'T THERE ALREADY
A NEWSPAPER STAFF?

191
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:06,510
THEY TOOK AN EARLY HOLIDAY.

192
00:07:06,593 --> 00:07:08,720
I COULD USE ALL THE HELP
I CAN GET.

193
00:07:08,804 --> 00:07:11,431
AND WHY SHOULD WE
HELP YOU?

194
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:13,433

00:07:29,157 --> 00:07:30,158
MOM?

197
00:07:32,953 --> 00:07:34,538

198
00:07:34,621 --> 00:07:36,540
LARA:
I CAN NEVER FIND
MY PASSPORT!

199
00:07:36,623 --> 00:07:38,083
YOU GOING SOMEWHERE?

200
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:41,086
LARA:
I'M FLYING HOME
FOR MORE ACCOUNTANT MEETINGS.

201
00:07:41,170 --> 00:07:42,629
OH, VOILA!

202
00:07:42,713 --> 00:07:44,173
FIONA:
ARE THOSE TAX PEOPLE
STILL PUNISHING YOU

203
00:07:44,256 --> 00:07:46,550
FOR BEING GOOD
AT FUNDRAISING?

204
00:07:46,633 --> 00:07:48,051
LARA:
WITH THE MONEY
WE GIVE TO CHARITY,

205
00:07:48,135 --> 00:07:50,387
THEY SHOULD BE THANKING ME.

206
00:07:52,097 --> 00:07:54,224
THE LAWYERS SAY
IT'LL ALL BE OVER SOON.

207
00:07:54,308 --> 00:07:55,601
I'LL BE BACK
IN A FEW DAYS.

208
00:07:55,684 --> 00:07:58,896
OKAY, UH... BEFORE YOU GO,
JUST LISTEN.

209
00:07:58,979 --> 00:08:00,397
FIRST SEMESTER'S
ALMOST OVER,

210
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,315
AND I HAVEN'T DONE ANYTHING

211
00:08:01,398 --> 00:08:03,233
I SET OUT TO ACCOMPLISH
THIS YEAR.

212
00:08:03,317 --> 00:08:04,985
WELL, IT'S NEVER
TOO LATE TO START.

213
00:08:05,068 --> 00:08:05,986
EXACTLY.

214
00:08:06,069 --> 00:08:07,571
SO THAT'S WHY I WANNA THROW
A SCHOOL CARNIVAL

215
00:08:07,654 --> 00:08:08,572
TO SHOW EVERYONE

216
00:08:08,655 --> 00:08:10,407
WHY I DESERVE A SEAT
ON STUDENT COUNCIL.

217
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:12,034
SO I JUST NEED AN ADVANCE
ON MY TRUST FUND

218
00:08:12,117 --> 00:08:15,245
SO I CAN PAY
FOR THE CARNIVAL RIDES.

219
00:08:15,329 --> 00:08:17,915
IT'S NOT POSSIBLE,
SWEETHEART.

220
00:08:17,998 --> 00:08:19,875
I'LL PAY YOU BACK
THE DAY I TURN EIGHTEEN!

221
00:08:19,958 --> 00:08:21,251
LARA:
I'M SORRY.

222
00:08:21,335 --> 00:08:22,377
YOU'RE JUST GONNA HAVE
TO FIND ANOTHER WAY

223
00:08:22,461 --> 00:08:23,378
TO IMPRESS DEGRASSI

224
00:08:23,462 --> 00:08:24,588
THAT WON'T DRAIN OUR SAVINGS.

225
00:08:24,671 --> 00:08:25,923
I'M NOT DRAINING ANYTHING!

226
00:08:26,006 --> 00:08:28,091
WHY ARE YOU BEING
SO WEIRD ABOUT THIS?

227
00:08:28,175 --> 00:08:29,343
IT'S FINAL, FIONA.

228
00:08:30,344 --> 00:08:31,929
THE LIMO'S WAITING.

229
00:08:32,012 --> 00:08:33,388

WHAT'S WRONG?

244
00:09:23,272 --> 00:09:25,023
GRADE NINE BAND
HAS BEEN TERRIBLE.

245
00:09:25,107 --> 00:09:29,444
IT'S LIKE I'M PLAYING
WITH A BUNCH OF IDOL REJECTS.

246
00:09:29,528 --> 00:09:31,154
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS
WHEN YOU'RE SO TALENTED.

247
00:09:31,238 --> 00:09:33,323
NO, WHAT HAPPENS
WHEN YOU'RE SO TALENTED

248
00:09:33,407 --> 00:09:35,200
IS YOU GET SENT
TO ARTS SCHOOL.

249
00:09:35,284 --> 00:09:36,493
BUT SINCE I'M STUCK
AT DEGRASSI,

250

253
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:41,290
HAVE YOU TALKED
TO MS. OH?

254
00:09:41,373 --> 00:09:42,875

MAYA:
AS YOU CAN PROBABLY TELL,

00:11:58,844 --> 00:12:00,596
I'VE BEEN FRUSTRATED
IN BAND CLASS.

SOME MORE CHALLENGING
PROJECTS.

329
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:25,913
YOU COULD SIT ASIDE
AND STUDY THEORY

330
00:12:25,996 --> 00:12:28,624
FOR THE REST OF THE YEAR.

331
00:12:28,707 --> 00:12:31,084
SO I WOULDN'T BE PLAYING
WITH THE BAND?

332
00:12:31,168 --> 00:12:36,006
WELL, THEY'LL MISS YOU,
BUT IF IT'LL MAKE YOU HAPPY.

00:13:26,932 --> 00:13:28,684
I THINK IT'S JUST GONNA BE
THE THREE OF US.

353
00:13:28,767 --> 00:13:30,185
WELL, WE NEED WAY MORE HELP.

354
00:13:30,269 --> 00:13:32,020
CAN'T YOU JUST TALK TO ALLI
AND WORK THINGS OUT?

355
00:13:32,104 --> 00:13:33,021
YOU SAW FOR YOURSELF,

356
00:13:33,105 --> 00:13:35,691
WE'RE NOT EXACTLY
ON SPEAKING TERMS.

358
00:13:36,984 --> 00:13:37,901

IT'S TOO BAD
WE CAN'T ALL BE FRIENDS

359
00:13:37,985 --> 00:13:39,444
LIKE WE USED TO BE.

360

IS A) MILD,

WELL, COMPARED TO THE ONE
WE GOT FROM MARISOL?

363
00:13:49,454 --> 00:13:51,623
I'D SAY MILD AT BEST.

364
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:56,253
YOU KNOW, THIS YEAR WOULD'VE
BEEN PAINFUL WITHOUT YOU.

365
00:13:56,336 --> 00:13:59,089
I'M GLAD
YOU'RE ON MY SIDE.

366
00:14:00,966 --> 00:14:04,303
SO WAS THERE ANY TRUTH
TO WHAT MARISOL SAID?

367
00:14:04,386 --> 00:14:06,096
I'M NOT GONNA APOLOGIZE
FOR USING MY MONEY-

368
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:09,474
NO! I MEAN, WHAT SHE SAID
ABOUT IMPRESSING ME -

369
00:14:09,558 --> 00:14:11,518
WHICH YOU ARE NAILING,
BY THE WAY.

A VIGOROUS REACTION.

OOPS!
WE NEED MORE REACTANT.

373
00:14:22,404 --> 00:14:24,114
IMOGEN'S QUITE IMPRESSED,
I'D SAY.

374
00:14:24,198 --> 00:14:26,158
SOUNDS LIKE SHE'S HOLDING
THAT CRUSH DOOR WIDE OPEN.

375
00:14:26,241 --> 00:14:27,201
YEAH. VERY FUNNY.

376
00:14:27,284 --> 00:14:28,243
WHAT?
IT COULD MEAN SOMETHING.

377
00:14:28,327 --> 00:14:32,247
OR IT COULD JUST BE
IMOGEN BEING IMOGEN.

378
00:14:33,624 --> 00:14:35,584
WOULD YOU HATE ME
IF ANYTHING HAPPENED?

379
00:14:35,667 --> 00:14:37,211
SHE AND I ARE BETTER
AS FRIENDS.

380
00:14:37,294 --> 00:14:38,212
AND ALL I KNOW IS THAT

381
00:14:38,295 --> 00:14:39,713
LIFE IS TOO SHORT
TO WONDER WHAT IF.

382
00:14:39,796 --> 00:14:41,048

SO SELF-OBSESSED,

STILL HAVE MY KEY!

518
00:21:12,981 --> 00:21:14,399
OH, I'M SO GLAD
YOU'RE HERE.

519
00:21:14,483 --> 00:21:16,151
IT'S GONNA BE OKAY.

520
00:21:16,235 --> 00:21:17,444
HEY, MRS. COYNE.

521
00:21:17,528 --> 00:21:19,196
HI, SWEETHEART.

522
00:21:19,279 --> 00:21:20,989
HOLLY J'S GOING TO HELP YOU
GET THINGS ORGANIZED

523
00:21:21,073 --> 00:21:22,491
BEFORE YOU COME HERE.

524
00:21:22,574 --> 00:21:23,909
RIGHT. I MIGHT SQUEEZE IN
A QUICK VISIT

525
00:21:23,992 --> 00:21:25,536
WITH MY PARENTS TOO.

526
00:21:25,619 --> 00:21:28,830
MOM, I CAN PACK
A WEEKEND BAG BY MYSELF.

527
00:21:28,914 --> 00:21:31,375
IT'S GONNA BE A LITTLE BIT
LONGER THAN THAT.

528
00:21:31,458 --> 00:21:33,252
WHAT? WHY?

529
00:21:33,335 --> 00:21:35,087
LARA:
OUR FAMILY'S IN TROUBLE,
FIONA.

530
00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:36,922
I CAN'T HAVE YOU
LIVING IN ANOTHER CITY

531
00:21:37,005 --> 00:21:40,008
WITHOUT A SUPPORT SYSTEM.

532
00:21:40,092 --> 00:21:42,845
I'M BRINGING YOU BACK
TO NEW YORK.

533
00:21:44,429 --> 00:21:46,598
YOU'RE MOVING HOME.
