SO, I MEAN,
ARE YOU INTO HER OR WHAT?

179
00:06:30,224 --> 00:06:31,642
I WOULDN'T MIND GETTING
TO KNOW HER BETTER.

180
00:06:31,725 --> 00:06:32,726
ALL RIGHT,
THEN GO FOR IT!

181
00:06:32,809 --> 00:06:35,020
I TOOK A CHANCE
WITH ALLI.

182
00:06:35,103 --> 00:06:36,355
I DON'T NOW IF I'M INTO
TAKING CHANCES

183
00:06:36,438 --> 00:06:38,023
WITH GIRLS ANY MORE.

184
00:06:38,106 --> 00:06:39,316
LOOK, SERIOUSLY, BRO,

185
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:42,444
AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED,
YOU'RE A DUDE.

186
00:06:42,528 --> 00:06:43,820
ALL RIGHT? SO MAKE A MOVE
AND BEFORE YOU KNOW IT

187
00:06:43,904 --> 00:06:45,781
IT'S GONNA BE ME, YOU,
KATIE AND ALLI

188
00:06:45,864 --> 00:06:48,283
ALL HANGING OUT
DOUBLE-DATE STYLE.

189
00:06:48,367 --> 00:06:50,911
MAYBE I'LL JUST BE
UP FRONT

190
00:06:50,994 --> 00:06:53,580
ABOUT WHAT LIES BENEATH
AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS.

191
00:06:53,664 --> 00:06:56,166
GOTTA SET THE TABLE
BEFORE YOU EAT, RIGHT?

192
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:58,335
OKAY, WHO TEACHES YOU
TO SAY THESE THINGS?

193
00:06:58,418 --> 00:06:59,920
IT'S ALL ME.

194
00:07:04,967 --> 00:07:06,635
P.A. ANNOUCEMENT:

THANK YOU.

198
00:07:39,793 --> 00:07:40,919
CAN I HELP YOU?

199
00:07:41,003 --> 00:07:41,920
YES.

200
00:07:42,004 --> 00:07:44,590
I'M STUDYING YOU.
I WANT TO BE YOU.

201
00:07:44,673 --> 00:07:46,133
OKAY...

202
00:07:46,216 --> 00:07:47,843
BUT I'M TAKEN BY ME.

203
00:07:47,926 --> 00:07:49,720
(SMALL LAUGH)
YOU'RE FUNNY.

204
00:07:49,803 --> 00:07:51,471
I DON'T WANT TO BE YOU,
EXACTLY.

205
00:07:51,555 --> 00:07:53,557
I WANT TO BE CLARA.

206
00:07:54,558 --> 00:07:55,475
AH.

207
00:07:55,559 --> 00:07:57,019
YOU'RE AUDITIONING
FOR ELI'S PLAY.

208
00:07:57,102 --> 00:07:58,353
CLARE,
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

209
00:07:58,437 --> 00:08:01,190
THERE'S A LITTLE VOICE INSIDE
MY HEAD SAYING, "BAD IDEA."

210
00:08:01,273 --> 00:08:03,442
YOU HEAR VOICES TOO?

211
00:08:05,861 --> 00:08:06,904
CLARE, PLEASE.

212
00:08:06,987 --> 00:08:09,531
YOU'RE MY ONLY HOPE
OF IMPRESSING ELI.

213
00:08:09,615 --> 00:08:10,699
I NEED THIS.

214
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:13,535
YOU LIKE HIM.

215
00:08:13,619 --> 00:08:14,912
YOU'RE NOT JEALOUS?

216
00:08:14,995 --> 00:08:18,081
NO, I HAVE A BOYFRIEND.
I'VE MOVED ON.

217
00:08:18,165 --> 00:08:21,001
I'D BE HAPPY
IF ELI DID TOO.

218
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:24,880
OKAY, I'LL HELP YOU.

219
00:08:24,963 --> 00:08:26,798
OH MY GOD, CLARE,
THANK YOU!

220
00:08:26,882 --> 00:08:29,843
JUST DON'T TELL ANYONE,
OKAY?

221
00:08:39,478 --> 00:08:41,897
HEY, AM I TOO LATE
TO VOLUNTEER?

222
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:42,898
UH, DEPENDS.

223
00:08:42,981 --> 00:08:44,691
DO YOU MIND WEARING
A SILLY T-SHIRT?

224
00:08:44,775 --> 00:08:46,401
UH, IS THIS
THE BIGGEST SIZE?

225
00:08:46,485 --> 00:08:48,111
THE GUYS WANT THEM
FORM FITTING.

226
00:08:48,195 --> 00:08:49,947
OH, OH, OKAY.
NOT A PROBLEM.

227
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:52,115
GREAT, I'LL PAIR YOU UP
WITH ONE OF THE GIRLS.

228
00:08:52,199 --> 00:08:53,200
HOW ABOUT YOU?

229
00:08:54,493 --> 00:08:55,494
ME? SURE.

230
00:08:57,704 --> 00:09:00,123
WARNING YOU IN ADVANCE,
YOU MAY BE UPSTAGED.

231
00:09:00,207 --> 00:09:01,291
I DO A MEAN ZOOLANDER.

232
00:09:01,375 --> 00:09:04,545
OH YEAH?
LET'S SEE YOUR "BLUE STEEL".

233
00:09:05,546 --> 00:09:06,630
BOTH:
(LAUGHING)

234
00:09:10,509 --> 00:09:13,011
YOU KNOW I'M TRANS,
RIGHT?

235
00:09:13,095 --> 00:09:16,223
YEAH, I KNOW.
DID I DO SOMETHING WRONG?

236
00:09:16,306 --> 00:09:17,516
NO,
IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL.

237
00:09:17,599 --> 00:09:19,184
I WAS JUST MAKING SURE.

238
00:09:19,268 --> 00:09:20,519
I GUESS I WAS JUST
THINKING OF YOU

239
00:09:20,602 --> 00:09:23,605
AS ONE OF THE GUYS.

240
00:09:30,612 --> 00:09:31,655
HOLLY J:
DO YOU HAVE NEWS?

241
00:09:31,738 --> 00:09:33,657
DOCTOR MITCH:
I DO.

242
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:36,159
YOUR FATHER, MOTHER AND SISTER
ARE ALL TYPE AB,

243
00:09:36,243 --> 00:09:37,911
BUT YOU'RE TYPE A.

244
00:09:38,912 --> 00:09:41,164
SO THEY CAN'T GIVE ME
A KIDNEY?

245
00:09:41,248 --> 00:09:43,000
WAIT, HOW CAN I HAVE
A DIFFERENT BLOOD TYPE?

246
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:45,669
WELL, IT'S POSSIBLE,
BUT IT'S HIGHLY UNLIKELY.

247
00:09:45,752 --> 00:09:46,837
I'M GONNA RUN
THE TESTS AGAIN.

248
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:49,548
THERE MIGHT HAVE BEEN
AN ERROR AT THE LAB.

249
00:09:51,884 --> 00:09:53,886
SWEETIE,
WE'LL FIND SOMEONE.

250
00:09:53,969 --> 00:09:55,512
I KNOW.

251
00:09:55,596 --> 00:09:57,306
I HOPE.

252
00:09:57,389 --> 00:09:59,474
YOU DON'T THINK IT'S WEIRD
ABOUT THE BLOOD TYPES?

253
00:09:59,558 --> 00:10:00,475
I NEVER GOT
HOW THAT WORKS,

254
00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:03,061
EVEN BACK IN
GRADE TEN BIOLOGY.

255
00:10:03,145 --> 00:10:05,147
BUT YOU HAVE
ALWAYS BEEN MORE TYPE A

256
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:06,690
THAN THE REST OF US.

257
00:10:06,773 --> 00:10:09,151
IT'S A BLESSING
AND A CURSE.

258
00:10:09,234 --> 00:10:10,819
WE'LL BROADEN OUR SEARCH -

259
00:10:10,903 --> 00:10:13,238
AUNTS, UNCLES, COUSINS.

260
00:10:13,322 --> 00:10:15,949
SURE.
SOMEONE'LL BE A MATCH.

261
00:10:17,201 --> 00:10:20,287
'CAUSE WE'RE ALL FAMILY,
RIGHT?

262
00:10:35,844 --> 00:10:36,845
HELLO, CLARE.

263
00:10:36,929 --> 00:10:38,013
ALREADY RETURNING
MY STUFF?

264
00:10:38,096 --> 00:10:38,680
YUP.

265
00:10:38,764 --> 00:10:41,642
I STAYED UP ALL NIGHT
READING CLARE'S FAVOURITES.

266
00:10:41,725 --> 00:10:44,269
WAIT, YOU READ ALL
MY TOP HEMINGWAYS?

267
00:10:44,353 --> 00:10:48,023
EVERY WORD.
NOW AS WE DISCUSSED BEFORE,

268
00:10:48,106 --> 00:10:49,983
CAN I BORROW
SOME OF YOUR CLOTHES?

269
00:10:50,067 --> 00:10:51,068
NOT SO FAST.

270
00:10:52,528 --> 00:10:54,738
I WILL HELP YOU
GET THIS PART,

271
00:10:54,821 --> 00:10:56,240
BUT I NEED SOMETHING
IN RETURN.

272
00:10:56,323 --> 00:10:57,824
I'LL KNIT YOU A SWEATER,
BUY YOU A MONKEY,

273
00:10:57,908 --> 00:11:00,160
FOOT MASSAGE -
ANYTHING!

274
00:11:00,244 --> 00:11:03,497
ONLY THIS:
IF YOU DO GET THE PART,

275
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:07,167
TRY TO MAKE CLARA
A BIT MORE SYMPATHETIC.

276
00:11:07,251 --> 00:11:09,211
I'M CONCERNED WITH ELI'S
PORTRAYL OF ME.

277
00:11:09,294 --> 00:11:10,587
DEAL.

278
00:11:10,671 --> 00:11:13,257
HOLLY J:
FIONA, IF YOU WEREN'T CUT FROM
THE SAME CLOTH AS YOUR FAMILY,

279
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:14,758
YOU'D KNOW IT, RIGHT?

280
00:11:14,842 --> 00:11:15,759
FIONA:
WELL, IT'S HARD TO SAY.

281
00:11:15,843 --> 00:11:16,802
I MEAN, I'M A TWIN,

282
00:11:16,885 --> 00:11:18,887
SO THERE'S A MALE COPY OF ME
OUT THERE

283
00:11:18,971 --> 00:11:21,890
AND SOMETIMES I THINK MY MOM
AND I SHARE THE SAME BRAIN.

284
00:11:21,974 --> 00:11:24,268
WAIT, IS THIS ABOUT
THE BLOOD TESTS?

285
00:11:24,351 --> 00:11:25,269
HOLLY J:
I LOOKED IT UP.

286
00:11:25,352 --> 00:11:26,645
IT IS REALLY WEIRD
THAT NOBODY IN MY FAMILY

287
00:11:26,728 --> 00:11:27,896
IS A BLOOD-TYPE MATCH.

288
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:29,106
FIONA:
WEIRD AS IN IMPOSSIBLE?

289
00:11:29,189 --> 00:11:31,066
SUPER, SUPER UNLIKELY.

290
00:11:32,067 --> 00:11:33,569
WELL,
SINCE IT'S COME TO THIS,

291
00:11:33,652 --> 00:11:34,570
I WANNA HELP.

292
00:11:34,653 --> 00:11:36,655
I WANNA TAKE THE TEST,
FIND OUT MY BLOOD TYPE.

293
00:11:36,738 --> 00:11:37,656
THERE'S MORE TO IT
THAN THAT.

294
00:11:37,739 --> 00:11:39,241
THERE'S HUMAN LEUKOCYTE
ANTIGENS-

295
00:11:39,324 --> 00:11:41,451
YOU'RE NOT GONNA TALK ME
OUT OF IT.

296
00:11:41,535 --> 00:11:42,703
YOU'RE LIKE A SISTER TO ME,
HOLLY J.

297
00:11:42,786 --> 00:11:44,663
YOU KNOW THAT.

298
00:11:44,746 --> 00:11:46,248
MORE THAN MY SISTER
EVER WAS.

299
00:11:46,331 --> 00:11:48,584
YOU AND HEATHER
ARE SIX YEARS APART.

300
00:11:48,667 --> 00:11:50,294
I DUG THIS OUT
OF MY BASEMENT.

301
00:11:50,377 --> 00:11:52,129
I'VE SEEN PICTURES
OF TODDLER ME,

302
00:11:52,212 --> 00:11:53,422
BUT I DON'T REMEMBER
EVER SEEING

303
00:11:53,505 --> 00:11:55,507
ANY BABY-ME PICTURES.

304
00:11:55,591 --> 00:11:56,884
I'VE NEVER PAID MUCH ATTENTION
TO THE DATES,

305
00:11:56,967 --> 00:11:58,844
BUT LOOK, 1993.

306
00:11:58,927 --> 00:12:00,637
OH, THAT WAS
MY FIRST CHRISTMAS.

307
00:12:00,721 --> 00:12:01,638
WE WERE IN BRUSSELS.

308
00:12:01,722 --> 00:12:03,098
MY MOM TOOK LIKE
A THOUSAND PICTURES

309
00:12:03,182 --> 00:12:04,933
OF DECLAN AND ME SURROUNDED
BY BABY GIFTS.

310
00:12:05,017 --> 00:12:06,226
RIGHT, IT WAS MY FIRST
CHRISTMAS TOO,

311
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:09,563
SO I SHOULD BE IN
EVERY PHOTO IN HERE.

312
00:12:10,564 --> 00:12:11,940
IS THAT HEATHER?

313
00:12:12,024 --> 00:12:13,442
PRE-NOSEJOB.

314
00:12:13,525 --> 00:12:15,319
THERE'S MY MOM, DAD...

315
00:12:15,402 --> 00:12:16,320

316
00:12:16,403 --> 00:12:17,779
EVEN HEATHER'S PET TURTLE.

317
00:12:17,863 --> 00:12:18,906
WHERE AM I?

318
00:12:19,907 --> 00:12:21,658
NAPPING?

319
00:12:21,742 --> 00:12:24,453
FIONA, I WASN'T THERE.

320
00:12:24,536 --> 00:12:26,705
WHY WASN'T I THERE?!

321
00:12:31,001 --> 00:12:32,085
ELI:
YOU'RE TEARING ME APART,
CLARA.

322
00:12:32,169 --> 00:12:33,086
JUST TELL ME WHAT YOU WANT.

323
00:12:33,170 --> 00:12:35,631
SADIE:
I'LL SHOW YOU,
BUT NOT WITH WORDS.

324
00:12:35,714 --> 00:12:37,299
ELI:
AND SCENE.

325
00:12:37,382 --> 00:12:38,717
THANK YOU.

326
00:12:42,387 --> 00:12:45,724

EVEN COME CLOSE.

I'M HERE TO AUDITION,

333
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:05,744
BUT BEFORE YOU GET
TOO EXCITED

334
00:13:05,827 --> 00:13:07,829
KNOW THAT WE CAN'T
BE TOGETHER

335
00:13:07,913 --> 00:13:08,830
BECAUSE ALL WE WOULD DO

336
00:13:08,914 --> 00:13:10,499
IS SPIRAL INTO ANOTHER
EPIC VORTEX

337
00:13:10,582 --> 00:13:14,419
WHICH ENDS WITH YOU CRASHING
A HEARSE INTO A WALL!

338

WE ARE ALL
A LOST GENERATION.

339
