1
00:00:01,668 --> 00:00:04,505
(LOW HUM OF CHATTER)

2
00:00:05,923 --> 00:00:06,924
(GIGGLES)

3
00:00:10,844 --> 00:00:12,346
THAT LOOKS AWKWARD.

4
00:00:15,432 --> 00:00:18,101
THIS IS LOOKING GOOD,
GUYS.

5
00:00:18,185 --> 00:00:19,686
(GIGGLES)
EVERYTHING OKAY?

6
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:21,855
UH, YEAH.
WHY WOULDN'T IT BE?

7
00:00:24,608 --> 00:00:26,401
AND COMPLETE!

8
00:00:26,485 --> 00:00:28,111
(CLAPS)
GREAT ICE-BREAKER, EVERYONE!

9
00:00:28,195 --> 00:00:29,196
(APPLAUSE)

10
00:00:32,908 --> 00:00:35,077
SO TODAY IS ABOUT
OVERCOMING PROBLEMS

11
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:36,828
BY WORKING TOGETHER,

12
00:00:36,912 --> 00:00:37,829
GAINING PERSPECTIVE,

13
00:00:37,913 --> 00:00:39,790
AND PUTTING YOURSELF
INTO SOMEONE ELSE'S SHOES.

14
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:42,292
SO YOU HAVE ABOUT A HALF AN HOUR
TO PREPARE YOUR PROPOSALS,

15
00:00:42,376 --> 00:00:44,002
AND THEN WE'LL GET STARTED,
OKAY?

16
00:00:44,086 --> 00:00:45,838
(APPLAUSE)
ALL RIGHT.

17
00:00:50,676 --> 00:00:51,718
OFF TO A GOOD START!

18
00:00:51,802 --> 00:00:52,928
YEAH, I WAS THINKING
THE SAME THING!

19
00:00:54,221 --> 00:00:56,807
JACINTA:
JUST LIKE OLD TIMES.
RIGHT, DAVE?

20
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:59,309
ALLI:
AH! DO YOU GUYS KNOW
EACH OTHER?

21
00:00:59,393 --> 00:01:00,561
INTIMATELY.

22
00:01:00,644 --> 00:01:02,104
UH, NO. ACQUAINTANCES.

23
00:01:02,187 --> 00:01:04,106
SHE'S FROM SUMMER CAMP.

24
00:01:05,482 --> 00:01:08,151
THIS IS MY GIRLFRIEND,
ALLI.

25
00:01:08,235 --> 00:01:10,863
SO THAT'S WHY YOU HAVEN'T
BEEN CALLING ME BACK.

26
00:01:10,946 --> 00:01:12,030
I'M JACINTA.

27
00:01:12,114 --> 00:01:13,657
I HAVE A FEELING
YOU'VE HEARD NOTHING ABOUT ME.

28
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:16,577
OKAY, IGNORE HER,
SHE'S LOCA.

29
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:18,287
YOU'LL HOLD MY HAND,
BUT YOU WON'T TALK TO ME?

30
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:20,664
CAN WE TALK ALONE?

31
00:01:20,747 --> 00:01:23,166
YEAH, I DON'T THINK
THAT I WANT TO.

32
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:25,252
ALLI, YOU HAVE
TO TRUST ME.

00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:29,274
(SIGHS) IS IT TOO LATE
TO BACK OUT?

55
00:02:29,358 --> 00:02:30,901
SHE SENT YOU SECRET
LOVE NOTES.

56
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:32,110
YOU CAN'T JUST
NOT SHOW UP.

57
00:02:32,194 --> 00:02:33,111
WELL,
IT'S A DOUBLE DATE,

58
00:02:33,195 --> 00:02:36,031
SO IT'S NOT LIKE
SHE'LL BE LEFT ALONE.

59
00:02:36,114 --> 00:02:37,533
AND ISN'T DATING
A GRADE NINE WEIRD?

60
00:02:37,616 --> 00:02:38,742
WHAT HAVE YOU
GOT TO LOSE?

61
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:41,578
OH, MY DIGNITY.
LIKE WITH BIANCA,

62
00:02:41,662 --> 00:02:44,164

(SIGHS)

64
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,752
WELL, DOES THIS GIRL
KNOW YOU'RE TRANS?

65
00:02:48,836 --> 00:02:49,545
APPARENTLY.

66
00:02:49,628 --> 00:02:51,755
SEE? YOU HAVE NOTHING
TO WORRY ABOUT.

67
00:02:51,839 --> 00:02:52,756
JUST HAVE FUN.

68
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:56,134
IT IS NICE TO BE
PURSUED FOR ONCE.

69
00:02:56,218 --> 00:02:58,095
LIKE YOU SAID,
I'M JUST GONNA GO HAVE FUN,

70
00:02:58,178 --> 00:03:01,056
AND MAYBE...
I MEET SOMEONE NEW.

71
00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:03,725
IN A SEXY DENIM JACKET
PERHAPS?

72
00:03:04,726 --> 00:03:06,103
GET THAT OUT OF MY FACE!

73
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:08,146
COME ON, WEAR IT!

74
00:03:10,148 --> 00:03:11,525
THE GIRL'S STALKING ME.

75
00:03:11,608 --> 00:03:13,652
STALKING YOU?
HOW DOES SHE EVEN KNOW YOU?

76
00:03:13,735 --> 00:03:15,571
LOOK, I DIDN'T WANNA
DRAG YOU INTO THIS,

77
00:03:15,654 --> 00:03:16,947
BUT WE COMMITTED TO BEING
100% HONEST.

78
00:03:19,366 --> 00:03:20,284
SHE'S THE GIRL
I HAD A THING WITH

79
00:03:20,367 --> 00:03:21,702
LAST SUMMER.

80
00:03:25,122 --> 00:03:26,540
WELL, DID YOU KNOW
SHE WAS COMING?

81
00:03:26,623 --> 00:03:28,917
NO. NO. SHE MUST HAVE FOUND OUT
THAT MODEL U.N. WAS AT DEGRASSI

82
00:03:29,001 --> 00:03:30,127
AND SIGNED UP.

83
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:31,670
I KNEW SOMETHING WAS OFF
WHEN I MET HER OUTSIDE.

84
00:03:31,753 --> 00:03:32,671
SHE STILL LIKES YOU.

85
00:03:32,754 --> 00:03:33,672
NO. NO, SHE DOESN'T.

86
00:03:33,755 --> 00:03:34,673
THIS IS EXACTLY
WHAT I WAS WORRIED ABOUT.

87
00:03:34,756 --> 00:03:35,632
I SHOULDN'T HAVE TOLD YOU.

88
00:03:35,716 --> 00:03:38,802
NO, I'M GLAD YOU DID.

89
00:03:38,886 --> 00:03:41,263
CAN I JUST GO BACK
INSIDE?
CAN YOU LOOK AT ME?

90
00:03:41,346 --> 00:03:44,349
'CAUSE I JUST NEED TO KNOW
THAT YOU'RE GONNA BE OKAY;

91
00:03:44,433 --> 00:03:45,350
THAT WE'LL BE OKAY.

92
00:03:45,434 --> 00:03:46,351
WHAT DO YOU WANT ME
TO SAY, DAVE?

93
00:03:46,435 --> 00:03:48,020
I WAS LOOKING FORWARD
TO TODAY.

94
00:03:48,103 --> 00:03:49,813
NOW I CAN'T WAIT FOR IT
TO BE OVER.

95
00:03:49,897 --> 00:03:52,649
SO, IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME,
I'M JUST GONNA GO INSIDE

96
00:03:52,733 --> 00:03:55,402
AND YOU KNOW,
HOST YOUR EX-BOOTY CALL.

97
00:04:00,324 --> 00:04:01,325

I HAVE SOMETHING TO CONFESS.

99
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:11,335
I PUT GUM IN YOUR HAIR
YESTERDAY.

100
00:04:11,418 --> 00:04:13,462
I KNOW.
JUST FORGET ABOUT IT.

101
00:04:13,545 --> 00:04:16,340
LET'S GET THROUGH THE DAY
AND BANK OUR EXTRA CREDIT.

102
00:04:16,423 --> 00:04:18,383
OKAY. I WORKED ON SOME STUFF
FOR US LAST NIGHT.

103
00:04:18,467 --> 00:04:21,178
MEET ME IN THE RESOURCE CENTRE
TO GO OVER IT?

104
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:22,346
SURE.

105
00:04:22,429 --> 00:04:23,347
GO USA!

106
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:24,431
GO USA!

107
00:04:24,515 --> 00:04:26,391
AGGGHHH!
(LAUGHS)

108
00:04:26,475 --> 00:04:27,976
AGH.
IT'S WORSE THAN I THOUGHT.

109
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:29,853
HE'S PRACTICALLY
IN LOVE WITH ME.

110
00:04:29,937 --> 00:04:31,980
HE WANTED TO HOLD
MY HAND EARLIER.

111
00:04:32,064 --> 00:04:33,023
MARISOL, THAT WAS A PART
OF THE GAME.

112
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:34,024
IT DOESN'T MATTER!

113
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:36,318
THERE'S MANY OTHER HANDS
HE COULD HAVE HELD.

114
00:04:36,401 --> 00:04:37,611
THIS GIRL FROM BARDELL

115
00:04:37,694 --> 00:04:39,947
ASKED ME
IF MO WAS MY BOYFRIEND.

116
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:41,698
BOY-FRIEND.

117
00:04:41,782 --> 00:04:43,450
I GUESS YOU AND MO
JUST HAVE NATURAL CHEMISTRY.

118
00:04:43,534 --> 00:04:45,035
NO, WE DO NOT.

119
00:04:45,118 --> 00:04:46,370
THIS IS HUMILIATING.

120
00:04:46,453 --> 00:04:49,206
PEOPLE NEED TO STOP THINKING
WE'RE TOGETHER.

121
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:52,251
HOW DO I KILL
THIS CRUSH?

122
00:04:52,334 --> 00:04:54,169
JUST BE YOURSELF.

123
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:56,421
I HAVE TO BE HONEST,

124
00:04:56,505 --> 00:04:59,216
TELL HIM IT'S NEVER
GOING TO HAPPEN.

125
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:01,468
GOOD LUCK WITH THAT.

126
00:05:06,974 --> 00:05:09,893
HEY, SORRY I WAS SO RUDE
EARLIER.

127
00:05:09,977 --> 00:05:12,229
YOU PRACTICALLY FELT ME UP
IN FRONT OF YOUR GIRLFRIEND.

128
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:13,564
THOUGHT WE WERE OFF
TO A PRETTY GOOD START.

129
00:05:13,647 --> 00:05:15,232
YEAH. WELL, THERE'S STILL TIME
BEFORE WE START.

130
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:16,233
YOU WANNA GET OUTTA HERE?

131
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:18,110
WHAT'S YOUR GIRLFRIEND
GONNA THINK ABOUT THAT?

132
00:05:18,193 --> 00:05:21,154
SHE DOESN'T HAVE TO KNOW.

133
00:05:21,238 --> 00:05:23,156
SEE YOU AT THE SIDE DOOR
IN FIVE?

134
00:05:34,001 --> 00:05:35,794
LOOK, SINCE WE HAVE
TO WORK TOGETHER ALL DAY,

135
00:05:35,878 --> 00:05:39,089

I MEAN, AT FIRST,
I WAS EMBARRASSED

352
00:14:56,939 --> 00:14:58,565
THAT YOU HAVE A CRUSH
ON ME.

353
00:14:58,649 --> 00:15:01,318
BUT NOW I'M THINK
IT'S KIND OF A GOOD THING.

354
00:15:01,401 --> 00:15:03,028
I DON'T HAVE A CRUSH
ON YOU.

355
00:15:03,111 --> 00:15:04,613
IT'S OKAY,
YOU CAN ADMIT IT.

356
00:15:04,696 --> 00:15:06,823
IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL.

357
00:15:06,907 --> 00:15:08,408
IT'S ACTUALLY REALLY CUTE.

358
00:15:08,492 --> 00:15:11,119
I WAS BEING NICE
AND POLITE.

359
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,205
DON'T GET ME WRONG,
I'M FLATTERED-

360
00:15:13,288 --> 00:15:14,623
SCREW YOU.

361
00:15:17,125 --> 00:15:19,294
UH, U.S. DELEGATE,

(BREATHING HARD)

366
00:16:05,007 --> 00:16:06,425
NOT AGAIN.

367
00:16:06,508 --> 00:16:07,676
WAIT UP.

368
00:16:12,222 --> 00:16:14,391
UM, I'LL LET YOU
TWO TALK.

369
00:16:17,769 --> 00:16:18,896
I KNOW THIS IS WEIRD,

370
00:16:18,979 --> 00:16:20,731
BUT I'VE BEEN IN
YOUR SHOES BEFORE.

371
00:16:20,814 --> 00:16:22,441
YEAH, RIGHT.

372
00:16:22,524 --> 00:16:25,027
I'M SERIOUS.
MAYBE WORSE, EVEN.

373
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:27,696
I'M NOT SURE
THAT'S POSSIBLE.

374
00:16:28,697 --> 00:16:30,616
THE FIRST GIRL I TRIED TO DATE
AT DEGRASSI

375
00:16:30,699 --> 00:16:32,326
RIPPED MY SHIRT OPEN
IN THE HALLWAY,

376
00:16:32,409 --> 00:16:34,536
THEN HAD HER FRIENDS
THROW ME INTO A DOOR.

377
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:35,537
MY BROTHER GOT SUSPENDED

378
00:16:35,621 --> 00:16:38,123
FOR THROWING SOMEONE
INTO A DOOR.

379
00:16:38,207 --> 00:16:40,083
OWEN OR FITZ?

380
00:16:42,544 --> 00:16:44,171
OWEN.

381
00:16:44,254 --> 00:16:46,798
(SIGHS) THAT WAS YOU.

382
00:16:46,882 --> 00:16:47,799
I'M SO SORRY.

383
00:16:47,883 --> 00:16:49,009
IT'S OKAY.

384
00:16:50,010 --> 00:16:52,471
THE SECOND GIRL LOVED
TO MAKE OUT WITH ME

385
00:16:52,554 --> 00:16:54,389
ONLY AFTER DRINKING
A BOTTLE OF CHAMPAGNE.

386
00:16:54,473 --> 00:16:56,058
SOUNDS TERRIBLE.

387
00:16:57,059 --> 00:16:59,102
I DIDN'T EVEN WANNA
GO ON A DATE.

388
00:16:59,186 --> 00:17:00,354
TORI FORCED ME.

389
00:17:00,437 --> 00:17:02,314
SHE SAID SHE WANTED ME
TO BE HAPPY,

390
00:17:02,397 --> 00:17:03,315
OR WHATEVER.

391
00:17:03,398 --> 00:17:04,399
WELL,
DATING IN HIGH SCHOOL

392
00:17:04,483 --> 00:17:06,485
ISN'T ALWAYS THE BEST ROUTE
TO HAPPINESS.

393
00:17:06,568 --> 00:17:08,237
HOW DID YOU EVER
WANT TO DATE AGAIN

394
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:09,738
AFTER ALL THOSE DISASTERS?

395
00:17:09,821 --> 00:17:11,240
I DIDN'T.

396
00:17:12,241 --> 00:17:15,160
BUT YOU'VE GOTTA
STAY OPEN TO STUFF.

397
00:17:15,244 --> 00:17:18,163
YOU NEVER KNOW
WHEN YOU'LL GET A SMALL WIN.

398
00:17:18,247 --> 00:17:22,042
P.S. I DIDN'T THINK
YOU WERE GAY.

399
00:17:22,125 --> 00:17:24,419
TORI HAS TERRIBLE GAYDAR.

400
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:26,588

406
00:17:47,276 --> 00:17:49,695
SHE WALKED
INTO THE STREET.

407
00:17:49,778 --> 00:17:51,488
SHE DIDN'T LOOK.

408
00:17:52,489 --> 00:17:54,241
THEY TOLD ME
WHAT HAPPENED.

409
00:17:54,324 --> 00:17:56,368
IT WAS JUST AN ACCIDENT.

410
00:17:56,451 --> 00:17:59,162
