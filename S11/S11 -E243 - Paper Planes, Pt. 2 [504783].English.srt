00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:06,460
ANYA:
OKAY, LAST NIGHT WAS BAD.

41
00:02:06,543 --> 00:02:07,711
I DIDN'T LIKE US
FIGHTING LIKE THAT,

42
00:02:07,794 --> 00:02:09,505
BUT YOU SAID
SOME MEAN THINGS

43
00:02:09,588 --> 00:02:11,256
AND I DIDN'T KNOW
WHAT TO DO.

44
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:12,257
SO YOU GOT ALL COKED UP

45
00:02:12,341 --> 00:02:13,258
AND GRINDED
WITH ANOTHER DUDE

46
00:02:13,342 --> 00:02:14,468
IN FRONT OF MY FACE?

47
00:02:14,551 --> 00:02:16,845
SORRY. I WASN'T MYSELF
LAST NIGHT.

48
00:02:16,929 --> 00:02:18,639
YEAH,
TELL ME ABOUT IT.

49
00:02:18,722 --> 00:02:20,015
YOU'RE NOT THE SWEET,
CUTE GIRL

50
00:02:20,098 --> 00:02:23,060
I THOUGHT YOU WERE.

51
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:25,145
ARE WE BREAKING UP?

52
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:32,694

WHEN YOU GET BACK.

00:02:34,863 --> 00:02:35,864

58
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:59,054
WERE YOU OUT AGAIN
LAST NIGHT?

59
00:02:59,137 --> 00:03:00,138
UM, NO.

60
00:03:01,682 --> 00:03:03,141
I WAS PREPPING
FOR MY INTERVIEW.

61
00:03:03,225 --> 00:03:04,977
GOOD. THOSE THINGS
CAN BE KILLER.

62
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:06,436
MY YALE INTERVIEW WAS BY FAR

63
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,480
THE HARDEST 45 MINUTES
OF MY LIFE.

64
00:03:08,564 --> 00:03:10,190
I PERSPIRED.

65
00:03:10,274 --> 00:03:11,441
YOU MEAN,
YOU DON'T JUST SHOW UP

66
00:03:11,525 --> 00:03:12,776
AND GO, "HERE I AM!

67
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:14,778
CHECKED OUT YOUR WEBSITE,
LOVE YOUR SCHOOL!"

68
00:03:14,862 --> 00:03:16,071
NOT AT ALL.
(LAUGHS)

69
00:03:16,154 --> 00:03:17,489
OKAY.

70
00:03:17,573 --> 00:03:20,117

EVERY UNIVERSITY PREP BOOK

71
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,994
IN EXISTENCE,

72
00:03:22,077 --> 00:03:23,704
WOULD YOU MIND
COACHING ME?

73
00:03:23,787 --> 00:03:25,747
OF COURSE.

74
00:03:25,831 --> 00:03:26,874

BOTH:

76
00:03:28,792 --> 00:03:30,752
SIMPSON: (OVER PA)
A MALE WAS SEEN IN THE GIRLS'
CHANGE ROOM YESTERDAY.

77
00:03:30,836 --> 00:03:33,046
POLICE ARE INVESTIGATING
THE INCIDENT...

78
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:34,047
IT'S PROBABLY THE PERV

79
00:03:34,131 --> 00:03:35,799
WHO'S BEEN STEALING
GIRLS' UNDERWEAR.

80
00:03:35,883 --> 00:03:36,800
GROSS!

81
00:03:36,884 --> 00:03:37,968
I HOPE THEY CATCH
THE CREEP.

82
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:39,469
(LAUGHS) IMAGINE
IT'S SOME FLASHER?!

83
00:03:39,553 --> 00:03:40,470
BOTH:
(CHUCKLE)

84
00:03:40,554 --> 00:03:42,556
EVEN WORSE?
IT COULD BE A STUDENT.

85
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:44,766
IT COULD BE ANYONE
IN THE SCHOOL.

86
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:47,477
HEY.
LOOK, I DON'T WANT
TO TALK TO YOU.

87
00:03:47,561 --> 00:03:48,478
YOU THINK IT WAS ME?

88
00:03:48,562 --> 00:03:52,191
OKAY, WHO ELSE IS
SNEAKING AROUND STEALING...

89
00:03:52,274 --> 00:03:53,692
(WHISPERS) STEALING
GIRLS' UNDERWEAR?

90
00:03:53,775 --> 00:03:54,693
I HAVE AN ALIBI.

91
00:03:54,776 --> 00:03:55,903
I WAS IN THE COMPUTER LAB
AFTER SCHOOL,

92
00:03:55,986 --> 00:03:57,946
WORKING ON THE APP,
OKAY?

93
00:03:58,030 --> 00:03:59,865
ASK MR. SIMPSON,
CHECK MY LOGINS.

94
00:03:59,948 --> 00:04:01,408

CONNOR:

109

00:04:38,195 --> 00:04:40,489
CAN I GET YOU A COFFEE
OR A TEA?

116
00:04:40,572 --> 00:04:41,865
DON'T ASK
IF THEY WANT ANYTHING.

117
00:04:41,949 --> 00:04:42,866
I'M BEING POLITE!

118
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:44,243
YOU'LL BE IN THEIR OFFICE,
NOT A CAFE!

119
00:04:45,244 --> 00:04:46,203

120
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:47,829
OKAY
'KAY

121
00:04:47,913 --> 00:04:50,874
WHERE DO YOU SEE YOURSELF
IN TEN YEARS?

122
00:04:50,958 --> 00:04:52,042
JEEZ, I DON'T KNOW.

123
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:54,670
UM, I WANTED TO BE A VET,

124
00:04:54,753 --> 00:04:57,714
BUT THOSE PROGRAMS
ARE IMPOSSIBLE TO GET INTO

125
00:04:57,798 --> 00:04:59,716
WITH MY GPA.

126
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:03,720
I GAVE UP THAT DREAM,
SO...

127
00:05:03,804 --> 00:05:04,972
HAPPY?

128
00:05:05,055 --> 00:05:06,682
MAYBE YOU NEED
A CARD TO PLAY.

129
00:05:06,765 --> 00:05:08,725
SCHOOLS LOOK FOR ALL KINDS
OF DIVERSITY.

130
00:05:08,809 --> 00:05:09,893
TALK ABOUT MY DYSLEXIA?

131
00:05:09,977 --> 00:05:10,894
THAT'S REALLY GOOD!

132
00:05:10,978 --> 00:05:12,479
AND HOW I HELPED MY MOM
THROUGH CANCER.

133
00:05:12,563 --> 00:05:13,939
THAT'S AMAZING,
ANYA!

134
00:05:14,022 --> 00:05:16,233
SO DO YOU SEE YOURSELF
AS MORE OF A LEADER

135
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:17,234
OR A FOLLOWER?

136
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:18,360
FOLLOWER.

137
00:05:18,443 --> 00:05:20,237
BUT I'M TRYING TO LEAD MORE
IN MY OWN LIFE,

138
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,572
DO MY OWN THING,
YOU KNOW?

139
00:05:21,655 --> 00:05:23,365
IT'S IMPORTANT
TO HAVE A PATH.

140
00:05:23,448 --> 00:05:25,409
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO GET
OUT OF YOUR DEGREE?

141
00:05:25,492 --> 00:05:26,910
I WOULD LIKE TO HELP PEOPLE

142
00:05:26,994 --> 00:05:28,453
AND MAKE THE WORLD
A BETTER PLACE.

143
00:05:28,537 --> 00:05:31,290
YOU GOTTA THINK UNIVERSITY,
NOT MISS UNIVERSE PAGEANT.

144
00:05:31,373 --> 00:05:33,125
BE SPECIFIC.

145
00:05:33,208 --> 00:05:35,043
I LOVE BEING HANDS-ON,

146
00:05:36,044 --> 00:05:37,880
AND I LIKE WORKING

147
00:05:37,963 --> 00:05:40,299
OKAY, WELL, YOU'RE APPLYING
FOR A MINOR IN ENGLISH.

148
00:05:40,382 --> 00:05:42,843
WHAT'S YOUR FAVOURITE BOOK?

149
00:05:43,844 --> 00:05:44,928
A BOOK.

150
00:05:46,138 --> 00:05:47,389
ANY BOOK.

151
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:51,727
DO MAGAZINES COUNT?

152
00:05:53,103 --> 00:05:54,146
OKAY, WE ARE GOING

153
00:05:54,229 --> 00:05:56,190
TO THE NATIONAL APP
CHAMPIONSHIPS!

154
00:05:56,273 --> 00:05:57,191
I MUST BE DREAMING.

155
00:05:57,274 --> 00:05:58,609
YOU'RE NOT,
IT'S REAL!

156
00:05:58,692 --> 00:05:59,610
I'M GOING TO GO WORK OUT
BUGS IN THE CODE.

157
00:05:59,693 --> 00:06:00,611
I'LL SEE YOU GUYS LATER.

158
00:06:00,694 --> 00:06:03,113
OKAY, SEE YA LATER,
YOU ULTIMATE PROGRAMMER!

159
00:06:03,197 --> 00:06:05,449
HEY, CAN I SEE THAT
FOR A SECOND?

160
00:06:05,532 --> 00:06:06,533
UM...

161
00:06:12,331 --> 00:06:14,124
MY NANIMA KNIT THAT FOR ME.

162
00:06:14,208 --> 00:06:15,501
CUTE!

163
00:06:15,584 --> 00:06:17,252
BUT HOW DID IT
GET IN HERE?

164
00:06:17,336 --> 00:06:18,545
I LEFT IT IN THE LOCKER ROOM

165
00:06:18,629 --> 00:06:21,298
DURING THE BEACH VOLLEYBALL
THING.

166
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:23,050
THE GUY IN
THE LOCKER ROOM.

167
00:06:37,022 --> 00:06:38,273
FEELING READY?

168
00:06:38,357 --> 00:06:39,525
I THINK SO.

169
00:06:39,608 --> 00:06:41,443
YOU'LL DO GREAT.

170
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:46,406
CAN YOU COME TO THE INTERVIEW
WITH ME AND KEEP ME COMPANY?

171
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:47,449
LIKE THAT WON'T BE WEIRD?

172
00:06:47,533 --> 00:06:49,159
NO, IT WON'T BE WEIRD
AT ALL!

173
00:06:49,243 --> 00:06:50,160
HONEY!

174
00:06:50,244 --> 00:06:52,996
THEY NEED TO SEE HOW BRIGHT
AND INDEPENDENT YOU ARE.

175
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:56,792
YOU CAN DO THIS,
YOU SILLY GOOSE.

176
00:06:56,875 --> 00:07:00,838
(SNIFFLES) YEAH,
I DON'T THINK I CAN.

177
00:07:00,921 --> 00:07:02,840
I CAN'T HEAR YOU.

178
00:07:02,923 --> 00:07:03,966
(SIGHS)

179
00:07:05,717 --> 00:07:06,635
WHAT IS WRONG WITH ME,
MOM?

180
00:07:06,718 --> 00:07:08,554
I USED TO BE
SO CONFIDENT.

181
00:07:08,637 --> 00:07:10,013
NOTHING IS WRONG
WITH YOU.

182
00:07:10,097 --> 00:07:11,014
YOU CALLED THIS SCHOOL

183
00:07:11,098 --> 00:07:14,184
AND GOT THE INTERVIEW
ALL ON YOUR OWN!

184
00:07:14,268 --> 00:07:15,769
YOU CAN DO ANYTHING,

185
00:07:15,853 --> 00:07:18,021
AS LONG AS YOU WANT IT
BADLY ENOUGH.

186
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:20,440
OKAY.

187
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:22,776
OKAY. (SIGHS)

188
00:07:27,573 --> 00:07:28,699
(WAKING GROAN)

189
00:07:30,284 --> 00:07:32,619
OEUF-A-LA-COQ FOR BREAKFAST?

190
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:35,038
SOUNDS DELICIOUS!

191
00:07:35,122 --> 00:07:36,039
DON'T GET EXCITED.

192
00:07:36,123 --> 00:07:38,375
IT'S JUST
A SOFT-BOILED EGG.

193
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:40,961
HEY, SINCE WE'RE
BED-BUG FREE,

194
00:07:41,962 --> 00:07:43,881
HOW ABOUT WE CELEBRATE TONIGHT?

195
00:07:43,964 --> 00:07:45,174
JUST YOU AND ME,

196
00:07:45,257 --> 00:07:46,592
SOME CHEAP CHAMPAGNE?

197
00:07:47,593 --> 00:07:48,510
CHAMPAGNE.

198
00:07:48,594 --> 00:07:50,429
CHARLIE:
I KNOW YOU'RE UNDERAGE,

199
00:07:50,512 --> 00:07:52,764
BUT JUST A LITTLE SOMETHING
TO WET OUR LIPS.

200
00:07:52,848 --> 00:07:54,683
(SIGHS)

201
00:07:54,766 --> 00:07:56,560
CHARLIE:
YOU'VE NEVER TRIED IT.

202
00:07:57,561 --> 00:07:58,478
I'M SORRY,

203
00:07:58,562 --> 00:08:01,064
I ASSUMED WITH EUROPEAN CHATEAUX
AND ALL.

204
00:08:01,148 --> 00:08:02,649
OH, I'VE TRIED IT.

205
00:08:04,693 --> 00:08:06,028
IT'S JUST...

206
00:08:07,404 --> 00:08:09,448
I LIKE YOU SO MUCH.

207
00:08:10,449 --> 00:08:11,366
I FELL FOR YOU

208
00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:14,703
LIKE THE FIRST TIME
I SAW YOU.

209
00:08:15,704 --> 00:08:18,248
I JUST DON'T WANT TO
MESS IT UP.

210
00:08:18,332 --> 00:08:20,334
I'M FALLING FOR YOU, TOO...

211
00:08:21,335 --> 00:08:23,420
SO HARD IT'S CRAZY.

212
00:08:25,214 --> 00:08:26,965
BUT IF YOU WANNA
TAKE THINGS SLOW...

213
00:08:27,049 --> 00:08:29,885
CHARLIE,
I'M DONE WITH SLOW.

214
00:08:43,065 --> 00:08:45,651
(LOUD THUMP)

215
00:08:45,734 --> 00:08:47,152
HI, UH...

216
00:08:48,153 --> 00:08:49,321
UH, MY NAME'S ANYA MACPHERSON.

217
00:08:49,404 --> 00:08:50,864
I KNOW.

218
00:08:50,948 --> 00:08:53,033
COPY OF YOUR TRANSCRIPT?

219
00:08:53,116 --> 00:08:55,744
OH, UH, I EMAILED IT OVER
WITH MY APPLICATION.

220
00:08:55,827 --> 00:08:57,538
WE EXPECT YOU TO BRING ONE
WITH YOU.

221
00:08:58,664 --> 00:09:00,290
NOW, OFFICIALLY,
WE'RE ALL FILLED UP,

222
00:09:00,374 --> 00:09:02,876
SO I WOULDN'T GET
MY HOPES UP.

223
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:03,961
OKAY.

224
00:09:05,379 --> 00:09:06,964
I'LL GET YOUR TRANSCRIPT.

225
00:09:07,047 --> 00:09:08,799
DON'T TOUCH ANYTHING.

226
00:09:28,235 --> 00:09:29,236
(SIGHS)

227
00:09:30,821 --> 00:09:32,114
ANYA: (SPEAKING QUICKLY)
AND THEN I WENT THROUGH
THIS LARPING PHASE -

228
00:09:32,197 --> 00:09:33,448
LIVE ACTION ROLE-PLAYING.

229
00:09:33,532 --> 00:09:34,575
I LED MY FACTION TO VICTORY.

230
00:09:34,658 --> 00:09:37,870
IT ACTUALLY REQUIRES A LOT
OF LEADERSHIP AND IMAGINATION.

231
00:09:37,953 --> 00:09:38,871
ARE YOU OKAY?

232
00:09:38,954 --> 00:09:40,038
YEAH!
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.

233
00:09:40,122 --> 00:09:42,624
I TALK REALLY FAST
WHEN I'M NERVOUS.

234
00:09:42,708 --> 00:09:44,585
ACTUALLY, IT'S A BAD HABIT.
IT'S MY WORST QUALITY.

235
00:09:44,668 --> 00:09:47,087
IF YOU WERE TO ASK ME
WHAT MY WORST QUALITY IS...

236
00:09:47,171 --> 00:09:48,422
I WOULD SAY TALKS FAST
WHEN NERVOUS.

237
00:09:48,505 --> 00:09:50,424
(LAUGHS)
I'LL CROSS THAT OFF
MY LIST.

238
00:09:51,425 --> 00:09:53,135
YOU APPLIED FOR LIBERAL ARTS.

239
00:09:53,218 --> 00:09:55,012
WHERE DO YOU SEE THIS
TAKING YOU?

240
00:09:55,095 --> 00:09:57,514
UM... A PHD?

241
00:09:57,598 --> 00:09:59,224
I MEAN, MY PHD.
WITH A PERIOD,

242
00:09:59,308 --> 00:10:00,309
NOT A QUESTION MARK.

243
00:10:00,392 --> 00:10:03,645
I SEE MYSELF AS A PROFESSOR;
THAT'S MY PATH.

244
00:10:03,729 --> 00:10:06,315
WHAT CHALLENGES
HAVE YOU OVERCOME?

245
00:10:06,398 --> 00:10:09,276
UM...
I STRUGGLE WITH DYSLEXIA.

246
00:10:09,359 --> 00:10:11,403
AND YEAH, THAT'S TOUGH.

247
00:10:11,486 --> 00:10:14,573
I MEAN, PEOPLE JUDGE ME,
BUT I FIGHT THAT.

248
00:10:14,656 --> 00:10:16,074
I WANT TO BE AN EXAMPLE
FOR STUDENTS,

249
00:10:16,158 --> 00:10:17,159
A TRAILBLAZER.

250
00:10:18,577 --> 00:10:21,121
YOUR TRANSCRIPT IS AVERAGE,
AT BEST,

251
00:10:21,205 --> 00:10:23,040
ESPECIALLY THIS LAST TERM.

252
00:10:23,123 --> 00:10:25,167
WELL, I SPENT EVERY MINUTE
WITH MY MOM

253
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:26,919
WHEN SHE WAS BATTLING CANCER,

254
00:10:27,002 --> 00:10:29,213
AND I GOT TO LEARN A LOT ABOUT
THE MEDICAL COMMUNITY,

255
00:10:29,296 --> 00:10:32,257
AND THE EXPERIENCE
MADE ME STRONGER.

256
00:10:32,341 --> 00:10:34,760
OUTSIDE OF ACADEMIA,
ANY INTERESTS?

257
00:10:34,843 --> 00:10:36,178
I LIKE BOOKS.

258
00:10:36,261 --> 00:10:39,181
UH...THE TIPPING POINT?
EXCELLENT READ.

259
00:10:39,264 --> 00:10:41,517
I'D HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT.

260
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:44,102
SOUNDS LIKE YOU JUGGLE
A LOT.

261
00:10:44,186 --> 00:10:45,103
THAT'S ME.

262
00:10:45,187 --> 00:10:47,189
YOUR BASIC HIGH SCHOOL
OVER-ACHIEVER.

263
00:10:57,157 --> 00:10:59,535
I CAN'T TALK FOR LONG,
I HAVE TO WORK ON MY APP.

264
00:10:59,618 --> 00:11:00,619
CLOSE THE DOOR.

265
00:11:08,627 --> 00:11:10,879
STUDENTS HAVE BROUGHT
TO MY ATTENTION

266
00:11:10,963 --> 00:11:12,881
THAT YOU WERE IN THE GIRLS'
CHANGE ROOM.

267
00:11:12,965 --> 00:11:15,509
I WASN'T.
IT WAS SOMEONE ELSE.

268
00:11:15,592 --> 00:11:16,969
WE HAVE PROOF, CONNOR.

269
00:11:19,012 --> 00:11:20,639
ALLI RECOGNIZED HER CLOTHES
IN THE APP.

270
00:11:22,766 --> 00:11:23,725
OKAY, FINE.
IT WAS ME.

271
00:11:23,809 --> 00:11:25,519
BUT I DIDN'T MEAN
TO DO ANYTHING WRONG.

272
00:11:25,602 --> 00:11:27,437
CONNOR,
YOU PUSHED ALLI OVER.

273
00:11:27,521 --> 00:11:28,438
I DIDN'T!

274
00:11:28,522 --> 00:11:29,439
I WENT IN THE CHANGE ROOM

275
00:11:29,523 --> 00:11:30,440
TO TAKE PICTURES OF CLOTHES
FOR THE APP.

276
00:11:30,524 --> 00:11:32,526
SHE GOT IN MY WAY,
THAT'S IT.

277
00:11:36,655 --> 00:11:38,824
STUDENTS AND FACULTY HAVE BEEN
REPORTING MISSING UNDERWEAR.

278
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:43,912
I STOPPED, I PROMISE!

279
00:11:46,123 --> 00:11:47,457
SO IT WAS YOU?

280
00:11:49,334 --> 00:11:50,752
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
WHAT A CRISIS YOU'VE CAUSED

281
00:11:50,836 --> 00:11:51,837
FOR THIS SCHOOL?!

282
00:11:53,463 --> 00:11:55,007
I'M WORRIED ABOUT YOU,
CONNOR.

283
00:11:55,090 --> 00:11:56,008
AND I'VE BEEN SO BUSY

284
00:11:56,091 --> 00:11:57,050
THAT I HAVEN'T BEEN
AROUND LATELY,

285
00:11:57,134 --> 00:11:58,385
SO THIS IS PARTLY MY FAULT.

286
00:11:58,468 --> 00:11:59,636
CAN I GO WORK ON
MY APP NOW?

287
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:00,679
NO, NO, NO.
WE'RE NOT DONE TALKING.

288
00:12:00,762 --> 00:12:01,763
CAN I GO WORK ON
MY APP NOW!?

289
00:12:01,847 --> 00:12:03,974
CAN I GO WORK ON MY APP?!
CAN I GO WORK ON MY APP?!

290
00:12:04,057 --> 00:12:05,100
LET ME GO WORK ON MY APP!

291
00:12:05,184 --> 00:12:09,104
CALM DOWN, CALM DOWN.
CALM DOWN. RELAX.

292
00:12:09,188 --> 00:12:11,607
JUST TAKE A SEAT,
OKAY?

293
00:12:18,614 --> 00:12:20,699
I'M SORRY I YELLED.

294
00:12:27,247 --> 00:12:28,749
MS. DAWES:
THE MEISNER TECHNIQUE.

295
00:12:28,832 --> 00:12:32,711
KNOWN FOR IT'S INTENSE
REPETITION EXERCISES,

296
00:12:32,794 --> 00:12:35,964
AND THE GOAL OF THE EXERCISE
IS TRUTH.

297
00:12:37,633 --> 00:12:38,967
(WHISPERING)
SOMEONE'S GLOWING.

298
00:12:39,051 --> 00:12:40,677
(LAUGHS)

299
00:12:40,761 --> 00:12:42,804
(WHISPERING)
CHARLIE AND I TOOK
THE NEXT STEP.

300
00:12:42,888 --> 00:12:44,014
YOU FINALLY GOT
TO KNOW EACH OTHER?

301
00:12:44,097 --> 00:12:46,058
QUITE INTIMATELY.

302
00:12:47,267 --> 00:12:48,477
DETAILS, PLEASE.

303
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:49,561
AS IF.

304
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:54,149
I LIKE HER SO MUCH.

305
00:12:54,233 --> 00:12:55,984
SO WHY THE ANGST?

306
00:12:56,068 --> 00:12:58,487
SHE WANTS TO CELEBRATE BEING
BED-BUG FREE TONIGHT

307
00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:00,113
WITH SPARKLING WINE.

308
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:03,992
MINOR PROBLEM
FOR AN ALCOHOLIC.

309
00:13:04,076 --> 00:13:06,245
IT'S THE ONE THING
I DIDN'T TELL HER.

310
00:13:06,328 --> 00:13:10,123
I'M GOING AGAINST EVERYTHING
MY REHAB SPONSOR ADVISES.

311
00:13:10,207 --> 00:13:11,834
SO TELL HER.

312
00:13:11,917 --> 00:13:13,544
IF SHE LIKES YOU ENOUGH,
SHE'LL DEAL.

313
00:13:13,627 --> 00:13:16,004
NOT EVERYONE'S A DESPERATE
ROMANTIC LIKE YOU,

314
00:13:16,088 --> 00:13:19,091
MR. I-WRITE-PLAYS-
FOR-MY-EXES.

315
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:23,762
WHAT IF I SCARE HER OFF?

316
00:13:23,846 --> 00:13:27,349
YOU WANT ME TO WRITE
A PLAY FOR HER?

317
00:13:29,309 --> 00:13:30,310
(SIGHS)

318
00:13:31,603 --> 00:13:33,939
I DIDN'T THINK
IT WOULD HURT ANYONE.

319
00:13:34,022 --> 00:13:37,776
I MEAN, I LIKE LOOKING
AT GIRLS' UNDERWEAR.

320
00:13:38,777 --> 00:13:39,903
(SIGHS)
I KNOW IT'S WRONG.

321
00:13:39,987 --> 00:13:40,904
WELL, NO.

322
00:13:40,988 --> 00:13:42,573
YOU'RE EXPRESSING VERY NORMAL
TEEN HORMONES.

323
00:13:42,656 --> 00:13:43,574
SO THEN?

324
00:13:43,657 --> 00:13:45,909
BUT IN
AN UNACCEPTABLE MANNER.

325
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:48,036
THEN WHAT SHOULD I DO?

326
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:50,372
WELL, THERE'S LOTS OF WAYS
THAT TEEN BOYS

327
00:13:50,455 --> 00:13:52,082
DEAL WITH THEIR HORMONES.

328
00:13:52,165 --> 00:13:54,001
BUT IT'S HARDER FOR ME
BECAUSE I HAVE ASPERGERS?

329
00:13:54,084 --> 00:13:55,085
(SIGHS)

330
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:57,838
THAT'S WHY WE THINK
IT'D BE BEST

331
00:13:57,921 --> 00:14:00,299
IF YOU ENTERED AN ACADEMIC
BEHAVIORAL PROGRAM

332
00:14:00,382 --> 00:14:03,302
DURING YOUR SUSPENSION
FROM DEGRASSI.

333
00:14:03,385 --> 00:14:05,053
I'M BEING SUSPENDED?

334
00:14:05,137 --> 00:14:06,221
YEAH, BUDDY.

335
00:14:07,222 --> 00:14:09,683
REGULAR SCHOOL MEANS
REGULAR CONSEQUENCES.

336
00:14:09,766 --> 00:14:10,684
WHEN YOU RETURN,

337
00:14:10,767 --> 00:14:13,812
YOU'LL BE BETTER EQUIPPED
TO DEAL WITH YOUR FEELINGS.

338
00:14:21,445 --> 00:14:22,362
HOLLY J:
IF YOU CAN FIND TWO NUMBERS

339
00:14:22,446 --> 00:14:23,655
THAT YOU ADD TOGETHER
TO GET B,

340
00:14:23,739 --> 00:14:24,656
AND MULTIPLY TOGETHER
TO GET C,

341
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:26,450
THEN IT'S FACTORABLE.
GET IT?

342
00:14:26,533 --> 00:14:29,578
(SIGHS) HASLETT U SHOULD'VE
GOTTEN BACK TO ME BY NOW.

343
00:14:29,661 --> 00:14:31,413
THEY SAID THEY'D LET ME KNOW
BY END OF DAY.

344
00:14:31,496 --> 00:14:33,123
WELL, IT'S NOT
THE END OF DAY YET.

345
00:14:33,207 --> 00:14:34,499
WELL, WHAT IF I WROTE
THE WRONG NUMBER DOWN

346
00:14:34,583 --> 00:14:37,169
OR THEY CALLED THE HOME LINE
AND THE MESSAGE GOT ERASED?

347
00:14:37,252 --> 00:14:39,087
ANYA, RELAX.
YOU SAID IT WENT WELL.

348
00:14:39,171 --> 00:14:40,714
I'M SURE YOU HAVE NOTHING
TO WORRY ABOUT.

349
00:14:40,797 --> 00:14:42,382
OKAY, WELL, IF THEY HAVEN'T
CALLED ME BACK TONIGHT,

350
00:14:42,466 --> 00:14:44,218
I WILL STOP BY HIS OFFICE
IN THE MORNING.

351
00:14:44,301 --> 00:14:45,636
ARE YOU SURE
THAT'S A GOOD IDEA?

352
00:14:45,719 --> 00:14:48,013
YEAH,
IT SHOWS INITIATIVE.

353
00:14:48,096 --> 00:14:49,306
