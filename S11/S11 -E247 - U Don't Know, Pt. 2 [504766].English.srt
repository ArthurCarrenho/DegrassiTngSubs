00:00:06,256 --> 00:00:09,551
SO, I'LL PICK YOU UP
AFTER SCHOOL FOR DIALYSIS,

2
00:00:09,635 --> 00:00:10,802
AND DON'T FORGET...

3
00:00:10,886 --> 00:00:12,429
MONITOR MY WATER INTAKE.

4
00:00:12,513 --> 00:00:14,056
ARE YOU SURE
YOU'RE GONNA BE OKAY?

5
00:00:14,139 --> 00:00:16,433
YOU'VE HAD A LOT
TO DIGEST.

6
00:00:16,517 --> 00:00:19,061
I JUST HEARD BACK
FROM THE MINISTRY OF RECORDS.

7
00:00:19,144 --> 00:00:20,687
AND?

8
00:00:20,771 --> 00:00:22,189
I GOT SOME
EXCITING NEWS.

9
00:00:22,272 --> 00:00:23,774
YOU FOUND
YOUR BIRTH PARENTS?

10
00:00:23,857 --> 00:00:26,652
MY BIRTH FATHER WITHHELD
HIS NAME, BUT...

11
00:00:26,735 --> 00:00:29,279
I FOUND MY BIRTH MOTHER
AND SHE LIVES NEARBY,

12
00:00:29,363 --> 00:00:30,531
SO...

13
00:00:30,614 --> 00:00:32,533
WOW! THAT'S GOOD.

14
00:00:33,909 --> 00:00:35,661
HER NAME'S DAWN.

15
00:00:35,744 --> 00:00:39,248
SO, I'M GONNA CALL HER
THIS MORNING.

16
00:00:40,791 --> 00:00:42,000
MOM, I KINDA FEEL WEIRD
ABOUT THIS,

17
00:00:42,084 --> 00:00:44,127
LIKE I'M CHEATING ON YOU
OR SOMETHING.

18
00:00:44,211 --> 00:00:44,962
I CAN'T IMAGINE

19
00:00:45,045 --> 00:00:47,214
WHAT YOU MUST BE
GOING THROUGH.

20
00:00:47,297 --> 00:00:49,216
I'LL BE FINE,
HONESTLY.

21
00:00:50,217 --> 00:00:53,470
AS WEIRD AS IT IS
FINDING OUT I'M ADOPTED,

22
00:00:53,554 --> 00:00:54,471
THERE'S A SILVER LINING

23
00:00:54,555 --> 00:00:56,181
BECAUSE I MIGHT GET MY KIDNEY,
RIGHT?

24
00:00:56,265 --> 00:00:57,182
(SCHOOL BELL RINGS)

25
00:00:57,266 --> 00:00:58,433
FINGERS CROSSED.

26
00:00:58,517 --> 00:00:59,518
YEAH.

27
00:01:05,232 --> 00:01:07,651
MARY KATE:
HOLLY J?

28
00:01:07,734 --> 00:01:10,863
JUST REMEMBER WE DON'T KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT THIS PERSON.

29
00:01:10,946 --> 00:01:12,197
BE CAREFUL.

30
00:01:13,198 --> 00:01:14,741
I'LL KEEP MY EYES OPEN,

YOU'LL STRETCH IT OUT
OF SHAPE, ADAM

49
00:02:09,004 --> 00:02:10,297
IT FEELS TIGHT.

50
00:02:11,298 --> 00:02:12,716
I THINK ALL MY SHIRTS
ARE TOO TIGHT.

51
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:13,717
(CHUCKLES)

52
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,761
I CAN TAKE A HINT.
YOU WANT TO GO SHOPPING.

53
00:02:15,844 --> 00:02:18,805
NO, IT'S NOT ABOUT
THE SHIRTS.

54
00:02:18,889 --> 00:02:20,349
IT'S WHAT LIES UNDERNEATH.

55
00:02:20,432 --> 00:02:21,767
STOP BEING CRYPTIC.

56
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:25,103
I WAS HOPING
WE COULD TALK SOME MORE

57
00:02:25,187 --> 00:02:28,398
ABOUT CHEST
RECONSTRUCTION?

58
00:02:28,482 --> 00:02:29,942
(SIGHS HEAVILY)
AH...

59
00:02:30,025 --> 00:02:31,401
YOU KNOW HOW I FEEL
ABOUT SURGERY.

60
00:02:31,485 --> 00:02:32,903
WHICH IS WHY
I'M BRINGING IT UP AGAIN.

61
00:02:32,986 --> 00:02:35,364
AND I RESPECT THAT
YOU FEEL LIKE A BOY-

62
00:02:35,447 --> 00:02:38,450
I DON'T FEEL LIKE A BOY!
I AM!

63
00:02:40,661 --> 00:02:42,871
YOU'RE FIFTEEN, OKAY?

64
00:02:42,955 --> 00:02:45,123
YOUR BODY IS STILL CHANGING,

65
00:02:45,207 --> 00:02:47,835
AND WE'RE TALKING ABOUT
REMOVING PARTS OF YOU.

66
00:02:47,918 --> 00:02:50,420
YOU MAKE IT SOUND
SO HORRIBLE.

67
00:02:50,504 --> 00:02:53,090
I'LL MAKE A DEAL
WITH YOU.

68
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:55,092
WE'LL SPEAK TO YOUR COUNSELLOR
ABOUT THIS.

69
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:56,885
REALLY?

70
00:02:56,969 --> 00:02:58,929
SO, IF SHE OKAYS ME
FOR SURGERY...

71
00:02:59,012 --> 00:03:02,182
THEN WE'LL HAVE SOME
DECISIONS TO MAKE.

72
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:04,601
OKAY. COOL.

73
00:03:07,813 --> 00:03:08,814
COOL.

74
00:03:12,359 --> 00:03:13,861
HOLLY J:
IT'S RINGING.

75
00:03:13,944 --> 00:03:14,862
OH MY GOD,
WHAT IF I GET VOICEMAIL?

76
00:03:14,945 --> 00:03:15,654
WHAT DO I SAY?

77
00:03:15,737 --> 00:03:16,655
"HI, THIS IS YOUR BIRTH
DAUGHTER.

78
00:03:16,738 --> 00:03:17,823
MAY I HAVE YOUR KIDNEY?"

79
00:03:17,906 --> 00:03:19,741
HELLO? HI, DAWN?

80
00:03:21,493 --> 00:03:24,788
I'M HOLLY J.
HOLLY J SINCLAIR.

81
00:03:24,872 --> 00:03:25,789
NO, WAIT.

82
00:03:25,873 --> 00:03:28,292
NO, I'M NOT TRYING TO SELL YOU
ANYTHING.

83
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:32,045
I ACTUALLY CALLED
TO ASK YOU SOMETHING.

84
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:37,134
DID YOU PUT A BABY
UP FOR ADOPTION IN 1994?

85
00:03:39,094 --> 00:03:41,555
I KNOW IT'S A PRIVATE QUESTION.

86
00:03:41,638 --> 00:03:44,808
I HAVE A GOOD REASON TO ASK.

87
00:03:44,892 --> 00:03:46,310
THAT BABY IS...

88
00:03:48,312 --> 00:03:49,313
THAT'S ME.

89
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,943
YEAH, I JUST FOUND
YOUR INFO ONLINE.

90
00:03:55,027 --> 00:03:57,279
I THOUGHT
WE COULD MEET UP.

91
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:03,243
GREAT.

92
00:04:04,578 --> 00:04:06,079
GREAT, YEAH.
UM...

93
00:04:06,163 --> 00:04:08,707
THERE'S THIS PLACE
CALLED "THE DOT".

94
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:10,876
AFTER SCHOOL,
MAYBE 4:00?

95
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:16,089
OKAY, I'LL SEE YOU THERE.

96
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:18,467
YEAH. BYE, DAWN.

97
00:04:19,468 --> 00:04:20,886
(PHONE BEEPS OFF)

98
00:04:20,969 --> 00:04:22,471
(ASTONISHED EXHALE)

99
00:04:24,932 --> 00:04:26,725
(GASPS)

100
00:04:26,808 --> 00:04:29,353
I'M MEETING MY BIRTH MOM
FOR COFFEE?!

101
00:04:29,436 --> 00:04:31,313
HOLLY J,
THAT IS SO AWESOME!

102
00:04:33,774 --> 00:04:35,567
MS. DAWES:
FOR THOSE HOPEFULS
WHO AUDITIONED,

103
00:04:35,651 --> 00:04:38,820
THE ROLES ARE NOW POSTED
ON THE BOARD.

104
00:04:40,989 --> 00:04:44,076
GIRL:
(GASPS EXCITEDLY)
GOT IT!

105
00:04:45,327 --> 00:04:46,995
(BREATHLESS)
YES.

106
00:04:47,079 --> 00:04:48,914
I'M GOING TO BE CLARA!

107
00:04:51,208 --> 00:04:52,960
THANK YOU SO MUCH,
ELI!

108
00:04:53,043 --> 00:04:56,088
ELI:
YOU DESERVED IT.
YOU WERE AWESOME!

109
00:04:56,171 --> 00:04:58,131
YOU CAN GET OFF ME NOW.

110
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:01,468
ELI, WE DON'T HAVE
TO PRETEND.

111
00:05:01,552 --> 00:05:04,012
I KNOW I'M YOUR LEADING LADY
BOTH ON STAGE

112
00:05:04,096 --> 00:05:06,098
AND IN YOUR HEART.

113
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:09,977
IMOGEN,
WE'RE NOT TOGETHER.

114
00:05:10,978 --> 00:05:12,187
(CHUCKLES)

115
00:05:12,271 --> 00:05:15,774
BUT YESTERDAY
YOU KISSED ME BACK.

116
00:05:15,858 --> 00:05:17,234
I'M FLATTERED,
BUT...

117
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:18,986
I'M NOT IN
THE RIGHT PLACE,

118
00:05:19,069 --> 00:05:21,822
EMOTIONALLY SPEAKING.

119
00:05:21,905 --> 00:05:25,200
WHERE ARE YOU,
EMOTIONALLY SPEAKING?

120
00:05:26,201 --> 00:05:27,244
WELL, I'M OFF MY MEDS

121
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:30,330
SO MY EMOTIONS
ARE A MOVING TARGET.

122
00:05:30,414 --> 00:05:31,290
AND I'M JUST STARTING
TO FEEL A LITTLE BETTER -

123
00:05:31,373 --> 00:05:32,749
GETTING OVER CLARE
AND SUCH.

124
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:34,710
I DON'T WANT TO MESS
WITH THAT.

125
00:05:34,793 --> 00:05:35,794
YOU UNDERSTAND.

126
00:05:40,048 --> 00:05:42,050
FIONA:
CONGRATS, IMOGEN.

127
00:05:46,847 --> 00:05:49,641
KATIE:
I CAN'T BELIEVE RYAN LYNCH
TALKED TO ME FOR SO LONG.

128
00:05:49,725 --> 00:05:52,102
ADAM:
WHAT DID HE WRITE IN YOUR BOOK?

129
00:05:52,186 --> 00:05:53,812
KATIE:
"TO KATIE,
DON'T GIVE UP ON YOUR DREAMS

130
00:05:53,896 --> 00:05:56,607
AND THEY WON'T GIVE UP ON YOU."

131
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:59,818
I TOLD HIM ABOUT MY DREAM
OF BECOMING A JOURNALIST.

132
00:05:59,902 --> 00:06:02,029
ADAM:
THAT'S MY DREAM.

133
00:06:02,112 --> 00:06:03,071
I'M SERIOUS!

134
00:06:03,155 --> 00:06:04,990
I'M HOPING TO BE
A RADIO JOURNALISM MAJOR.

135
00:06:05,073 --> 00:06:06,491
KATIE:
REALLY?

136
00:06:06,575 --> 00:06:09,077
WELL, YOU DO HAVE QUITE
A PRESENCE ON-AIR.

137
00:06:09,161 --> 00:06:10,329
WE COULD GO
TO THE SAME UNIVERSITY!

138
00:06:10,412 --> 00:06:12,915
STUDY TOGETHER!
IT'D BE AWESOME!

139
00:06:12,998 --> 00:06:15,667
ARE YOU ALWAYS
THIS ENTHUSIASTIC?

140
00:06:15,751 --> 00:06:16,668
JUST HAPPY I GUESS.

141
00:06:16,752 --> 00:06:20,422
I'M HAVING A FUN TIME

142
00:06:20,506 --> 00:06:21,798
I LIKE YOU.

143
00:06:22,799 --> 00:06:25,302

JUST SO YOU KNOW

146
00:06:29,097 --> 00:06:30,307
I'M GONNA BE MAKING
SOME CHANGES.

147
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:32,184
REALLY?
WHAT KIND OF CHANGES?

148
00:06:32,267 --> 00:06:34,186
YOU KNOW,
PHYSICAL STUFF.

149
00:06:35,187 --> 00:06:37,940
SURE.
WHATEVER YOU NEED TO DO.

150
00:06:38,023 --> 00:06:40,317
HEY, I'M STARVING.
YOU WANNA GRAB POUTINE?

151
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,903
FRIES, GRAVY AND CHEESE?
THOUGHT YOU'D NEVER ASK.

152
00:06:43,904 --> 00:06:46,031
FIONA:
I BET SHE GAVE YOU UP
TO PURSUE THIS BRILLIANT CAREER,

153
00:06:46,114 --> 00:06:48,492
MADE BIG MONEY,
CONQUERED THE BUSINESS WORLD.

154
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:49,952

BUT DON'T FORGET
WHY WE'RE HERE, OKAY?

156
00:06:53,038 --> 00:06:54,831
HOLLY J:
LET'S DO THIS.

157
00:06:54,915 --> 00:06:55,958
WHERE IS SHE?

158
00:06:57,292 --> 00:06:59,711
NOPE. NOPE.

159
00:07:01,088 --> 00:07:02,089
NO.

160
00:07:04,925 --> 00:07:05,926
THERE SHE IS.

161
00:07:11,723 --> 00:07:14,518
HI, EXCUSE ME,
I'M HOLLY J.

162
00:07:14,601 --> 00:07:16,228

164
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:19,690
IT'S ME, DAWN.

165
00:07:19,773 --> 00:07:21,108
YOU MUST HAVE MISSED ME

166
00:07:21,191 --> 00:07:23,360
SITTING OVER HERE

167
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:25,112
I GUESS I DID.

168
00:07:33,078 --> 00:07:35,372
CLARE!
(GASPS)

169
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:37,082
DON'T DO THAT!

170
00:07:37,165 --> 00:07:38,166
SORRY.

171
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:40,711
JUST REALLY WANTED
TO THANK YOU.

172
00:07:40,794 --> 00:07:41,962
YOU GOT THE PART!

173
00:07:42,045 --> 00:07:43,505
AND I GOT THE BOY.

174
00:07:44,882 --> 00:07:45,799
REALLY?

175
00:07:45,883 --> 00:07:48,969
WITHOUT YOU,
THERE'D BE NO ME AND ELI.

176
00:07:49,052 --> 00:07:50,053
WELL, I'M GLAD

178
00:07:52,014 --> 00:07:53,182
ME TOO.

179
00:07:53,265 --> 00:07:56,476
SO, AS A TOKEN
OF MY ETERNAL APPRECIATION,

180
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,353
DINNER FOR TWO
AT THAT STEAK PLACE.

181
00:07:58,437 --> 00:07:59,354
THOUGHT YOU COULD TAKE
YOUR BOYFRIEND

182
00:07:59,438 --> 00:08:00,814
OUT ON A DATE.

183
00:08:00,898 --> 00:08:01,732
REALLY?

184
00:08:01,815 --> 00:08:02,941
WOW! THAT'S SO NICE,
IMOGEN.

185
00:08:03,025 --> 00:08:03,942
JAKE'S A STEAK GUY.

186
00:08:04,026 --> 00:08:05,319
I THOUGHT SO.

187
00:08:05,402 --> 00:08:06,778
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'LL CALL HIM,

188
00:08:06,862 --> 00:08:07,779
SEE IF HE'S FREE TONIGHT.

189
00:08:07,863 --> 00:08:08,906
EXCELLENT.

190
00:08:12,534 --> 00:08:14,077
DAWN:
IT WAS MY FIRST YEAR
OF UNIVERSITY

191
00:08:14,161 --> 00:08:16,496
WHEN MY BOYFRIEND -

192
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:18,498
YOUR FATHER,
I GUESS -

193
00:08:18,582 --> 00:08:21,084
HEARD ABOUT MY SITUATION.

194
00:08:21,168 --> 00:08:23,212
NEVER HEARD
FROM HIM AGAIN.

195
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:26,298
BY THE TIME THAT I KNEW
THAT I WAS PREGNANT,

196
00:08:26,381 --> 00:08:28,425
I HAD TWO CHOICES:

197
00:08:28,509 --> 00:08:30,552
DROP OUT,
RAISE A BABY,

198
00:08:30,636 --> 00:08:33,013
OR GIVE UP THE BABY,

199
00:08:33,096 --> 00:08:37,017
STAY IN UNIVERSITY
AND GET A CAREER.

200
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:38,644
IT WASN'T EASY.

201
00:08:38,727 --> 00:08:43,106
IT TOOK ME NEARLY A YEAR
TO DECIDE TO GIVE YOU UP.

202
00:08:44,107 --> 00:08:47,778
HOLLY J:
FOR THE RECORD,
I DON'T BLAME YOU.

203
00:08:47,861 --> 00:08:49,780
YOU KNOW, HOLLY J'S QUITE
AMBITIOUS HERSELF.

204
00:08:49,863 --> 00:08:51,615
SHE'S GOING TO YALE
THIS YEAR.

205
00:08:51,698 --> 00:08:53,575
YALE?
THAT'S AMAZING!

206
00:08:54,576 --> 00:08:56,578
I'M A WESTERN ALUMNI
MYSELF.

207
00:08:56,662 --> 00:08:57,663
THAT'S AWESOME!

208
00:08:57,746 --> 00:08:58,956
WHAT DID YOU MAJOR IN?

209
00:08:59,039 --> 00:08:59,957
COMMERCE.

210
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,333
I WORK IN
THE FINANCIAL SECTOR.

211
00:09:01,416 --> 00:09:04,336
I'M A SENIOR
ACCOUNTS ASSOCIATE.

212
00:09:05,337 --> 00:09:07,339
SO YOU HANDLE
IMPORTANT ACCOUNTS?

213
00:09:07,422 --> 00:09:08,590
WELL...

214
00:09:08,674 --> 00:09:10,634
NOT SO MUCH THESE DAYS.

215
00:09:10,717 --> 00:09:13,679
I'M REALLY JUST
A GLORIFIED BANK TELLER.

216
00:09:13,762 --> 00:09:14,680
BUT THE HOURS ARE FLEX

217
00:09:14,763 --> 00:09:18,809
AND BEING A SINGLE MOM,
THAT'S... THAT'S GOLDEN.

218
00:09:18,892 --> 00:09:19,810
SO, HOLLY J,

219
00:09:19,893 --> 00:09:21,812
I'M SURE DAWN WOULD LOVE
TO HEAR MORE ABOUT YOU.

220
00:09:21,895 --> 00:09:23,397
YES, PLEASE!

221
00:09:24,898 --> 00:09:28,026
WELL, I'M...
I ALREADY MENTIONED YALE.

222
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:30,320
UM, I GRADUATE
HIGH SCHOOL SOON,

223
00:09:30,404 --> 00:09:32,823
SO I'M STOKED ABOUT THAT.

224
00:09:32,906 --> 00:09:34,157
AND UM...

225
00:09:36,034 --> 00:09:40,706
FIONA:
HOLLY J HAS SOMETHING
IMPORTANT TO ASK YOU.

226
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:45,586
(SIGHS HEAVILY)

227
00:09:48,922 --> 00:09:52,426
YEAH, WERE YOUR WISDOM TEETH
IMPACTED?

228
00:09:53,427 --> 00:09:55,095
MINE WERE FINE.

229
00:09:56,096 --> 00:09:57,556
IS THAT ALL?

230
00:09:57,639 --> 00:10:00,642
NO, MY DENTIST THINKS
MINE MIGHT BE SO UH...

231
00:10:00,726 --> 00:10:01,768
I JUST WANTED TO KNOW
MY HISTORY.

232
00:10:02,895 --> 00:10:03,687
ANYWAY...

233
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:05,022
IT WAS REALLY GOOD
MEETING YOU,

234
00:10:05,105 --> 00:10:07,774
BUT I THINK I SHOULD GO.

235
00:10:07,858 --> 00:10:09,318
COME ON, FIONA,
WE'RE GONNA BE LATE.

236
00:10:09,401 --> 00:10:11,028
YEAH, WOULDN'T WANT
TO WASTE VALUABLE TIME,

237
00:10:11,111 --> 00:10:12,112
WOULD WE?

238
00:10:25,042 --> 00:10:26,752
SO, DID I PASS?

239
00:10:27,753 --> 00:10:29,880
IT'S NOT THAT
KIND OF TEST.

240
00:10:29,963 --> 00:10:32,090
THE QUESTIONNAIRE
IS STEP ONE.

241
00:10:32,174 --> 00:10:33,091
THERES SO MUCH MORE
TO COVER

242
00:10:33,175 --> 00:10:35,260
BEFORE I CAN MAKE
A RECOMMENDATION ABOUT SURGERY.

243
00:10:36,678 --> 00:10:39,056
GREAT.
SO, WHAT'S STEP TWO?

244
00:10:39,139 --> 00:10:41,517
WELL, GENERALLY WE RECOMMEND
FURTHER COUNSELLING

245
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,519
BEFORE STARTING
HORMONE THERAPY.

246
00:10:43,602 --> 00:10:45,479
I DON'T NEED
COUNSELLING!

247
00:10:45,562 --> 00:10:47,147
AUDRA:
HONEY, WE JUST WANT
TO MAKE SURE.

248
00:10:47,231 --> 00:10:48,565
WHAT IF YOU CHANGE
YOUR MIND?

249
00:10:48,649 --> 00:10:49,942
I WON'T!

250
00:10:50,025 --> 00:10:50,859
I JUST NEED TO FIX MY CHEST

251
00:10:50,943 --> 00:10:52,903
SO I WON'T FREAK OUT
THIS GIRL!

252
00:10:52,986 --> 00:10:55,656
AUDRA:
THIS IS ABOUT A GIRL?

253
00:10:55,739 --> 00:10:58,575
NO, THAT'S NOT
WHAT I MEANT.

254
00:11:00,702 --> 00:11:03,622
ADAM, YOUR BODY'S
STILL CHANGING.

255
00:11:03,705 --> 00:11:05,582
I JUST WANT TO LOOK
LIKE HOW I FEEL,

256
00:11:05,666 --> 00:11:07,751
AND I CAN'T BECAUSE
OF THESE.

257
00:11:07,835 --> 00:11:09,211
STRAPPING THEM DOWN
ALL THE TIME ISN'T WORKING.

258
00:11:09,294 --> 00:11:10,712
PEOPLE CAN TELL!

259
00:11:10,796 --> 00:11:12,047
THAT I CAN HELP WITH.

260
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:14,508
THERE ARE ALTERNATIVES.

261
00:11:16,009 --> 00:11:17,511
TAKE A LOOK.

262
00:11:23,892 --> 00:11:25,727
(EMOTIONAL SIGH)

263
00:11:25,811 --> 00:11:29,690
HOSPITAL P.A.:
DR. STODDARD, LINE TWO.
DR. STODDARD, LINE TWO.

264
00:11:29,773 --> 00:11:31,066
HOLLY J:
I'M SUCH A LOSER.

265
00:11:31,149 --> 00:11:33,402
FIONA:
YOU'RE NOT A LOSER.

266
00:11:33,485 --> 00:11:34,486
YOU CHOKED.

267
00:11:36,738 --> 00:11:41,243
SO, I GUESS IT'S FINALLY
STARTING TO SETTLE IN.

268
00:11:41,326 --> 00:11:42,327
I GUESS I'VE ALWAYS BEEN
MORE FOCUSED

269
00:11:42,411 --> 00:11:44,913
ON WHERE I'M GOING,
BUT...

270
00:11:46,707 --> 00:11:47,666
YEAH.

271
00:11:48,458 --> 00:11:51,336
I WANT TO GET TO KNOW DAWN.

272
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:52,421
THERE'LL BE TIME
FOR ALL THAT

273
00:11:52,504 --> 00:11:54,923
ONCE YOU ASK HER
TO GET TESTED.

274
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:56,633
WHAT IF I SCARE HER OFF?

275
00:11:56,717 --> 00:11:58,051
WHAT'S MORE IMPORTANT -

276
00:11:58,135 --> 00:11:59,970
HAVING A RELATIONSHIP
WITH YOUR BIRTH MOM

277
00:12:00,053 --> 00:12:03,599
OR GETTING HEALTHY,
GOING TO YALE,

278
00:12:03,682 --> 00:12:05,184
LIVING LIFE?

279
00:12:18,363 --> 00:12:21,658
♪ I got a feeling
that's shaking the tree ♪

280
00:12:23,202 --> 00:12:24,536
THANK YOU.

281
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:27,623
TRUST ME,
THIS IS SO MUCH BETTER

282
00:12:27,706 --> 00:12:28,707
THAN MOVIE NIGHT
WITH OUR PARENTS.

283
00:12:35,714 --> 00:12:37,132
HEY!
YOU SAID IN YOUR TEXT

284
00:12:37,216 --> 00:12:39,009
YOU WANTED TO TALK
ABOUT CLARA?

285
00:12:39,092 --> 00:12:41,345
YEAH, JUST SOME
BACKSTORY-TYPE QUESTIONS

286
00:12:41,428 --> 00:12:43,639
I WANTED TO HASH OUT.

287
00:12:43,722 --> 00:12:47,142
YOU LOOK FANTASTIC,
BY THE WAY.

288
00:12:47,226 --> 00:12:49,269
COOL.
SO, SHOULD WE SIT DOWN?

289
00:12:49,353 --> 00:12:51,980
UM, CAN WE GO SIT LIKE
BACK THERE?

290
00:12:52,064 --> 00:12:53,232
ELI:
UH, 'KAY.

291
00:12:54,775 --> 00:12:56,318
YOU KNOW, WE REALLY SHOULD
TELL THEM EVENTUALLY.

292
00:12:56,401 --> 00:12:59,154
"HEY, MOM, I'M DATING
YOUR BOYFRIEND'S SON!"

293
00:12:59,238 --> 00:13:01,156
(LAUGHING)
NO THANKS.

294
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:03,033
HOW ABOUT WE TRY NOT
TO THINK ABOUT IT.

295
00:13:06,703 --> 00:13:08,163
IMOGEN:
OH, SORRY!

296
00:13:08,247 --> 00:13:09,915
DIDN'T SEE YOU
TWO LOVEBIRDS.

297
00:13:09,998 --> 00:13:11,792
AWKWARD!

298
00:13:11,875 --> 00:13:14,545
COME ON, MUFFIN,
LET'S GO SIT.

299
00:13:14,628 --> 00:13:16,171
ELI, YOU KNOW JAKE.

300
00:13:19,424 --> 00:13:21,593
WHAT A COINCIDENCE,
HUH, IMOGEN?

301
00:13:21,677 --> 00:13:24,763
JUST TRYING
TO BREAK THE ICE.

302
00:13:24,847 --> 00:13:26,348
HOW'S IT GOIN'?

303
00:13:26,431 --> 00:13:27,516
LET'S GO SIT DOWN,
OKAY, MUFFIN?

304
00:13:27,599 --> 00:13:29,893
STOP CALLING ME THAT!

305
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:36,316
THE REAL CLARE EDWARDS
WOULD NEVER DO

306
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:38,026
WHAT YOU JUST DID.

307
00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:40,529
WE BOTH KNOW
THAT'S NOT TRUE.

308
00:13:40,612 --> 00:13:42,823
THE REAL CLARE EDWARDS
WOULD DO ANYTHING

309
00:13:42,906 --> 00:13:44,616
TO GET WHAT SHE WANTS.

310
00:13:46,451 --> 00:13:48,120

HEY, KATIE.

312
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:03,093
LAST NIGHT
WAS CRAZY FUN.

313
00:14:03,177 --> 00:14:04,595
WASN'T IT?

314
00:14:04,678 --> 00:14:06,221
I WAS HOPING
FOR A REPEAT.

315
00:14:06,305 --> 00:14:09,892
MAYBE WE COULD GO
TO A MOVIE FRIDAY?

316
00:14:09,975 --> 00:14:11,268
YEAH, UM,

317
00:14:13,061 --> 00:14:16,690
ADAM, I THINK MAYBE
YOU GOT THE WRONG IDEA?

318
00:14:17,691 --> 00:14:19,067
WHAT IDEA IS THAT?

319
00:14:19,151 --> 00:14:21,987
THAT I LIKE YOU
IN THAT WAY.

320
00:14:23,488 --> 00:14:25,199
UH, NO.

321
00:14:25,282 --> 00:14:26,992
KATIE, COME ON.

322
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:31,872
YOU'VE MISUNDERSTOOD.

00:14:42,174 --> 00:14:43,175
I DO HAVE THE RESULTS

OF YOUR FRIEND FIONA'S
BLOOD TESTS.

328
00:14:46,386 --> 00:14:48,514
THEIR NEGATIVE,
I'M AFRAID.

329
00:14:49,515 --> 00:14:52,392
OH. I'D NEVER ASK HER TO GO
THROUGH WITH IT ANYWAY.

330
00:14:52,476 --> 00:14:55,854

AND THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE.

331
00:14:57,147 --> 00:14:59,525
I'M LOOKING
AT YOUR LATEST TESTS,

332
00:14:59,608 --> 00:15:01,985
AND, UH,

333
00:15:02,069 --> 00:15:04,947
WE'D HOPED TO REALLY
SLOW THE PROCESS,

334
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:06,782
BUT I'M GONNA LEVEL WITH YOU.

335
00:15:06,865 --> 00:15:11,745

YOU WANTED TO HEAR.

00:15:15,332 --> 00:15:17,042
BUT, UH,

338
00:15:17,125 --> 00:15:19,586
I'VE PUT YOU ON
A TRANSPLANT LIST.

ABOUT 12 MONTHS,

340
00:15:21,797 --> 00:15:23,340
COULD BE SOONER.

341
00:15:23,423 --> 00:15:25,634
I'LL BE AT YALE BY THEN.

342
00:15:25,717 --> 00:15:28,220

DEFERRING YALE.

YOU WERE QUIET IN THERE.

348

DID YOU GOT THE LICENCE PLATE
OF THE GUY THAT RAN YOU OVER?

349
00:15:57,833 --> 00:15:59,459
IT WAS A GIRL.

350
00:15:59,543 --> 00:16:00,627

351
00:16:00,711 --> 00:16:01,879
AH, SORRY, MAN.

352
00:16:01,962 --> 00:16:03,463
I THOUGHT SOMETHING

WHAT DOES IT MEAN?

386
00:17:22,251 --> 00:17:23,669
