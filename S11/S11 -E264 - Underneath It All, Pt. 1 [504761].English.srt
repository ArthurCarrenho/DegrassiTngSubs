00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:01,338
WELL, GREAT.
I'LL SET EVERYTHING UP.

178
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:02,840
MS. OH:
AND BEFORE YOU KNOW IT,

179
00:07:02,923 --> 00:07:06,051
WE'LL ALL BE MAKING
BEAUTIFUL MUSIC TOGETHER.

180
00:07:06,134 --> 00:07:10,347
NEXT ORDER OF BUSINESS:
CHOOSING OUR INSTRUMENTS.

181
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:12,015
I'M SO SORRY
I'M LATE.

182
00:07:12,099 --> 00:07:13,851
I COULDN'T FIND
THE CLASSROOM.

183
00:07:13,934 --> 00:07:16,228
AND YOU ARE...?

184
00:07:16,311 --> 00:07:18,105
MAYA MATLIN?

185
00:07:18,188 --> 00:07:20,858
CLASS, WE HAVE
AN AWARD-WINNING ARTIST

186
00:07:20,941 --> 00:07:21,942
IN OUR MIDST.

187
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:24,444
MAYA, I ASSUME
YOU WANT THE CELLO.

188
00:07:24,528 --> 00:07:25,863
SURE. THANKS.

189
00:07:31,952 --> 00:07:34,663
TORI:
HE'S NOT IN THIS CLASS?
THEN WHERE IS HE?

190
00:07:34,746 --> 00:07:35,998
TRISTAN:
RELAX.

191
00:07:36,081 --> 00:07:38,375
I'LL GET INTEL
ON ZIG'S WHEREABOUTS.

192
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:40,169
OH, ZIG NOVAK?

193
00:07:40,252 --> 00:07:42,337
HE HAS ART NOW.

194
00:07:42,421 --> 00:07:43,839
IS HE A FRIEND OF YOURS?

195
00:07:43,922 --> 00:07:45,799
ZIG NOVAK IS NOT A FRIEND.

196
00:07:45,883 --> 00:07:48,886
TORI:
HE'S A JERK WHO USES GIRLS,
THEN BREAKS THEIR HEARTS.

197
00:07:48,969 --> 00:07:50,554
IF YOU'RE SMART,
YOU'LL STAY AWAY.

198
00:07:50,637 --> 00:07:52,806
TRISTAN:
FAR, FAR AWAY.

199
00:07:52,890 --> 00:07:53,891
MS. OH:
TRISTAN, RIGHT?

200
00:07:53,974 --> 00:07:57,060
UH, WE NEED A VOLUNTEER
FOR THE FRENCH HORN.

201
00:07:57,144 --> 00:07:58,145
TRISTAN:
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

202
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:02,566
FIONA:
SUSHI FOR TWENTY.

203
00:08:02,649 --> 00:08:04,067
YOUR USUAL SPREAD
IS ALWAYS PERFECT,

204
00:08:04,151 --> 00:08:05,068
MR. ICHIRO.

205
00:08:05,152 --> 00:08:07,112
IT'S GONNA BE A GREAT PARTY.
THANKS!

206
00:08:07,196 --> 00:08:08,363
A PARTY?

207
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:10,866
I GUESS MY INVITE
GOT LOST IN CYBERSPACE.

208
00:08:10,949 --> 00:08:12,701
UH, IT'S JUST A SMALL
GET TOGETHER.

209
00:08:12,784 --> 00:08:14,453
DIDN'T THINK
YOU'D BE INTERESTED.

210
00:08:14,536 --> 00:08:16,121
YOU THOUGHT RIGHT;
I HAVE SPINNING CLASS TONIGHT.

211
00:08:16,205 --> 00:08:17,331
SPINNING CLASS?

212
00:08:17,414 --> 00:08:18,707
STARTED EXERCISING
THIS SUMMER.

213
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:19,708
AND ALTHOUGH
I WOULD RATHER SWEAT

214
00:08:19,791 --> 00:08:21,084
THAN ATTEND YOUR SOIREE,

215
00:08:21,168 --> 00:08:23,420
I'M SURE THAT IMOGEN
WOULD LOVE TO GO.

216
00:08:23,504 --> 00:08:25,172
IMOGEN:
THAT'S OKAY, ELI.

217
00:08:25,255 --> 00:08:27,674
I'M SURE I'M NOT INVITED
TO FIONA'S FETE.

218
00:08:27,758 --> 00:08:28,675
THAT'S RIDICULOUS.

219
00:08:28,759 --> 00:08:31,011
FIONA WOULD NEVER
EXCLUDE YOU.

220
00:08:31,094 --> 00:08:33,096
IT'S JUST A FEW
CLOSE FRIENDS.

221
00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:38,519
BUT, OF COURSE,
IMOGEN IS WELCOME.

222
00:08:38,602 --> 00:08:39,520
FOR REALSIES?!

223
00:08:39,603 --> 00:08:40,521
WANNA KNOW A SECRET?

224
00:08:40,604 --> 00:08:41,522
I'VE BEEN HOPING
WE'D BE FRIENDS

225
00:08:41,605 --> 00:08:42,523
SINCE WE DID
THAT PLAY TOGETHER.

226
00:08:42,606 --> 00:08:43,774
YOU HAVE?

227
00:08:43,857 --> 00:08:45,943
IMOGEN:
MOST GIRLS AT SCHOOL
TREAT ME LIKE CRAP.

228
00:08:46,026 --> 00:08:48,946
YOU PROBABLY
COULDN'T IMAGINE.

229
00:08:49,029 --> 00:08:50,280
YOU'D BE SURPRISED.

230
00:08:50,364 --> 00:08:51,532
WHEN I FIRST CAME
TO DEGRASSI,

231
00:08:51,615 --> 00:08:54,034
I COULDN'T MAKE A FRIEND
IF MY LIFE DEPENDED ON IT.

232
00:08:54,117 --> 00:08:55,369
FIONA COYNE?

233
00:08:55,452 --> 00:08:57,037
FIONA:
YEAH, IT WAS... SO LONELY,

234
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,122
I STARTED DRINKING.
A LOT.

235
00:08:59,206 --> 00:09:01,124
I SPENT THE SUMMER
IN REHAB,

236
00:09:01,208 --> 00:09:02,960
AND THAT'S WHERE I DECIDED
THINGS WOULD BE DIFFERENT;

237
00:09:03,043 --> 00:09:04,336
THAT THIS WOULD BE
THE BEST YEAR EVER.

238
00:09:04,419 --> 00:09:05,337
AND NOW YOU'RE FRIENDS

239
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:07,422
WITH THE MOST POPULAR GIRLS
AT SCHOOL.

240
00:09:07,506 --> 00:09:08,423
FRIEND-LY.

241
00:09:08,507 --> 00:09:10,467
I STILL HAVE A LONG WAY
TO GO.

242
00:09:10,551 --> 00:09:11,844
MAYBE I SHOULD GO
TO REHAB.

243
00:09:11,927 --> 00:09:12,928
(LAUGHING)

244
00:09:14,388 --> 00:09:16,098
LISTEN, WHY DON'T YOU
COME OVER BEFORE?

245
00:09:16,181 --> 00:09:18,016
WE CAN GET READY
TOGETHER.

246
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:20,102
(DRAMATICALLY)
SOMEBODY PINCH ME!

247
00:09:22,479 --> 00:09:23,981
OR NOT.

248
00:09:24,064 --> 00:09:25,607
(ELI AND FIONA CHUCKLE)

249
00:09:28,193 --> 00:09:31,238
DREW:
FEELS LIKE YESTERDAY
WE WERE UP AT YOUR CABIN.

250
00:09:31,321 --> 00:09:32,656
LIFE'S NOT SO BAD
IN THE CITY.

251
00:09:32,739 --> 00:09:33,657
LIVING WITH
YOUR GIRLFRIEND

252
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:35,534
MIGHT HAVE SOMETHING
TO DO WITH THAT.

253
00:09:35,617 --> 00:09:37,452
OWEN:
SO HOW MANY ROOMS
YOU GUYS DONE IT IN?

254
00:09:37,536 --> 00:09:38,662
(LAUGHING)

255
00:09:38,745 --> 00:09:40,414
CLARE:
IT IS SO NICE TO SEE
A FRIENDLY FACE

256
00:09:40,497 --> 00:09:42,165
AFTER A MORNING OF DEFLECTING
DEATH STARES

257
00:09:42,249 --> 00:09:43,917
FROM ALLI AND JENNA.

258
00:09:44,001 --> 00:09:46,170
OWEN:
OH, HI, CLARE.

259
00:09:46,253 --> 00:09:49,631
UM, JAKE WAS JUST UPDATING US
ON YOUR LIVING ARRANGEMENTS.

260
00:09:49,715 --> 00:09:51,884
DON'T YOU GUYS HAVE
SOMEWHERE TO BE?

261
00:09:51,967 --> 00:09:53,302
DREW:
UH, YEAH,
WE'LL, UH...

262
00:09:53,385 --> 00:09:54,887
CATCH UP WITH YOU,

00:09:54,970 --> 00:09:57,389
OWEN: I GOT YA, BRO.
DREW: THANKS, MAN.

264
00:09:57,472 --> 00:09:59,892
OKAY,
WHAT WAS THAT ABOUT?

265
00:09:59,975 --> 00:10:01,685
WELL, THE GUYS THINK THAT
NOW WE'RE LIVING TOGETHER,

266
00:10:01,768 --> 00:10:04,688
WE'RE DOING
OTHER THINGS TOGETHER.

267
00:10:04,771 --> 00:10:05,856
YOU MEAN SEX.

268
00:10:05,939 --> 00:10:06,940
I DIDN'T SAY WE WERE.

269
00:10:07,024 --> 00:10:08,650
BUT YOU MUST'VE THOUGHT
ABOUT IT.

270
00:10:08,734 --> 00:10:09,693
I KNOW YOU'RE NOT READY,

271
00:10:09,776 --> 00:10:12,946
AND PROBABLY WON'T BE
FOR A LONG TIME, SO...

272
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:14,781
WE SHOULD TALK.

273
00:10:17,951 --> 00:10:19,620
OKAY... OKAY.

274
00:10:19,703 --> 00:10:22,206
UH, HOW ABOUT TONIGHT?

275
00:10:22,289 --> 00:10:23,790
SOUNDS GOOD.

276
00:10:28,504 --> 00:10:29,755
FIONA:
SO WHEN IT COMES TO PARTIES,

277
00:10:29,838 --> 00:10:31,006
THE BIGGER,
THE BETTER, RIGHT?

278
00:10:31,089 --> 00:10:32,049
WRONG!

279
00:10:32,132 --> 00:10:33,634
WE SHOULD KEEP
THE GUEST LIST EXCLUSIVE.

280
00:10:33,717 --> 00:10:36,136
ONLY THE BEST
DEGRASSI HAS TO OFFER.

281
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:38,055
SO... BOYS?

282
00:10:38,138 --> 00:10:39,890
DREW, OF COURSE,
OWEN...

283
00:10:39,973 --> 00:10:42,309
MAYBE A FEW OTHER
FOOTBALL GUYS?

284
00:10:42,392 --> 00:10:45,062
WE'LL NEED MORE GIRLS
TO EVEN OUT THE NUMBERS.

FIONA:
RAMONA SEEMS NICE,

286
00:10:46,355 --> 00:10:48,690
AND, YOU KNOW,
MAYBE IMOGEN?

287
00:10:50,442 --> 00:10:52,528
IMOGEN?
SERIOUSLY?

288
00:10:52,611 --> 00:10:54,196
I THOUGHT MAYBE
IF WE GAVE HER A CHANCE-

289
00:10:54,279 --> 00:10:56,782
SHE'D STOP DRESSING
LIKE A CIRCUS PERFORMER?

290
00:10:56,865 --> 00:10:57,866
(GIRLS LAUGH)

291
00:11:00,369 --> 00:11:01,787
YOU ALREADY INVITED HER,
DIDN'T YOU?

292
00:11:02,788 --> 00:11:05,082
SHE OVERHEARD ME
ON THE PHONE.

293
00:11:05,165 --> 00:11:07,000
I GOT BACKED
INTO A CORNER.

294
00:11:08,001 --> 00:11:10,754
LET'S JUST CONSIDER IT
A SOCIAL EXPERIMENT.

295
00:11:10,838 --> 00:11:13,841
MARISOL:
WELL, AT LEAST WE WON'T HAVE
TO WORRY ABOUT ENTERTAINMENT.

SORRY I'M LATE.
STUDENT COUNCIL STUFF.

297
00:11:23,475 --> 00:11:24,810
THAT'S OKAY.
(TYPING)

298
00:11:28,605 --> 00:11:30,524
OOH!
ZIG NOVAK IS CUTE.

299
00:11:31,650 --> 00:11:34,194
DOES MY LITTLE SISTER
HAVE A CRUSH?

300
00:11:34,278 --> 00:11:36,655
WE'RE JUST FRIENDS -
BARELY.

301
00:11:37,656 --> 00:11:40,284
HE'S THE ONLY DECENT PERSON
I MET TODAY.

302
00:11:40,367 --> 00:11:41,368
SO THEN
WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?

303
00:11:41,451 --> 00:11:43,412
THIS GIRL IN MY BAND CLASS
THINKS HE'S THE DEVIL.

304
00:11:43,495 --> 00:11:44,454
SHE SOUNDS JEALOUS.

305
00:11:44,538 --> 00:11:45,581
OF ME?

306
00:11:45,664 --> 00:11:48,333
KATIE:
HARD TO BELIEVE,
ISN'T IT?

307
00:11:48,417 --> 00:11:49,751
WHEN I STARTED HANGING OUT
WITH DREW,

308
00:11:49,835 --> 00:11:51,837
ALL THESE GIRLS TOLD ME
HE WAS A STUPID JOCK

309
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:54,047
WHO ONLY CARED ABOUT SE-
SPORTS.

310
00:11:56,049 --> 00:11:57,217
WELL, ISN'T HE?

311
00:11:57,301 --> 00:11:59,219
NO, HE'S THE SWEETEST GUY
IN THE WORLD

312
00:11:59,303 --> 00:12:02,264
AND I WOULDN'T KNOW THAT
IF I LISTENED TO ALL THE GOSSIP.

313
00:12:02,347 --> 00:12:05,517
SO YOU THINK ZIG'S
PROBABLY OKAY?

314
00:12:06,643 --> 00:12:08,854
I THINK YOU SHOULD FIND OUT
FOR YOURSELF.

315
00:12:08,937 --> 00:12:09,938
OKAY.

316
00:12:11,231 --> 00:12:12,274
KATIE:
WELL, WE BETTER GET
A MOVE ON,

317
00:12:12,357 --> 00:12:14,943
I HAVE A PARTY
TO GET READY FOR.

318
00:12:15,027 --> 00:12:16,695
AND IF ZIG PULLS
ANY FUNNY BUSINESS,

319
00:12:16,778 --> 00:12:17,946
TELL HIM YOUR SISTER'S
SCHOOL PREZ

320
00:12:18,030 --> 00:12:20,365
AND I COULD MAKE
HIS LIFE HELL.

321
00:12:23,202 --> 00:12:24,536
FIONA:
OH, DON'T PUT
THE SUSHI OUT YET!

322
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:27,706
I'M TRYING TO MAKE FRIENDS
NOT POISON THEM.

324
00:12:33,045 --> 00:12:34,588
TA-DA!

00:12:34,671 --> 00:12:36,215
WOW! (LAUGHS)

326
00:12:36,298 --> 00:12:38,008
THAT IS QUITE
A DRESS!

327
00:12:38,091 --> 00:12:39,635
IMOGEN:
YOU LIKE?

328
00:12:39,718 --> 00:12:40,886
FIONA:
I LOVE.

329
00:12:43,388 --> 00:12:45,766
BUT, YOU KNOW, I HAVE A DRESS
THAT WOULD LOOK EVEN BETTER.

330
00:12:54,483 --> 00:12:55,567
TAKE A LOOK.

331
00:12:56,985 --> 00:12:59,321
OH, UM...

332
00:12:59,404 --> 00:13:01,990
THAT DRESS
IS VERY ELEGANT.

333
00:13:02,074 --> 00:13:03,784
IMAGINE IT
WITH YOUR HAIR DOWN.

334
00:13:05,202 --> 00:13:06,745
IMOGEN:
WHAT'S WRONG WITH MY HAIR?

335
00:13:06,828 --> 00:13:08,997
NOTHING.
I LOVE YOUR HAIR.

336
00:13:09,081 --> 00:13:12,668
I WAS JUST THINKING
ABOUT THE DRESS.

337
00:13:12,751 --> 00:13:14,711
I KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE TRYING TO DO.

338
00:13:14,795 --> 00:13:15,921
YOU'RE TRYING
TO CHANGE ME

339
00:13:16,004 --> 00:13:19,091
SO I DON'T EMBARRASS YOU
AT YOUR PARTY.

340
00:13:19,174 --> 00:13:20,342
THE DRESS WOULD BE
ONE LESS THING

341
00:13:20,425 --> 00:13:23,345
FOR PEOPLE TO MAKE FUN OF...

342
00:13:23,428 --> 00:13:25,055
AND SOME OF THE GIRLS
I INVITED

343
00:13:25,138 --> 00:13:26,306
WERE A LITTLE SURPRISED

344
00:13:26,390 --> 00:13:27,766
THAT YOUR NAME
WAS ON THE GUEST LIST.

345
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:29,518
I DON'T CARE
WHAT PEOPLE THINK.

346
00:13:29,601 --> 00:13:31,395
BUT IF YOU DID,

347
00:13:31,478 --> 00:13:33,522
WE COULD HAVE
