00:00:04,421 --> 00:00:05,756
ADAM:
HEY, DID IMOGEN
RETURN YOUR CALL?

2
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:07,257
NOPE.

3
00:00:07,341 --> 00:00:08,425
YEESH.
NOW YOU'RE PISSED.

4
00:00:08,509 --> 00:00:09,510
SHE'S SUPPOSED TO BE
MY GIRLFRIEND!

5
00:00:09,593 --> 00:00:11,220
SHE'S SHUNNING ME.

6
00:00:11,303 --> 00:00:13,096
WELL, YOU DID FREAK OUT
AND SMASH HER CAMERA.

7
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:14,556
IT WAS AN ACCIDENT!

8
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:15,557
AFTER SHE TOOK MY FACE,

9
00:00:15,641 --> 00:00:17,601
AND MADE ME INTO A BIPOLAR
ART PROJECT.

10
00:00:17,684 --> 00:00:18,685
I GUESS WE'RE BREAKING UP.

11
00:00:20,562 --> 00:00:23,398
ADAM:
WELL, IF YOU STILL LIKE HER,
JUST PLAY IT COOL;

12
00:00:23,482 --> 00:00:25,484
ASSESS, BE BREEZY.

13
00:00:26,985 --> 00:00:28,820
ELI:
I CAN DO BREEZY.

14
00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:32,950
HEY.

15
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:34,952
SORRY I MISSED YOUR CALLS
LAST NIGHT.

16
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:36,203
MY PHONE WAS OFF.

17
00:00:37,538 --> 00:00:38,705
I BROUGHT THE CAMERA.

18
00:00:38,789 --> 00:00:40,958
THANKS.
I CAN EXPLAIN-

19
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:42,042
NO NEED.

20
00:00:43,418 --> 00:00:45,128
WHAT DID YOU GET UP
TO LAST NIGHT?

21
00:00:45,212 --> 00:00:47,881
STAYED HOME.
HOMEWORK AND SUCH.

22
00:00:47,965 --> 00:00:49,550
WEIRD.
I STOPPED BY.

23
00:00:49,633 --> 00:00:51,176
YOUR DAD SAID
YOU WERE OUT WITH A FRIEND.

24
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:54,054
YOU WENT TO MY HOUSE?
AROUND SIX.

25
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:57,266
MY DAD'S SUCH
A SPACE CASE.

26
00:00:57,349 --> 00:00:59,142
I WAS OUT WALKING MY DOG.

27
00:00:59,226 --> 00:01:01,311
YOU HAVE TO MEET VOLTA
SOME DAY!

28
00:01:01,395 --> 00:01:02,646
ELI:
THAT EXPLAINS EVERYTHING.

29
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:04,898
UM, I'LL SEE YOU IN CLASS.

30
00:01:08,902 --> 00:01:11,196
HER DOG WAS AT HOME
WITH HER DAD.

31
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:12,614
SOMETIMES GIRLS DO THINGS

32
00:01:12,698 --> 00:01:14,283
THEY DON'T WANT THEIR BOYFRIENDS
TO KNOW ABOUT.

33
00:01:14,366 --> 00:01:16,201
LIKE CHEAT ON THEM.

34
00:01:16,285 --> 00:01:18,537
LIKE GET THEIR
MUSTACHES WAXED.

35
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:19,997
DON'T OVERREACT.

36
00:01:20,998 --> 00:01:24,084
OKAY. I'LL JUST KEEP
ACTING BREEZY.

I WAS JUST LOOKING

56
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:23,477
IT'S ME.

57
00:02:25,729 --> 00:02:27,397
(LAUGHS)
IT'S NOT FUNNY.

58
00:02:27,481 --> 00:02:28,941
I WAS LATE FOR PRACTICE.

59
00:02:29,024 --> 00:02:29,942
I'M THE NEW MASCOT

00:02:30,025 --> 00:02:32,528
UNTIL MARISOL CAN FIND
A REPLACEMENT.

61
00:02:32,611 --> 00:02:33,570
YOU'RE KIDDING.

62
00:02:33,654 --> 00:02:34,655
IF THAT WASN'T
BAD ENOUGH,

63
00:02:34,738 --> 00:02:36,573
MARISOL'S MAKING ME
ROAR FOR NICKELS

64
00:02:36,657 --> 00:02:38,450
TO RAISE MONEY
FOR POMPOMS.

65
00:02:38,534 --> 00:02:40,536
THIS IS SO HUMILIATING!

66
00:02:40,619 --> 00:02:41,662
(LAUGHS)

67
00:02:41,745 --> 00:02:43,830
OKAY, THIS IS WHERE YOU SAY,
"DON'T WORRY, TORI,

68
00:02:43,914 --> 00:02:45,541
NO ONE WILL REMEMBER
IN A WEEK."

69
00:02:45,624 --> 00:02:48,877
OH NO,
THEY'LL REMEMBER THIS ONE.

70
00:02:50,504 --> 00:02:51,964
I MEAN...

71
00:02:52,047 --> 00:02:55,968
IF YOU HATE IT SO MUCH,
THEN DON'T DO IT.

72
00:02:56,051 --> 00:02:57,135
MAYBE I WOULDN'T FEEL
SO SILLY

73
00:02:57,219 --> 00:03:01,056
IF I HAD MY BOYFRIEND
BY MY SIDE WHILE I ROARED?

74
00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:03,600
I PROMISED I'D SKATEBOARD
WITH THE GUYS AT LUNCH.

75
00:03:03,684 --> 00:03:05,894
CAN'T YOU UN-PROMISE?

76
00:03:05,978 --> 00:03:07,938
TOR,
IF I DITCH THE GUYS

77
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:10,274
TO HANG OUT
WITH MY GIRLFRIEND,

78
00:03:10,357 --> 00:03:13,110
THEY'LL MAKE FUN OF ME
FOREVER.

79
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:14,111

81
00:03:16,655 --> 00:03:18,991
WHY DOES IT SMELL
LIKE CHEESE?

82
00:03:29,168 --> 00:03:30,919
JAKE:
BY THE WAY, YOUR SPANISH NOTES
WERE A LIFESAVER.

83
00:03:31,003 --> 00:03:31,920
THANKS.

84
00:03:32,004 --> 00:03:33,797
IMOGEN:
I THINK YOU MEAN
MUCHAS GRACIAS.

85
00:03:33,881 --> 00:03:34,882
(LAUGHING)

86
00:03:37,009 --> 00:03:38,969
DIDN'T KNOW YOU AND JAKE
WERE FRIENDS.

87
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:40,470
HE'S FRIENDLY.

88
00:03:40,554 --> 00:03:42,723
THEREFORE,
WE'RE FRIENDLY.

89
00:03:43,724 --> 00:03:45,058
OKAY...
THAT'S ALL, ELI.

90
00:03:45,142 --> 00:03:46,643
I SAID OKAY.

91
00:03:48,395 --> 00:03:50,397
SORRY.
NO, I'M SORRY.

92
00:03:51,857 --> 00:03:54,109
BOTH:
MAYBE WE SHOULD...

93
00:03:54,193 --> 00:03:55,903
YOU FIRST.

94
00:03:55,986 --> 00:03:57,988
GO SOMEWHERE
AND TALK?

95
00:03:58,071 --> 00:03:59,072
ABOUT?

96
00:03:59,781 --> 00:04:01,325
US.

97
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:04,119
WHY? US IS GREAT,
NEVER BETTER.

98
00:04:04,203 --> 00:04:05,495
YOU REALLY THINK THAT?

99
00:04:05,579 --> 00:04:06,914
DON'T YOU?

100
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:10,918
YEAH, I GUESS.

101
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:12,836
GOOD.

102
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,505
THEN THE ONLY THING "US"
NEEDS TO TALK ABOUT

103
00:04:14,588 --> 00:04:16,298
IS WHAT WE'RE DOING TONIGHT.

104
00:04:16,381 --> 00:04:17,633
I ALREADY HAVE PLANS.

105
00:04:17,716 --> 00:04:19,134
WITH JAKE?

106
00:04:19,218 --> 00:04:21,887
GIRLS NIGHT
AT CASA COYNE.

107
00:04:23,514 --> 00:04:25,766
YOU'RE WELCOME
TO JOIN US.

108
00:04:25,849 --> 00:04:26,767
HEY, JUST BECAUSE
WE'RE DATING

109
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:28,477
DOESN'T MEAN WE HAVE TO SPEND
EVERY SECOND TOGETHER.

110
00:04:31,063 --> 00:04:32,064
OKAY.

111
00:04:33,524 --> 00:04:36,151
ARMSTRONG:
OKAY. TODAY'S THE DAY
YOU'VE ALL BEEN WAITING FOR.

112
00:04:36,235 --> 00:04:39,279
WE BEGIN LOGARITHMIC FUNCTIONS.

113
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:43,492
CONNOR.
THANK YOU

114
00:04:43,575 --> 00:04:45,494
KC, DO YOU HAVE
AN ASSIGNMENT FOR ME?

115
00:04:45,577 --> 00:04:46,620
NOT TODAY.

116
00:04:47,621 --> 00:04:48,539
MINUS AN ENTIRE
LETTER GRADE

117
00:04:48,622 --> 00:04:49,790
FOR EVERY DAY
IT'S LATE.

118
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:53,210
WHY DIDN'T YOU DO
YOUR ASSIGNMENT?

119
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:56,046
I WENT TO TY'S
CHRISTENING.

120
00:04:57,297 --> 00:04:59,383
AND OUR BABY'S DOING GREAT
BY THE WAY.

121
00:04:59,466 --> 00:05:00,634
HE LIVES IN THIS
AMAZING NEIGHBOURHOOD,

122
00:05:00,717 --> 00:05:02,511
AND THE POWELL'S
ARE SO GOOD TO HIM.

123
00:05:02,594 --> 00:05:04,513
KNOCK IT OFF, KC.

124
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:06,557
DON'T YOU CARE
THAT YOUR SON'S

125
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:07,558
ADJUSTING
TO HIS NEW LIFE?

126
00:05:07,641 --> 00:05:08,559
OF COURSE I DO.

127
00:05:08,642 --> 00:05:11,812
MAYBE IF YOU SPEND
SOME TIME-
I CAN'T!

128
00:05:11,895 --> 00:05:14,648
HOW CAN YOU BE
SO SELFISH?

129
00:05:14,731 --> 00:05:16,066
YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO BARELY HELPED OUT

130
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:18,694
AFTER TY WAS BORN!

131
00:05:18,777 --> 00:05:20,737
WELL, I'M MAKING UP
FOR IT NOW!

132
00:05:20,821 --> 00:05:22,906
LOOK, TY NEEDS US,
JENNA.

133
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:25,158
YOU AND ME -
HIS PARENTS.

134
00:05:25,242 --> 00:05:27,286
WE'RE NOT HIS PARENTS
ANYMORE!

135
00:05:27,369 --> 00:05:28,871
MRS. COHEN:
CLASS!

136
00:05:29,913 --> 00:05:30,914
JENNA.

137
00:05:32,249 --> 00:05:33,250
(BELL RINGS)

138
00:05:34,501 --> 00:05:35,836
TORI:
ROAAAAAR!

139
00:05:36,837 --> 00:05:39,089
MARISOL:
COME ON, NINER,
LET'S HEAR ANOTHER ROAR.

140
00:05:39,173 --> 00:05:40,799
TORI:
ROAAAAAR!

141
00:05:40,883 --> 00:05:43,218
GUESS THAT'S WORTH A NICKEL.

142
00:05:47,764 --> 00:05:51,643
MAYA:
WHOA. IS THIS SOME BIZARRE
INITIATION RITUAL?

143
00:05:51,727 --> 00:05:52,436
I WAS LATE FOR PRACTICE

144
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:55,314
BECAUSE I WAS HELPING ZIG
WITH THAT VIDEO.

145
00:05:55,397 --> 00:05:57,774
THIS IS MY PUNISHMENT.

146
00:05:57,858 --> 00:05:59,526
THOUGHT CHEERLEADING WAS
REALLY IMPORTANT TO YOU.

147
00:05:59,610 --> 00:06:02,613
IT IS,
BUT ZIG NEEDED HELP.

148
00:06:02,696 --> 00:06:03,947
HE WOULD DO THE SAME
FOR ME.

149
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:07,492
THEN WHY ISN'T HE HERE
KEEPING YOU COMPANY?

150
00:06:07,576 --> 00:06:08,827
HE REALLY,
REALLY WANTED TO,

151
00:06:08,911 --> 00:06:11,455
BUT HE HAD
SKATEBOARDING PLANS.

152
00:06:11,538 --> 00:06:12,748
TORI, I'M SORRY,

153
00:06:12,831 --> 00:06:14,499
BUT IT SOUNDS LIKE
HIS SKATEBOARDING

154
00:06:14,583 --> 00:06:16,376
TAKES PRECEDENCE
OVER YOUR CHEERLEADING.

155
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:17,711
YOU DON'T KNOW
ANYTHING.

156
00:06:17,794 --> 00:06:19,796
MAYBE NOT, BUT...

157
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:21,340
I THOUGHT IT WAS COOL
HOW YOU STOOD UP TO MARISOL

158
00:06:21,423 --> 00:06:23,133
TO MAKE THE TEAM.

159
00:06:23,217 --> 00:06:25,302
WHY CAN'T YOU STAND UP
TO YOUR BOYFRIEND?

160
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:27,221
YOU'RE JUST JEALOUS
BECAUSE I HAVE A BOYFRIEND

161
00:06:27,304 --> 00:06:29,223
AND YOU DON'T.

162
00:06:29,306 --> 00:06:30,974
YEAH,
THAT MUST BE IT.

163
00:06:31,058 --> 00:06:32,893
BUT AS LONG
AS YOU'RE HAPPY...

164
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,773
ADAM:
PAWN SHOPS SMELL WEIRD.

165
00:06:37,856 --> 00:06:40,317
ELI:
AH, THE SCENT OF
IMPULSIVE BEHAVIOUR AND REGRET.

166
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,778
NOW I HAVE TO FIND A WAY
TO REPLACE IMOGEN'S CAMERA.

167
00:06:42,861 --> 00:06:44,321
A PROBLEM FOR ANOTHER DAY.

168
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:45,322
TONIGHT, WE CELEBRATE

169
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:47,824
WITH A WII BOXING MARATHON
IN MY BASEMENT.

170
00:06:47,908 --> 00:06:50,327
DREW'S ORDERING PIZZA.

171
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:51,787
ELI? HELLO?

172
00:06:53,205 --> 00:06:54,706
JAKE'S A PRETTY
GOOD LOOKING DUDE, RIGHT?

173
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:55,916
SINCE WHEN ARE YOU
INTO DUDES?

174
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:56,917
I THINK THERE'S
SOMETHING GOING ON

175
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,502
BETWEEN IMOGEN AND HIM.

176
00:06:58,585 --> 00:07:00,420
ISN'T JAKE WITH JENNA?

177
00:07:00,504 --> 00:07:03,257
IS HE?
WOW, DUDE MOVES FAST.

178
00:07:04,258 --> 00:07:07,469
HISTORY PROVES THAT WE HAVE
THE SAME TASTE IN GIRLS.

179
00:07:07,553 --> 00:07:09,221
YOU KNOW,
THAT EXPLAINS EVERYTHING:

180
00:07:09,304 --> 00:07:10,681
WHY SHE LIED TO ME
ABOUT WHERE SHE WAS;

181
00:07:10,764 --> 00:07:12,307
WHY SHE COULDN'T
COME OUT TONIGHT.

182
00:07:12,391 --> 00:07:14,184
WELL,
ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE.

183
00:07:14,268 --> 00:07:16,186
I HAVE TO FIND OUT THE TRUTH.
OTHERWISE, I'LL GO CRAZY.

184
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:17,187
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

185
00:07:17,271 --> 00:07:18,188
IF IMOGEN'S AT FIONA'S TONIGHT,

186
00:07:18,272 --> 00:07:19,189
THEN I HAVE NOTHING
TO WORRY ABOUT.

187
00:07:19,273 --> 00:07:20,274
ADAM:
WELL, THE MOMENT YOU WALK
THROUGH THAT DOOR,

188
00:07:20,357 --> 00:07:21,525
SHE'LL KNOW WHY
YOU'RE THERE.

189
00:07:22,776 --> 00:07:24,444
THEN I WON'T WALK
THROUGH THE DOOR.

190
00:07:27,489 --> 00:07:28,907
KC:
HEY, POWELL'S!

191
00:07:28,991 --> 00:07:31,243
ED:
KC, WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

192
00:07:31,326 --> 00:07:33,036
CATHY:
DID YOU FORGET SOMETHING
LAST NIGHT?

193
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:36,206
NO, JUST DROPPING BY
TO SPEND SOME TIME WITH TY.

194
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:37,457
I MEAN, DOUG.

195
00:07:37,541 --> 00:07:39,710
SORRY, THAT'LL TAKE SOME TIME
GETTING USED TO.

196
00:07:39,793 --> 00:07:41,086
ED:
YEAH, I WISH YOU'D CALLED.

197
00:07:41,170 --> 00:07:43,589
WE'RE OFF TO SEE
MY PARENTS.

198
00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:45,757
OH,
I COULD COME WITH.

199
00:07:45,841 --> 00:07:47,885
I'D LOVE TO MEET
THE REST OF THE FAMILY.

200
00:07:47,968 --> 00:07:50,179
UH, I DON'T THINK
THAT'S A GOOD IDEA.

201
00:07:50,262 --> 00:07:51,847
YEAH,
WE'LL GIVE YOU A CALL

202
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:54,057
AND WE'LL SET UP
ANOTHER TIME FOR VISIT.

203
00:07:54,141 --> 00:07:56,685
YEAH,
I'M FREE THIS WEEKEND.

204
00:07:56,768 --> 00:08:00,981
UH, WE'RE NOT,
BUT WE'LL BE IN TOUCH.

OKAY,
THIS IS FIONA'S BEDROOM.

214
00:08:33,847 --> 00:08:34,765
I HEAR A GUY.

215
00:08:34,848 --> 00:08:36,433
IMOGEN:
HE BROKE MY CAMERA,
WENT TO MY HOUSE,

216
00:08:36,517 --> 00:08:38,060
LEFT ME A MILLION MESSAGES.

217
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:40,771
GAVE ME A NEW CAMERA,
THEN TOOK IT BACK.

218
00:08:40,854 --> 00:08:42,397
I'M WORRIED
HE'S HAVING AN EPISODE,

219
00:08:42,481 --> 00:08:45,234
BUT HE DOESN'T WANNA DISCUSS
ANYTHING BIPOLAR.

220
00:08:45,317 --> 00:08:47,694
FIONA:
SO THAT'S WHY YOU'VE
BEEN HIDING OUT HERE?

221
00:08:47,778 --> 00:08:48,779
IS THAT OKAY?

222
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:52,115
I FEEL COMFORTABLE TALKING
TO YOU ABOUT ANYTHING.

223
00:08:52,199 --> 00:08:53,825
OF COURSE IT'S OKAY.

224
00:08:53,909 --> 00:08:55,827
BUT I REALLY THINK YOU SHOULD
GIVE ELI ANOTHER CHANCE.

225
00:08:55,911 --> 00:08:57,371
WE BOTH KNOW
HE'S AN AMAZING GUY.

226
00:08:57,454 --> 00:08:59,206
(LOUD SQUEAK AND THUD)

227
00:09:00,207 --> 00:09:01,124
DID YOU HEAR THAT?

228
00:09:01,208 --> 00:09:02,459
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?
SHHHHH.

229
00:09:02,543 --> 00:09:03,877
SERIOUSLY,
BREAKING AND ENTERING?

230
00:09:03,961 --> 00:09:05,420
DON'T YOU THINK YOU'RE GOING
A LITTLE OVERBOARD?

231
00:09:05,504 --> 00:09:07,798
I NEED TO CATCH HER
IN THE ACT.

232
00:09:07,881 --> 00:09:10,217
NOW ARE YOU COMING
OR NOT?

233
00:09:13,762 --> 00:09:15,305
IMOGEN:
THAT'S YOUR WEAPON SELECTION?!

234
00:09:15,389 --> 00:09:17,307
YOU HAVE A LAMP!

235
00:09:26,775 --> 00:09:27,818
AGHHHH!

236
00:09:27,901 --> 00:09:28,986
IMOGEN: ELI!
FIONA: ADAM?

237
00:09:29,987 --> 00:09:32,990
SNEAKING INTO PEOPLE'S HOUSES,
WHO DOES THAT?!

238
00:09:33,073 --> 00:09:33,991
WE WERE IN
THE NEIGHBOURHOOD

239
00:09:34,074 --> 00:09:36,702
SO WE THOUGHT WE'D DROP IN
AND SAY HI.

240
00:09:36,785 --> 00:09:38,620
ADAM:
HI.

241
00:09:38,704 --> 00:09:40,289
SO WHERE'S THE FRENCH GUY?

242
00:09:40,372 --> 00:09:42,749
FIONA:
WHAT? WE'RE WATCHING
A FRENCH MOVIE.

243
00:09:42,833 --> 00:09:44,793
IMOGEN:
YOU WERE SPYING ON US?

244
00:09:44,877 --> 00:09:45,878
OKAY, DON'T SAY THIS
IS A MANIC THING.

245
00:09:45,961 --> 00:09:47,504
THEN WHAT DO YOU
WANT ME TO SAY?

246
00:09:47,588 --> 00:09:51,592
BECAUSE EVERY TIME
I OPEN MY MOUTH IT'S WRONG.

247
00:09:51,675 --> 00:09:53,343
I DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW TO ACT
AROUND YOU ANYMORE!

248
00:09:53,427 --> 00:09:54,344
OKAY, BUT YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO LIED

249
00:09:54,428 --> 00:09:55,262
ABOUT WHERE YOU WERE
LAST NIGHT!

250
00:09:55,345 --> 00:09:57,890
I WAS HERE
DISCUSSING US WITH FIONA

251
00:09:57,973 --> 00:09:59,141
BECAUSE YOU WON'T.

252
00:09:59,224 --> 00:10:00,851
DO YOU BLAME ME?

253
00:10:00,934 --> 00:10:02,519
EVERY TIME I EXPRESS
AN EMOTION,

254
00:10:02,603 --> 00:10:04,688
YOU TRY TO TALK ME
OFF A LEDGE!

255
00:10:04,771 --> 00:10:06,064
I'M WORRIED ABOUT YOU.

256
00:10:06,148 --> 00:10:07,733
TELL HER I'M FINE.

257
00:10:07,816 --> 00:10:09,151
TELL HER!

258
00:10:09,234 --> 00:10:10,527
MAYBE WE SHOULD
JUST LET THE GIRLS

259
00:10:10,611 --> 00:10:11,612
HAVE THEIR MOVIE NIGHT.

260
00:10:14,448 --> 00:10:16,867
YEAH, GO TO HELL,
ALL OF YOU.

261
00:10:22,414 --> 00:10:24,082
(PICTURES TEAR)

262
00:10:26,001 --> 00:10:28,670
(DRAWERS RATTLE
AND BANG LOUDLY)

263
00:10:32,424 --> 00:10:33,175
(PANTING)

264
00:10:33,258 --> 00:10:34,968
BULLFROG:
IT'S 4:00 A.M.
WHAT THE HECK ARE YOU DOING?

265
00:10:35,052 --> 00:10:37,262
GETTING RID OF EVERYTHING
THAT REMINDS ME OF IMOGEN.

266
00:10:37,346 --> 00:10:38,597
YOUR FIRST EDITION SPAWN?

267
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:40,516
YEAH.
SHE TOUCHED IT ONCE.

268
00:10:40,599 --> 00:10:41,767
ELI...

269
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:42,768
NO. YOU WERE RIGHT.

270
00:10:42,851 --> 00:10:44,811
YOU KNOW, DATING IMOGEN
WAS A MISTAKE.

271
00:10:44,895 --> 00:10:45,812
I THOUGHT SHE GOT ME,

272
00:10:45,896 --> 00:10:47,731
BUT SHE'S JUST LIKE
EVERYONE ELSE.

273
00:10:47,814 --> 00:10:49,107
I HATE TO ASK THIS,
SOLDIER,

274
00:10:49,191 --> 00:10:52,027
BUT HAVE YOU BEEN
TAKING YOUR MEDS?

275
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:54,196
IT'S JUST THAT YOU SEEM
A LITTLE AGITATED.

276
00:10:54,279 --> 00:10:55,822
I'M FINE.
THIS ISN'T FINE!

277
00:10:56,823 --> 00:10:58,408
FIRST, YOU TAKE MY GUITAR
WITHOUT ASKING.

278
00:10:58,492 --> 00:11:00,369
I GOT IT BACK.
IT'S ON FIONA'S FIRE ESCAPE.

279
00:11:01,662 --> 00:11:03,288
AND THEN THIS...

280
00:11:11,338 --> 00:11:12,256
BUT I'VE BEEN DOING
EVERYTHING

281
00:11:12,339 --> 00:11:13,715
THE DOCTOR'S TOLD ME.

282
00:11:13,799 --> 00:11:16,552
IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT,
KIDDO.

283
00:11:17,719 --> 00:11:20,138
YOU HAVE AN ILLNESS.

284
00:11:20,222 --> 00:11:22,808
I'M GONNA CALL
DR. FRANK.

285
00:11:36,947 --> 00:11:38,615
WE NEED A LAWYER.

286
00:11:39,616 --> 00:11:40,909
LISA:
A LAWYER?

287
00:11:42,911 --> 00:11:45,873
THERE'S THIS CASE IN TEXAS
WHERE A BIOLOGICAL FATHER

288
00:11:45,956 --> 00:11:47,749
SUED THE ADOPTIVE PARENTS
FOR VISITATION

289
00:11:47,833 --> 00:11:49,501
AND WON.

290
00:11:49,585 --> 00:11:50,377
I KNOW IT
WILL BE EXPENSIVE,

291
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:51,378
BUT MAYBE WE CAN WORK
SOMETHING OUT

292
00:11:51,461 --> 00:11:52,588
WITH SOCIAL SERVICES.

293
00:11:52,671 --> 00:11:54,965
KC, WE'RE NOT INVOLVING
LAWYERS.

294
00:11:55,048 --> 00:11:56,633
WHEN THE ADOPTION
WENT THROUGH,

295
00:11:56,717 --> 00:11:58,177
THE POWELL'S SAID
YOU COULD VISIT

296
00:11:58,260 --> 00:11:59,678
A COUPLE TIMES A YEAR.

297
00:11:59,761 --> 00:12:00,846
THAT'S NOT ENOUGH!

298
00:12:00,929 --> 00:12:02,097
WELL,
IT'S GONNA HAVE TO BE...

299
00:12:02,181 --> 00:12:03,682
FOR NOW.

300
00:12:03,765 --> 00:12:04,975
AND I'LL ALWAYS BE
THE LOSER

301
00:12:05,058 --> 00:12:06,894
WHO GOT A GIRL PREGNANT

302
00:12:06,977 --> 00:12:08,478
AND COULDN'T HANDLE
THE RESPONSIBILITY?

303
00:12:08,562 --> 00:12:09,938
YOU'RE NOT.

304
00:12:10,022 --> 00:12:13,650
YOU'RE THE GUY WHO GAVE HIM
A CHANCE AT A BETTER LIFE.

305
00:12:13,734 --> 00:12:16,486
THAT'S NOT THE WAY
JENNA SEES ME!

306
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:19,072
MAYBE NOT RIGHT NOW.

307
00:12:19,156 --> 00:12:20,574
KC:
NO, SHE HATES ME!

308
00:12:24,536 --> 00:12:27,915
AND IF I CAN'T BE
A PART OF TY'S LIFE,

309
00:12:27,998 --> 00:12:30,083
HE'LL FEEL THE SAME WAY!

310
00:12:30,167 --> 00:12:33,045
WHEN YOU WERE LITTLE,
YOU WANTED TO BE A DOCTOR.

311
00:12:33,128 --> 00:12:34,046
I REMEMBER

312
00:12:34,129 --> 00:12:35,923
BECAUSE I BOUGHT YOU
A STETHOSCOPE.

313
00:12:36,006 --> 00:12:38,342
YEAH, LIKE A MILLION
YEARS AGO.

314
00:12:38,425 --> 00:12:40,761
I DIDN'T GIVE YOU
THE BEST LIFE, KC,

315
00:12:40,844 --> 00:12:41,845
I KNOW,

316
00:12:44,348 --> 00:12:47,434
(SIGHS)
BUT YOU CAN BE SOMEONE.

317
00:12:48,644 --> 00:12:51,230
SOMEONE TY CAN
LOOK UP TO.

318
00:12:56,652 --> 00:12:59,488
YOU MEAN SOMEONE DOUG
CAN LOOK UP TO?

319
00:12:59,571 --> 00:13:00,572
(LAUGHING)

320
00:13:01,198 --> 00:13:02,199
YEAH.

321
00:13:05,661 --> 00:13:07,120
P.A. ANNOUNCEMENT:
LET'S GET SOME FANS
IN THE STANDS.

322
00:13:07,204 --> 00:13:09,122
DON'T MISS THE PANTHERS
FOOTBALL TEAM IN ACTION

323
00:13:09,206 --> 00:13:10,624
TODAY AT BARDELL.

324
00:13:11,625 --> 00:13:13,085
HEY, ZIG.

325
00:13:13,168 --> 00:13:14,795
GUESS WHAT YOU'RE
DOING TODAY?

326
00:13:14,878 --> 00:13:15,963
I DON'T KNOW.

327
00:13:16,046 --> 00:13:19,550
COMING TO THE DEGRASSI
FOOTBALL GAME WITH ME!

328
00:13:19,633 --> 00:13:22,261
YOU KNOW THAT'S NOT
REALLY MY THING.

329
00:13:22,344 --> 00:13:23,262
BUT IT'S MY THING,

330
00:13:23,345 --> 00:13:25,097
AND I REALLY
WANT YOU THERE.

331
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:26,098
HONESTLY, TOR,

332
00:13:26,181 --> 00:13:28,934
I'D RATHER JUST GO
TO THE SKATE PARK.

333
00:13:32,437 --> 00:13:34,398
WHY WON'T YOU DO THIS
FOR ME?

334
00:13:34,481 --> 00:13:35,691
IT'S JUST A FOOTBALL GAME.

335
00:13:35,774 --> 00:13:36,900
IT'S WAY MORE THAN THAT.

336
00:13:36,984 --> 00:13:38,777
IT'S MY FIRST OFFICIAL
POWER SQUAD EVENT.

AS THE MASCOT.

338
00:13:40,195 --> 00:13:41,280
BECAUSE YOUR
SKATEBOARDING VIDEO

339
00:13:41,363 --> 00:13:42,781
MADE ME LATE
FOR PRACTICE.

340
00:13:42,865 --> 00:13:44,324
I DIDN'T MAKE YOU STAY.

341
00:13:44,408 --> 00:13:48,787
NO, I WANTED TO BECAUSE
IT WAS IMPORTANT TO YOU.

342
00:13:49,788 --> 00:13:53,458
NAME ONE THING
YOU'VE EVER DONE FOR ME.

343
00:13:57,212 --> 00:13:59,923
FINE,
I'LL GO TO YOUR GAME.

00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:19,401
UH...

350
00:14:19,484 --> 00:14:20,861
SO I WAS UP ALL NIGHT
TRASHING EVERYTHING

351
00:14:20,944 --> 00:14:22,988
THAT REMINDED ME
OF MY GIRLFRIEND.

352
00:14:23,071 --> 00:14:24,615
YOU AND IMOGEN
HAD A FIGHT?

353
00:14:24,698 --> 00:14:25,824
MY DAD WAS RIGHT.

354
00:14:25,908 --> 00:14:28,118
I'M NOT READY
FOR A RELATIONSHIP AND...

355
00:14:28,202 --> 00:14:30,162
ONE MISUNDERSTANDING
JUST THREW ME OFF THE EDGE.

356
00:14:30,245 --> 00:14:33,040
WHOA! NOW...
LET'S TALK ABOUT THIS.

357
00:14:33,123 --> 00:14:34,333
YOU KNOW,
CONSIDERING WE'RE HERE,

358
00:14:34,416 --> 00:14:35,918
HAVING THIS CONVERSATION,

359
00:14:36,001 --> 00:14:37,920
YOU MAY NOT BE
"OVER THE EDGE."

360
00:14:38,003 --> 00:14:41,798
NOW, ASIDE FROM LAST NIGHT,
HOW ARE YOU SLEEPING?

361
00:14:41,882 --> 00:14:43,008
GREAT.
GOOD.

362
00:14:43,091 --> 00:14:45,260
AND YOUR DIET...
AND YOUR EXERCISE,

363
00:14:45,344 --> 00:14:46,637
ARE YOU STICKING
WITH THE REGIMEN?

364
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:49,056
YEAH.
I'M ALL OVER IT.

365
00:14:50,265 --> 00:14:51,099
I DON'T REALLY THINK

366
00:14:51,183 --> 00:14:52,851
THAT YOU HAVE ANYTHING
TO WORRY ABOUT

367
00:14:52,935 --> 00:14:53,936
FOR THE TIME BEING.

368
00:14:54,019 --> 00:14:57,064
OKAY. THEN HOW DO YOU
EXPLAIN MY BEHAVIOUR?

369
00:14:57,147 --> 00:14:58,899
TEENAGE HORMONES.

370
00:14:58,982 --> 00:14:59,983
(SCOFFS)

371
00:15:00,984 --> 00:15:02,236
SO I'M NOT GOING CRAZY?

372
00:15:02,319 --> 00:15:05,113
ELI, YOU KNOW
I DON'T LIKE THAT WORD.

373
00:15:06,281 --> 00:15:07,616
OKAY, BUT THEN I SHOULD
PROBABLY STAY AWAY

374
00:15:07,699 --> 00:15:08,617
FROM GIRLS
FOR A LITTLE WHILE.

375
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:10,369
YOU KNOW,
AVOID TRIGGERS.

376
00:15:10,452 --> 00:15:12,579
HEARTBREAK HAPPENS,
ELI.

377
00:15:12,663 --> 00:15:16,959
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO LEARN
TO DEAL WITH IT.

378
00:15:17,042 --> 00:15:21,296
MRS. COHEN:
AND TOMORROW WE BEGIN OUR MODULE
ON ORGANIC EQUATIONS, EVERYONE.

379
00:15:23,298 --> 00:15:25,592
KC:
HERE'S MY ASSIGNMENT,
MRS. COHEN.

380
00:15:25,676 --> 00:15:27,719
A DAY LATE.
I'LL HAVE TO DOCK A GRADE.

381
00:15:27,803 --> 00:15:29,680
I KNOW,
I MESSED UP.

382
00:15:30,681 --> 00:15:31,849
I'VE BEEN DOING THAT
A LOT LATELY,

383
00:15:31,932 --> 00:15:34,017
BUT I'LL MAKE IT UP
ON THE NEXT ONE.

384
00:15:39,273 --> 00:15:40,566
I WANT TO APOLOGIZE.

385
00:15:40,649 --> 00:15:42,818
YOU HAVE 30 SECONDS.

386
00:15:46,196 --> 00:15:47,114
IF IT WEREN'T FOR YOU,

387
00:15:47,197 --> 00:15:50,409
WE'D STILL BE STRUGGLING
TO TAKE CARE OF A BABY...

388
00:15:50,492 --> 00:15:52,995
AND NOW WE CAN DO ANYTHING.

389
00:15:53,078 --> 00:15:55,539
IT'S JUST BEEN HARD FOR ME
TO MOVE ON.

390
00:15:55,622 --> 00:15:56,915
IT SEEMS SO EASY FOR YOU.

391
00:15:56,999 --> 00:15:58,292
IT'S NOT.

392
00:15:59,501 --> 00:16:02,171
I MISS HIM TOO,
EVERY DAY.

393
00:16:05,549 --> 00:16:08,719
WELL, MAYBE ONE DAY
WE CAN VISIT DOUG TOGETHER.

394
00:16:08,802 --> 00:16:10,053
DOUG?

395
00:16:10,137 --> 00:16:12,472
YEAH, THAT'S WHAT
THEY CALL TY NOW.

396
00:16:12,556 --> 00:16:13,891
HMM...

397
00:16:15,517 --> 00:16:18,061
I DON'T KNOW
WHEN I'LL BE READY.

398
00:16:18,145 --> 00:16:20,230
MRS. COHEN:
KC, MAY I HAVE A WORD
WITH YOU?

399
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:23,984
SEE YOU AROUND?

400
00:16:28,697 --> 00:16:30,032
UH, I'D LIKE TO DISCUSS
YOUR ANSWER

401
00:16:30,115 --> 00:16:32,409
TO NUMBER THREE.

402
00:16:32,492 --> 00:16:34,453
DID I GET IT WRONG?

403
00:16:34,536 --> 00:16:35,454
YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE
IN THE CLASS

404
00:16:35,537 --> 00:16:37,206
WHO GOT IT RIGHT.

405
00:16:37,289 --> 00:16:38,207
I MIGHT HAVE A WAY
FOR YOU

406
00:16:38,290 --> 00:16:40,959
TO MAKE UP
THOSE EXTRA MARKS,

407
00:16:41,043 --> 00:16:43,128
IF YOU'RE INTERESTED.

408
00:16:43,212 --> 00:16:44,213
SURE.

409
00:16:48,217 --> 00:16:49,468
TORI:
SORRY, I'M LATE.

410
00:16:49,551 --> 00:16:51,220
I COULDN'T FIND
THE MASCOT COSTUME.

411
00:16:51,303 --> 00:16:52,221
I LOOKED EVERYWHERE-

412
00:16:52,304 --> 00:16:54,765
MARISOL:
IT'S OKAY,
I FOUND A REPLACEMENT.

413
00:16:54,848 --> 00:16:56,934
DOES THAT MEAN
I'M NOT ON THE TEAM?!

414
00:16:57,017 --> 00:16:59,144
IT MEANS YOU NEED
TO GET DRESSED

415
00:16:59,228 --> 00:17:01,563
BECAUSE THE BUS
LEAVES IN FIVE.

416
00:17:01,647 --> 00:17:02,940
DRESSED?

417
00:17:03,023 --> 00:17:04,650
LIKE IN MY POWER SQUAD
UNIFORM?

418
00:17:04,733 --> 00:17:08,111
"LIKE IN YOUR POWER SQUAD
UNIFORM."

419
00:17:08,904 --> 00:17:10,405
WHO'S THE MASCOT?

420
00:17:10,489 --> 00:17:11,573
SOME NINER GUY.

421
00:17:21,166 --> 00:17:22,668
WHOA... WHEW...

422
00:17:25,295 --> 00:17:27,130
THOUGHT FOOTBALL GAMES
WEREN'T YOUR THING?

423
00:17:27,214 --> 00:17:28,131
WELL...

424
00:17:28,215 --> 00:17:31,510
MARISOL SAID AS LONG AS I WEAR
THIS SMELLY OUTFIT,

425
00:17:31,593 --> 00:17:33,011
YOU DON'T HAVE TO.

426
00:17:33,095 --> 00:17:34,513
SO YOU THINK YOU CAN DO
ONE NICE THING

427
00:17:34,596 --> 00:17:36,849
AND I'LL JUST FORGIVE YOU?

428
00:17:36,932 --> 00:17:39,226
WELL, I WAS KIND OF
HOPING SO.

429
00:17:40,227 --> 00:17:42,646
WELL, IT'S NOT GOING TO WORK
LIKE THAT ANYMORE.

430
00:17:42,729 --> 00:17:44,898
THINGS NEED TO CHANGE.

431
00:17:44,982 --> 00:17:45,983
OKAY.

432
00:17:47,025 --> 00:17:48,652
I'LL TRY HARDER.

433
00:17:49,653 --> 00:17:50,654
SO UH...

434
00:17:52,072 --> 00:17:53,907
DO I GET A KISS?

435
00:17:55,367 --> 00:17:57,244
NOT WHILE YOU'RE WEARING
THAT STINKY OUTFIT.

436
00:17:57,327 --> 00:17:58,328
(PRETEND OFFENDED GASP)

437
00:18:11,008 --> 00:18:13,635
HEY.
THANKS FOR MEETING ME.

438
00:18:14,636 --> 00:18:16,388
WHAT'S THIS?

439
00:18:16,471 --> 00:18:17,806
MY ART PROJECT.

440
00:18:18,807 --> 00:18:19,892
I TOOK IT DOWN

441
00:18:19,975 --> 00:18:22,519
AND WITHDREW IT
FROM THE ART COMPETITION.

442
00:18:22,603 --> 00:18:23,854
FOR ME.

443
00:18:25,606 --> 00:18:27,524
CAN I TAKE IT?

444
00:18:27,608 --> 00:18:29,067
I THOUGHT YOU HATED IT.

445
00:18:29,151 --> 00:18:32,029
WELL, I'VE BEEN DOING
A LOT OF THINKING.

446
00:18:38,869 --> 00:18:41,622
BREAKING INTO FIONA'S CONDO
WASN'T MY FINEST MOMENT.

447
00:18:42,247 --> 00:18:43,248
I JUST DIDN'T WANT
TO LOSE ANOTHER GIRL

448
00:18:43,332 --> 00:18:44,791
BECAUSE OF MY CONDITION.

449
00:18:44,875 --> 00:18:46,335
I'M SORRY.

450
00:18:46,418 --> 00:18:47,336
YOU SCARED ME.

451
00:18:47,419 --> 00:18:49,296
YEAH, I SCARED MYSELF.

452
00:18:51,298 --> 00:18:53,383
BUT THE GOOD THING IS

453
00:18:53,383 --> 00:18:54,343
I WASN'T HAVING
A MANIC EPISODE.

454
00:18:54,343 --> 00:18:55,761
JUST GOOD, OLD-FASHIONED
PARANOID JEALOUSY.

455
00:18:55,844 --> 00:18:59,765
I SPENT A YEAR
FANTASIZING ABOUT YOU,

456
00:18:59,848 --> 00:19:02,017
DREAMING ABOUT BEING
YOUR GIRLFRIEND.

457
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:04,937
BUT NOW THAT
WE'RE TOGETHER,

458
00:19:05,938 --> 00:19:08,023
IT'S LIKE
I BARELY KNOW YOU.

459
00:19:08,106 --> 00:19:10,692
OR YOU KNOW ME
TOO WELL...

460
00:19:11,693 --> 00:19:16,198
I DON'T THINK YOU AND I
ARE GOOD FOR EACH OTHER.

461
00:19:18,992 --> 00:19:22,079
WE WERE...
WHEN WE WERE FRIENDS.

462
00:19:23,413 --> 00:19:26,333
OR DID I MESS THAT UP,
TOO?

463
00:19:33,048 --> 00:19:35,092
CONNOR:
0.14 KILOGRAM BASEBALL

464
00:19:35,175 --> 00:19:37,177
WITH A SPEED OF 40 METRES
PER SECOND IS CAUGHT.

465
00:19:37,261 --> 00:19:39,388
IF ITS ENERGY'S ABSORBED
BY THE BALL,

466
00:19:39,471 --> 00:19:41,974
WHAT'S THE TEMPERATURE CHANGE?

467
00:19:43,851 --> 00:19:45,394
0.8 DEGREES CELSIUS?

468
00:19:46,395 --> 00:19:47,312
I THINK WE'VE FOUND
THE FINAL MEMBER

469
00:19:47,396 --> 00:19:48,689
OF OUR SCIENCE OLYMPICS TEAM!

470
00:19:48,772 --> 00:19:49,690
(APPLAUSE)

471
00:19:49,773 --> 00:19:51,108
WEREN'T YOU GUYS CITY CHAMPS
LAST YEAR?

472
00:19:51,191 --> 00:19:52,359
YEP, AND WE WILL BE AGAIN.

473
00:19:52,442 --> 00:19:54,111
SO DON'T MESS UP.

474
00:19:55,112 --> 00:19:56,780
KC, ARE YOU SURE
YOU'LL HAVE TIME?

475
00:19:56,864 --> 00:19:59,408
I MEAN, YOU'RE ALWAYS VISITING
THAT BABY OF YOURS.

476
00:19:59,491 --> 00:20:03,161
DOUG DOESN'T NEED
HIS BIO-DAD RIGHT NOW.

477
00:20:03,245 --> 00:20:06,874
BIO-DAD.
SOUNDS LIKE A SUPER HERO.

478
00:20:06,957 --> 00:20:09,459
YEAH, MAYBE ONE DAY
HE'LL THINK THAT.

479
00:20:09,543 --> 00:20:11,170
MRS. COHEN:
CONNOR?

480
00:20:11,253 --> 00:20:12,754
CONNOR:
ARE YOU GUYS READY
FOR THE NEXT QUESTION?

481
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:21,221
OKAY, SO AN ATOMIC LEVEL SPECIES

482
00:20:21,305 --> 00:20:25,142
IS FOUND TO CONTAIN 16 PROTONS,
16 NEUTRONS AND 18 ELECTRONS.

483
00:20:25,225 --> 00:20:27,102
THE SPECIES IS
BEST DESCRIBED AS...?

484
00:20:27,186 --> 00:20:30,105
♪ You kissed me on
the summer's edge ♪

485
00:20:30,189 --> 00:20:32,316
♪ And oh your mother's words
would always sting the worst ♪

486
00:20:32,399 --> 00:20:33,400
(KNOCKING)

487
00:20:35,736 --> 00:20:36,987
WHAT ARE YOU SMILING ABOUT?

488
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:38,822
I'M JUST HAPPY
YOU'RE HAPPY.

489
00:20:38,906 --> 00:20:40,365
DR. FRANK AND I TALKED,

490
00:20:40,449 --> 00:20:44,828
AND APPARENTLY I'M NOT SUPPOSED
TO STOP YOU FROM DATING.

491
00:20:44,912 --> 00:20:47,039
YEAH, WELL, THAT'S NOT REALLY
AN ISSUE ANYMORE.

492
00:20:47,122 --> 00:20:48,040
SUPER SINGLE.

493
00:20:48,123 --> 00:20:50,334
BULLFROG:
(SIGHS, SORRY) OH...
ARE YOU SURE?

494
00:20:50,417 --> 00:20:52,252
'CAUSE THERE'S SOMEONE
HERE TO SEE YOU.

495
00:20:55,631 --> 00:20:56,798
OH, HEY.

496
00:20:56,882 --> 00:20:58,008
BAD TIME?

497
00:20:58,091 --> 00:21:00,969
ELI:
NO. NO,
JUST KEEP YOUR DISTANCE.

498
00:21:01,053 --> 00:21:02,346
IMOGEN:
SO I GOT A CALL

499
00:21:02,429 --> 00:21:04,681
FROM THE ONTARIO YOUTH
ART COMPETITION.

500
00:21:04,765 --> 00:21:06,642
AND APPARENTLY
I'M IN THE RUNNING

501
00:21:06,725 --> 00:21:08,810
FOR THE EMERGING ARTIST AWARD.

502
00:21:08,894 --> 00:21:10,687
OH GOOD,
THEY GOT IT.

503
00:21:10,771 --> 00:21:12,356
YOU SENT IN MY COLLAGE.

504
00:21:12,439 --> 00:21:14,566
IT'S A VERY NICE
PIECE OF ART.

505
00:21:15,567 --> 00:21:17,528
I DIDN'T MEAN TO MAKE YOU
A POSTER CHILD.

506
00:21:17,611 --> 00:21:19,029
WELL, IF IT SHOWS
THAT MENTAL ILLNESS

507
00:21:19,112 --> 00:21:20,697
DOESN'T HAVE TO BE
A STIGMA,

508
00:21:20,781 --> 00:21:21,949
WHY NOT?

509
00:21:22,032 --> 00:21:23,075
YOU HUNGRY?
WANNA GRAB BURRITOS?

510
00:21:23,158 --> 00:21:25,744
MMM...
THEY MAKE ME GASSY.

511
00:21:25,827 --> 00:21:26,870
YEAH. ME TOO.

512
00:21:26,954 --> 00:21:27,955
GOOD THING
WE'RE NOT DATING.

513
00:21:28,038 --> 00:21:29,289
(LAUGHING)

514
00:21:29,373 --> 00:21:29,873
ALL RIGHT,
IT'S ON ME,

515
00:21:29,957 --> 00:21:32,709
AND I STILL HAVE
TO REPLACE YOUR CAMERA.

516
00:21:32,793 --> 00:21:36,213
GO SHOWER, FRIEND.
I'M STARVED.

517
00:21:36,296 --> 00:21:37,714
I'LL LEAVE YOU ALONE
TO GET NAKED.

518
00:21:37,798 --> 00:21:38,715
NO, NO. STAY.

519
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:40,884
SINCE WE'RE NOT DATING,
IT SHOULDN'T MATTER.

520
00:21:40,968 --> 00:21:42,177
FUNNY!

521
00:21:42,261 --> 00:21:43,262
BOTH:
