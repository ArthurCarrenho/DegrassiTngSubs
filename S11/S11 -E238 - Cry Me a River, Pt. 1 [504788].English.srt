127
00:04:46,954 --> 00:04:48,455
NO ADJECTIVES,
NO ADVERBS.

128
00:04:48,539 --> 00:04:51,041
GREAT. WHAT SHOULD
THE ARTICLE BE ABOUT?

129
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:52,251
HOW ABOUT...

00:05:06,223 --> 00:05:08,141
I CAN'T BELIEVE GRAD PHOTO DAY
IS HERE!

138
00:05:08,225 --> 00:05:09,142
ONE OF THE LAST STOPS
ON THE WAY

139
00:05:09,226 --> 00:05:10,811
TO THE REST OF MY LIFE!

140
00:05:10,894 --> 00:05:13,605
WELL, DON'T BE IN TOO MUCH
OF A HURRY TO DITCH ME, OKAY?

141
00:05:13,689 --> 00:05:16,191
I'M GONNA BE ALL BY MYSELF
NEXT YEAR!

142
00:05:16,275 --> 00:05:17,901
WHO WILL PROOFREAD
MY ESSAYS?

143
00:05:17,985 --> 00:05:19,945
WHO WILL I GOSSIP WITH ME
IN BETWEEN CLASSES?

144
00:05:20,028 --> 00:05:22,281
SPEAKING OF CLASS,
SHOULDN'T YOU BE IN DRAMA?

145
00:05:22,364 --> 00:05:24,324
YEAH,
BUT WE GOT OUT EARLY.

146
00:05:25,409 --> 00:05:26,702
OKAY, I GOT OUT EARLY.

147
00:05:26,785 --> 00:05:29,162
BUT IT WAS FILLED
WITH GRADE ELEVENS -

148
00:05:29,246 --> 00:05:31,290
UNFRIENDLY, RHYMING ONES.

149
00:05:31,373 --> 00:05:32,499
ONCE THEY SEE WHAT
A DRAMA QUEEN YOU ARE,

150
00:05:32,583 --> 00:05:34,585
THEY'LL LOVE YOU!

151
00:05:34,668 --> 00:05:36,461
FIONA:
HOLLY J, YOU KNOW I HAVE TROUBLE
MAKING FRIENDS.

152
00:05:36,545 --> 00:05:38,922
EVEN YOU I INHERITED
FROM DECLAN.

153
00:05:39,006 --> 00:05:40,007
WHAT ABOUT CHARLIE?

154
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:42,217
WEREN'T YOU GUYS
ON THE FRIEND PATH?

155
00:05:42,301 --> 00:05:44,261
YEAH, BUT WE HAVEN'T SPENT
MUCH TIME TOGETHER

156
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:45,387
SINCE SPRING BREAK.

157
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:46,388
YOU CAN'T MAKE FRIENDS
WITH SOMEONE

158
00:05:46,471 --> 00:05:48,640
UNLESS YOU SPEND TIME
WITH THEM!

159
00:05:49,641 --> 00:05:50,642
YEAH...

160
00:05:51,727 --> 00:05:54,897
YOU KNOW, HOLLY J,
YOU MIGHT BE RIGHT.

161
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:56,648

OF ALL PEOPLE.

168
00:06:06,033 --> 00:06:07,618
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
"OF ALL PEOPLE"?

169
00:06:07,701 --> 00:06:09,828
WELL, HOW'S HE SUPPOSED
TO HOST A MAN SHOW?

170
00:06:09,912 --> 00:06:11,538
BECAUSE HE'S TRANSGENDERED?

171
00:06:11,622 --> 00:06:13,248
YEAH, IT'S WEIRD.

172
00:06:13,332 --> 00:06:14,750
ADAM'S NICE.

173
00:06:14,833 --> 00:06:16,710
YOU THINK EVERYONE'S NICE.

174
00:06:16,793 --> 00:06:17,711
WHAT?

175
00:06:17,794 --> 00:06:18,712
SADIE:
MY LOCKER'S NEAR ADAM'S,

176
00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:20,672
AND I HEAR HIM TALKING
TO HIS FRIENDS SOMETIMES.

177
00:06:20,756 --> 00:06:21,673

529
00:20:33,901 --> 00:20:35,152
HEY, IS DAVE ALMOST HERE?

530
00:20:35,235 --> 00:20:37,279
UM... YEAH,
ANY-ANY MINUTE NOW.

531
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:40,824
I CAN'T WAIT TO HEAR YOU GUYS
TOP YESTERDAY'S SHOW.

532
00:20:40,908 --> 00:20:42,910
FOR SURE,
IT'LL BE SICK.

533
00:20:45,204 --> 00:20:46,205
HEY.

534
00:20:51,210 --> 00:20:53,879
HEY, I'M-I'M STILL REALLY SORRY
ABOUT YESTERDAY.

535
00:20:53,962 --> 00:20:56,465
YEAH,
LET'S JUST DO THE SHOW.

536
00:20:56,548 --> 00:20:58,509
YEAH, WE'RE BOTH MEN.

537
00:20:58,592 --> 00:20:59,885
WHO NEEDS TO TALK,
RIGHT?

538
00:20:59,968 --> 00:21:01,178
MAYBE THAT CAN BE THE TOPIC.

539
00:21:02,304 --> 00:21:04,389
HEY DEGRASSI,
WELCOME TO "MANO A MANO"

540
00:21:04,473 --> 00:21:05,974
WITH DAVE AND ADAM!

541
00:21:06,058 --> 00:21:06,975
LET ME TELL YOU,

542
00:21:07,059 --> 00:21:08,310
IT DOES NOT SMELL GOOD
IN THE BOOTH TODAY,

543
00:21:08,393 --> 00:21:10,312
SO LAY OFF THE BURRITOS
OUT THERE!

544
00:21:10,395 --> 00:21:11,396
(FORCED LAUGH)

545
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:13,899
WHAT I WANT TO TALK ABOUT TODAY
IS BATHROOM RULES.

546
00:21:13,982 --> 00:21:16,151
NOW, NOT TO GET
ALL POLITICALLY INCORRECT,

547
00:21:16,235 --> 00:21:18,153
BUT SHOULD GIRLS
BE ALLOWED

548
00:21:18,237 --> 00:21:20,572
TO USE THE GUYS' BATHROOM
AT SCHOOL?

549
00:21:20,656 --> 00:21:21,823
SAV:
DAVE, SERIOUSLY, WATCH IT!

550
00:21:21,907 --> 00:21:23,408
DAVE:
BECAUSE HOW I SEE IT IS,
I MEAN...

551
00:21:23,492 --> 00:21:24,409
YOU'RE IN THERE
DOING YOUR THING,

552
00:21:24,493 --> 00:21:25,827
AND ALL OF A SUDDEN

553
00:21:25,911 --> 00:21:27,621
THERE'S A TRANNY
STARING AT YOUR JUNK!

554
00:21:27,704 --> 00:21:29,081
SAV:
DAVE!

555
00:21:29,164 --> 00:21:30,082
WHY IS THIS COOL?

556
00:21:30,165 --> 00:21:32,584
(CUTS TO A SONG)
THAT'S IT, I'M CUTTING YOU OFF.

557
00:21:32,668 --> 00:21:33,669
DAVE:
TEXT ME.

558
00:21:36,588 --> 00:21:38,507
LET ME KNOW
WHAT YOU THINK.

559
00:21:42,553 --> 00:21:43,846
NOT COOL, DAVE.
