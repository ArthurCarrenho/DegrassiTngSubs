SO THIS IS YOUR SCHOOL.

00:00:04,796 --> 00:00:07,090
CLARE:
YEP. BACK TO REALITY.

3
00:00:07,174 --> 00:00:08,175
THANKS FOR THE COFFEE,
SUMMER.

4
00:00:08,258 --> 00:00:10,219
SUMMER:
WELL, YOU GOTTA CAFFEINE UP
BEFORE SCHOOL, RIGHT?

5
00:00:10,302 --> 00:00:13,305
SUMMER, THANKS FOR LETTING ME
CRASH AT YOUR HOUSE LAST NIGHT.

6
00:00:13,388 --> 00:00:15,599
ESCAPING MY FAMILY ANGST,
TALKING TO NEW PEOPLE,

7
00:00:15,682 --> 00:00:16,934
IT'S EXACTLY WHAT I NEEDED.

8
00:00:17,017 --> 00:00:18,477
I FEEL ENERGIZED.

9
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:21,355
GREAT! BUT...?

10
00:00:22,397 --> 00:00:24,149
I DON'T KNOW
HOW REALISTIC IT IS

11
00:00:24,233 --> 00:00:26,401
TO KEEP STAYING WITH YOU
AND CASH.

12
00:00:26,485 --> 00:00:27,861
WHEN MY MOM FINDS OUT
I'M NOT AT MY DAD'S,

13
00:00:27,945 --> 00:00:28,946
SHE'LL FREAK.

14
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:30,447
WHAT SHE DOESN'T KNOW
WON'T HURT HER.

15
00:00:30,531 --> 00:00:31,823
I CAN'T LIE TO HER.

16
00:00:31,907 --> 00:00:34,159
IT'S JUST KEEPING UP
A CHARADE.

17
00:00:34,243 --> 00:00:36,745
YEAH, WHICH IS FRENCH
FOR LYING.

18
00:00:36,828 --> 00:00:37,788
SOMEONE'S GONNA
FIGURE IT OUT.

19
00:00:37,871 --> 00:00:39,581
MY MOM AND DAD WILL
EVENTUALLY COMPARE NOTES.

20
00:00:39,665 --> 00:00:40,749
AND WHEN THAT HAPPENS,

21
00:00:40,832 --> 00:00:43,210
THEY'LL PROBABLY BE
COOL WITH IT.

22
00:00:43,293 --> 00:00:45,462
MY MOM WANTS ME AT HOME.

23
00:00:45,546 --> 00:00:49,091
MAYBE I JUST HAVE TO
TRY HARDER TO FIT IN.

24
00:00:49,174 --> 00:00:50,300
OKAY.

25
00:00:50,384 --> 00:00:52,636
TRY AND TRY
AND TRY AGAIN.

26
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:55,681
KEEP THE NEGATIVE ENERGY
AROUND YOU.

27
00:00:55,764 --> 00:00:57,140
IT'S UP TO YOU,

28
00:00:57,224 --> 00:00:58,559
BUT I'M GONNA FEEL
SO SAD

29
00:00:58,642 --> 00:01:00,644

UH, NOW, ELI.

68
00:02:32,402 --> 00:02:34,404
HE TOLD ME THAT HE'S READY
TO TAKE YOUR RELATIONSHIP

69
00:02:34,488 --> 00:02:36,240
TO THE NEXT LEVEL.

70
00:02:36,323 --> 00:02:38,909
WHY WERE YOU TALKING
TO HIM ABOUT ME?

71
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:41,245
UH, YOUR NAME
JUST CASUALLY CAME UP.

72
00:02:41,328 --> 00:02:44,122
SO I ASKED HIM
AND HE'S VERY INTO YOU!

73
00:02:44,206 --> 00:02:45,749
REALLY?

74
00:02:45,832 --> 00:02:47,376

JUST FRIENDS.

MISSED IT, SORRY.

80
00:02:57,135 --> 00:02:58,637
HOW WAS DINNER LAST NIGHT
AT YOUR DAD'S?

81
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,180
PERFECT.
ILLUMINATING.

(AMUSED)
ILLUMINATING!

83
00:03:01,473 --> 00:03:03,016
I'M NOT STARTING FIGHTS
AT THE DINNER TABLE.

84
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:04,393
YOU AND JENNA CAN HANG OUT
ALL YOU WANT.

85
00:03:04,476 --> 00:03:05,727
THIS IS THE BEST SOLUTION
FOR EVERYONE.

86
00:03:05,811 --> 00:03:06,728
NOT FOR YOUR MOM.

87
00:03:06,812 --> 00:03:10,065
SHE SPENT
ALL LAST NIGHT CRYING.

88
00:03:13,861 --> 00:03:14,862
SHE DID?

89
00:03:17,865 --> 00:03:20,784
I'LL GO HOME AT LUNCH
AND I'LL TALK TO HER, OKAY?

90
00:03:20,868 --> 00:03:21,869
OKAY.

91
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:29,543

00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:34,339
BETTER THAN OKAY.

94
00:03:34,423 --> 00:03:37,384
I HAVE THE PERFECT WAY
TO PRANK MO.

95
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:41,138
IS THAT WHY YOU'RE LOGGED
INTO FACERANGE AS "TERESA"

96
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:43,473
AND YOUR PROFILE PIC
IS A SULTRY BRUNETTE?

97
00:03:43,557 --> 00:03:44,474
I SET UP THIS FAKE ACCOUNT

98
00:03:44,558 --> 00:03:46,059
AND POSTED A FLIRTY MESSAGE
ON MO'S WALL.

99
00:03:46,143 --> 00:03:48,812
IT TOOK HIM LESS THAN
22 MINUTES TO RESPOND.

100
00:03:48,896 --> 00:03:51,106
MO AND "TERESA"
ARE CHATTING AS WE SPEAK.

101
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:53,692
MO IS NOT GONNA FALL
FOR A FAKE ONLINE GIRL.

102
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:01,658
NEVER MIND.

103
00:04:01,742 --> 00:04:03,493
HE'S SPEWING RAINBOWS
OVER THERE.

104
00:04:03,577 --> 00:04:04,578
AND NOW FOR THE KICKER.

105
00:04:05,579 --> 00:04:08,582
AFTER SCHOOL, TOMORROW,

SMILEY FACE,

107

SMILEY WINKY FACE.

108
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:17,090
YES!

109
00:04:22,471 --> 00:04:25,182
WE HAVE THE SEASON OPENER
TOMORROW AFTER SCHOOL.

110
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:27,476
EXACTLY. A GAME MO'S
NOT GONNA BE AT.

111
00:04:27,559 --> 00:04:30,187
AND WHAT HAPPENS WHEN MO
FINDS OUT "TERESA" ISN'T REAL?

112
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:31,438
IT'S A PRANK.

113
00:04:32,564 --> 00:04:33,607
WELL, AFTER HE MADE
FUN OF YOU

114
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:35,692
IN FRONT OF
THE WHOLE TEAM,

115
00:04:35,776 --> 00:04:37,402
SEEMS MORE LIKE REVENGE.

00:04:46,495 --> 00:04:49,665
CLARE, WHY AREN'T YOU
AT SCHOOL?

118
00:04:52,835 --> 00:04:55,337
JAKE SAID YOU WERE UPSET
AFTER I LEFT LAST NIGHT.

119
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:56,797
OF COURSE I WAS.

120
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,382
YOU'VE SPENT PRACTICALLY
EVERY NIGHT OF YOUR LIFE

IN THIS HOUSE,

122
00:04:59,466 --> 00:05:01,385
AND TO HAVE YOU LEAVE
LIKE THAT,

123
00:05:01,468 --> 00:05:03,720
SO ANGRY AT ME...

124
00:05:03,804 --> 00:05:07,224
I'M SORRY,
I DIDN'T MEAN TO HURT YOU.

125
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:09,935
I JUST NEEDED
SOME SPACE.

126
00:05:10,018 --> 00:05:12,396
LIVING HERE IS
REALLY HARD FOR ME.

127
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:14,231
I SEE THAT NOW.

128
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:15,232
I AM SO SORRY

129
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:16,650
THAT I WAS INSENSITIVE
TO YOU LAST NIGHT.

130
00:05:16,733 --> 00:05:18,569
I'M SORRY, TOO.

IN TIME, WE'LL GET USED
TO THE IDEA.

132
00:05:27,703 --> 00:05:28,745
USED TO THE IDEA?

133
00:05:28,829 --> 00:05:30,414
THIS KILLS ME
BUT...

134
00:05:30,497 --> 00:05:32,040
MAYBE IT IS BEST
IF YOU STAY WITH YOUR DAD

135
00:05:32,124 --> 00:05:33,709
FOR A WHILE.

136

I-I THOUGHT YOU
WANTED ME HOME.

137
00:05:36,503 --> 00:05:38,213
I CAN SEE THAT
YOU'RE NOT HAPPY.

138
00:05:38,297 --> 00:05:39,256
BEING AWAY FROM HERE

139
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:40,966
MIGHT HELP YOU
GET SOME CLARITY,

140
00:05:41,049 --> 00:05:41,967
AND IN TIME

141
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:44,344
YOU'LL START TO SEE JAKE
AS YOUR STEPBROTHER.

142
00:05:44,428 --> 00:05:46,555
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

143
00:05:46,638 --> 00:05:49,766
OKAY,
I GUESS WE'LL TRY IT.

144
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:50,851

UM, SORRY,

154

BUT...SURPRISE!

156
00:06:26,887 --> 00:06:29,056
SO JUST SIT RIGHT DOWN

157
00:06:29,139 --> 00:06:31,183
AND ENJOY THE PICNIC
AND EACH OTHER.

158
00:06:31,266 --> 00:06:32,893
I'LL LEAVE YOU ALONE.

SUMMER:
CLARE, YOU SHOULD KNOW
WE HAVE A DINNER TRADITION.

183
00:07:37,082 --> 00:07:39,042
IT'S LIKE A SHARE CIRCLE

184
00:07:39,126 --> 00:07:42,629
WHERE EVERYBODY
TAKES TURNS SHARING.

185
00:07:46,383 --> 00:07:47,801
AND IT'S MY TURN,
ISN'T IT?

186
00:07:47,885 --> 00:07:49,553
UH, YEAH.
SORRY, NEWB.

187
00:07:49,636 --> 00:07:51,221
SUMMER LIKES TO PUT PEOPLE
ON THE SPOT.

188
00:07:51,305 --> 00:07:53,390
IT'S KIND OF HER THING.

189
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:55,058
WELL, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU WANT ME TO SAY.

190
00:07:55,142 --> 00:07:56,852
JUST TALK ABOUT YOU.

191
00:07:57,853 --> 00:07:59,855
WELL...

192
00:08:01,398 --> 00:08:05,444
WHEN MY PARENTS FIRST TOLD ME
THEY WERE SEPARATING,

193
00:08:05,527 --> 00:08:07,821
EVERYTHING I'VE EVER KNOWN -

194
00:08:07,905 --> 00:08:10,532
MY FAMILY, THE CHURCH -

195
00:08:10,616 --> 00:08:12,451
IT ALL FEELS...

196
00:08:14,161 --> 00:08:16,330
I FEEL LOST.

197
00:08:19,917 --> 00:08:23,504
AND THERE ARE NO ANSWERS,
JUST QUESTIONS.

198
00:08:25,672 --> 00:08:28,091
AND NOW I'M COMPLETELY ALONE.

199
00:08:31,011 --> 00:08:33,847
NO, YOU'RE NOT.
YOU HAVE US.

200
00:08:35,516 --> 00:08:38,936
CASH:
YEAH. AND UNFORTUNATELY,
WE HAVE WORK TO DO.

201
00:08:39,019 --> 00:08:40,145
CLARE:
WORK? NOW?

202
00:08:41,146 --> 00:08:45,817
CASH:
BUT IF WE ALL CHIP IN
WE'LL BE DONE IN NO TIME.

203
00:08:45,901 --> 00:08:47,653
UH, WELL,
WHAT CAN I DO TO HELP?

204
00:08:47,736 --> 00:08:49,404

YOU WANT TO?

205
00:08:50,531 --> 00:08:51,532
COME WITH ME.

00:09:02,167 --> 00:09:03,627

DEALERS?

212
00:09:14,388 --> 00:09:15,806
WE'RE HERBALISTS.

213
00:09:15,889 --> 00:09:16,807
OH.
WELL, IN THAT CASE.

214
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:19,476

THIS IS HOW WE PAY BILLS
AND PUT FOOD ON THE TABLE

215
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:23,230
SO THAT CASH AND I CAN HELP OUT
TROUBLED TEENS LIKE YOU.

PLEASE TELL ME
YOU'LL STAY.

I'M SO SORRY
I WAS MEAN TO YOU LAST NIGHT.

237
00:10:20,579 --> 00:10:22,581
I SHOULDN'T HAVE PUSHED
YOU AND ELI TOGETHER.

238
00:10:22,664 --> 00:10:24,833
IT'S FINE.
I GET IT.

239

YOU DON'T WANT TO HANG OUT
WITH ME ANYMORE.

00:10:26,543 --> 00:10:29,004
WHAT? NO!
THAT'S NOT IT AT ALL!

241
00:10:29,087 --> 00:10:30,130
I'M NOT TRYING
TO GET RID OF YOU.

242
00:10:30,214 --> 00:10:31,673
IT'S JUST...

243
00:10:31,757 --> 00:10:33,008
WE HAVE SO MUCH
IN COMMON

244
00:10:33,091 --> 00:10:34,009
AND WE'VE BEEN THROUGH
SO MUCH

245
00:10:34,092 --> 00:10:35,511
IN SUCH A SHORT PERIOD
OF TIME,

246
00:10:35,594 --> 00:10:37,137
IT'S OVERWHELMING.

247
00:10:37,221 --> 00:10:38,263
AND WHATEVER HAPPENS
WITH ELI,

248
00:10:38,347 --> 00:10:40,933
IT'S NOT GONNA CHANGE US.

250
00:10:45,521 --> 00:10:47,981
OOOOOH,
I LOVE YOUR HUGS!

AND I LIKE INTENSE
FRIENDSHIPS.

252
00:10:51,026 --> 00:10:53,904
THAT'S WHY
WE GET A-PLUSES.

253
00:11:07,668 --> 00:11:09,336
I NEED TO GET IN THERE,
BRO.

254
00:11:09,419 --> 00:11:10,337
THIS SEEMS TO BE
THE ONLY WAY

255
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:11,547
TO GET YOUR ATTENTION.

256
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:12,548
I MEAN, YOU DON'T RESPOND
TO VOICEMAILS

257
00:11:12,631 --> 00:11:13,715
OR TEXTS ANYMORE?

258
00:11:13,799 --> 00:11:14,967
MY PHONE ISN'T WORKING.

259
00:11:15,050 --> 00:11:16,677
WHAT HAPPENED TO IT?

260
00:11:17,678 --> 00:11:19,847
I THREW IT IN
A FISH TANK.

261
00:11:20,973 --> 00:11:22,850
IT'S JUST PLASTIC AND WIRES,
JAKE.

262
00:11:22,933 --> 00:11:23,809
I DON'T WANT TO BE
TIED TO IT.

263
00:11:23,892 --> 00:11:24,852
AND BY THE WAY,

264
00:11:24,935 --> 00:11:27,229
YOUR NEGATIVITY
IS STRESSING ME OUT.

265
00:11:27,312 --> 00:11:29,898
WELL, YOUR DAD CALLED
THIS MORNING

266
00:11:29,982 --> 00:11:32,693
BECAUSE YOU WEREN'T ANSWERING
YOUR PLASTIC AND WIRES.

267
00:11:32,776 --> 00:11:33,735
HE ALSO SAID
HE HASN'T SPOKEN TO YOU

268
00:11:33,819 --> 00:11:34,736
SINCE YOUR DINNER
THE OTHER NIGHT.

269
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:37,990
WHICH IS ODD
SINCE YOU'RE LIVING WITH HIM.

270
00:11:39,324 --> 00:11:40,659
DON'T WORRY,
I DIDN'T BLOW IT FOR YOU.

271
00:11:40,742 --> 00:11:42,578
BUT IT'S A GOOD THING
I ANSWERED THE CALL

272
00:11:42,661 --> 00:11:43,745
AND NOT YOUR MOM.

273
00:11:43,829 --> 00:11:44,746
WHERE ARE YOU STAYING?

274
00:11:44,830 --> 00:11:46,331
WITH A FRIEND.

275
00:11:47,332 --> 00:11:48,417
YOU DON'T KNOW HER.

276
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:51,753
I MET HER DOWNTOWN
A FEW DAYS AGO.

277
00:11:53,130 --> 00:11:54,047
SHE AND HER BOYFRIEND

278
00:11:54,131 --> 00:11:55,799
HAVE BEEN INCREDIBLY
KIND TO ME.

279
00:11:55,883 --> 00:11:56,800
THEY'RE MY SAVIORS.

280
00:11:56,884 --> 00:11:58,594
NOW I'D APPRECIATE IT
IF YOU'D KEEP IT TO YOURSELF.

281
00:11:58,677 --> 00:12:00,304
UH, NO!

282
00:12:00,387 --> 00:12:01,930
CLARE, I'M NOT GONNA
KEEP THIS TO MYSELF.

283
00:12:02,014 --> 00:12:03,557
THIS IS SO DANGEROUS!

284
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:04,808
YOU BARELY KNOW
THESE PEOPLE.

285
00:12:04,892 --> 00:12:07,311
IT'S BETTER THIS WAY.
JUST LET IT GO.

286
00:12:07,394 --> 00:12:09,855
JAKE:
LOOK, I'LL STOP HANGING OUT
WITH JENNA.

287
00:12:09,938 --> 00:12:10,856
I'LL MOVE OUT.

288
00:12:10,939 --> 00:12:12,316

I'LL DO IT.

290
00:12:13,942 --> 00:12:15,485
I DON'T NEED YOU
TO DO ANYTHING.

291
00:12:15,569 --> 00:12:18,447
NOBODY HAS ANY IDEA
WHERE YOU ARE!

292
00:12:18,530 --> 00:12:19,531
FINE.

293
00:12:21,533 --> 00:12:23,076
THAT'S THE ADDRESS.
OKAY?

294
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:24,244
FOR EMERGENCIES ONLY.

295
00:12:24,328 --> 00:12:26,038
THEY DON'T LIKE VISITORS.

296
00:12:26,121 --> 00:12:28,874
I CAN'T KEEP THIS
A SECRET.

297
00:12:32,794 --> 00:12:35,881
IF YOU EVER LOVED ME,
YOU WILL.

00:12:53,815 --> 00:12:54,900
YOU UNDERSTAND ME?!

305
00:12:59,988 --> 00:13:02,616
AND WHAT'S SO IMPORTANT
THAT YOU'RE BAILING ON US, MO?

306
00:13:02,699 --> 00:13:03,909
IT'S THIS THING.

OH, AND THIS "THING" IS
MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE GAME,

FOR THE ENTIRE SEASON?!

309
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:09,831

MORE IMPORTANT

00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:03,886
WELL, ME AND ELI

00:14:03,969 --> 00:14:04,887
THE TALK -

334
00:14:04,970 --> 00:14:06,555
AND IT TURNS OUT

335
00:14:06,638 --> 00:14:07,973
WE REALLY NEEDED THAT
KICK IN THE PANTS

336
00:14:08,056 --> 00:14:09,057

SUMMER:
HOME IS WHEREVER THE PEOPLE
THAT CARE ABOUT YOU ARE.

349
00:14:48,013 --> 00:14:50,599
SO THAT NO CELL PHONE POLICY
