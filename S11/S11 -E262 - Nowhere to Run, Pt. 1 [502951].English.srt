17
00:00:39,414 --> 00:00:42,125
I STILL HAVE FEELINGS
FOR HIM,

18
00:00:42,209 --> 00:00:43,293
BUT HE'S MOVED ON.

19
00:00:43,377 --> 00:00:45,546

00:03:19,658 --> 00:03:21,285
BEFORE SCHOOL STARTS.

76
00:03:21,368 --> 00:03:22,828
I JUST GOT BACK
FROM A SOCCER TOURNAMENT.

77
00:03:22,911 --> 00:03:24,288
I'VE HAD NO TIME
TO PREPARE

78
00:03:24,371 --> 00:03:25,831
FOR BACK-TO-SCHOOL.

79
00:03:25,914 --> 00:03:28,166

00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:36,675
EVERYTHING NEEDS
TO BE PERFECT.

84
00:03:36,758 --> 00:03:38,260

00:03:49,104 --> 00:03:50,647
NOTE, DREW:

90
00:03:50,731 --> 00:03:52,316
MY LIFE ISN'T MAGICALLY
PERFECT.

91
00:03:52,399 --> 00:03:53,901
IT TAKES HARD WORK.

92
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:54,902

00:04:21,762 --> 00:04:24,014
WE'VE BEEN WATCHING
A LOT OF HORROR MOVIES.

107
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:25,891
YEAH, WHEN YOU'RE NOT HIDING
UNDER A BLANKET.

109
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:33,607
YOU KNOW WHAT?

110
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:34,691
UM, YOU'RE RIGHT,

111
00:04:34,775 --> 00:04:37,069
I DID PROMISE
THAT WE'D HAVE FUN.

112
00:04:37,152 --> 00:04:41,031
SO WHY DON'T WE GO
TO LUNCH - ON ME.

113
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:42,491

STAY THOUGH!

118

BUT MY MOM SAID
ONLY BLOOD RELATIVES

119
00:04:55,838 --> 00:04:58,298
BECAUSE OF THE LIVING ROOM
SPACE RESTRICTIONS.

120
00:04:58,382 --> 00:04:59,883

124
00:05:08,809 --> 00:05:10,060
YOU KNOW,
THIS IS WEIRD.

125
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:12,437
WHEN I WAS AT SCIENCE CAMP,
WE TEXTED LIKE 24/7,

126
00:05:12,521 --> 00:05:15,399
