00:00:01,877 --> 00:00:03,253
YUP. I UNDERSTAND.

2
00:00:03,337 --> 00:00:05,589
I'LL LET THEM KNOW.
BYE.

00:00:05,672 --> 00:00:06,590
(PHONE BEEPS OFF)

4
00:00:06,673 --> 00:00:07,758
WHAT'S WRONG?

5
00:00:07,841 --> 00:00:10,552
UH... YOUR FATHER
HAS AN OPPORTUNITY

6
00:00:10,636 --> 00:00:12,429
TO TRANSFER
TO THE BOSTON OFFICE,

7
00:00:12,513 --> 00:00:13,805
IF YOU'RE STILL SERIOUS
ABOUT MOVING.

8
00:00:13,889 --> 00:00:14,806
YEAH!

9
00:00:14,890 --> 00:00:15,807
MOVING?!

10
00:00:15,891 --> 00:00:17,267
SOMEONE TELL ME
THIS IS A PRACTICAL JOKE.

IT'S JUST SOMETHING
WE'VE BEEN DISCUSSING, ADAM.

12

ADAM:
WHO'S "WE"?

13
00:00:20,687 --> 00:00:22,272
YOUR BROTHER'S HAD
TROUBLE COPING

14
00:00:22,356 --> 00:00:23,690
SINCE THE INCIDENT
WITH THE GANG.

15
00:00:23,774 --> 00:00:24,733
AND YOUR FATHER
AND I THINK

16
00:00:24,816 --> 00:00:26,652
THAT A CHANGE OF SCENERY
MIGHT HELP.

17
00:00:26,735 --> 00:00:28,695
SO WHAT?
MY VOTE DOESN'T COUNT?

18
00:00:28,779 --> 00:00:30,364
I LIKE IT HERE.
I HAVE FRIENDS.

19
00:00:30,447 --> 00:00:31,365

YEAH, 'CAUSE THAT'S EASY
FOR THE TRANSGENDER KID.

00:00:34,493 --> 00:00:36,870
OKAY, I LIKED OUR OLD SCHOOL,
BUT I GAVE IT UP FOR YOU.

23
00:00:36,954 --> 00:00:38,664
YEAH, PEOPLE THOUGHT
I WAS A FREAK THERE.

24
00:00:38,747 --> 00:00:41,083
I CAME TO DEGRASSI
FOR A FRESH START.

25
00:00:41,166 --> 00:00:41,959
YOUR PROBLEM'S
IN YOUR HEAD.

26
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:43,669
WHEREVER WE GO,
IT'S COMING WITH US.

27
00:00:43,752 --> 00:00:45,003
OKAY, WHAT'S YOUR POINT?

28
00:00:45,087 --> 00:00:46,338
YOU HAVEN'T TRIED
TO GET BETTER.

29
00:00:46,421 --> 00:00:47,881
YOU'RE RUNNING AWAY.

30
00:00:48,882 --> 00:00:51,969
OKAY, STOP.
APOLOGIZE TO YOUR BROTHER.

31
00:00:53,345 --> 00:00:55,430
DREW, I'M SORRY
YOU'RE SUCH A WIMP.

32
00:00:55,514 --> 00:00:56,515
OH, ADAM!

33
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:59,935
YOU KNOW WHAT?
THIS IS TOTALLY UNFAIR!

34
00:01:00,018 --> 00:01:02,354
IT'S TOTALLY SOMETHING.

35
00:01:05,983 --> 00:01:07,734

36
00:01:07,818 --> 00:01:11,029

ARE IN DENIAL

NO GUARANTEE

00:16:14,683 --> 00:16:15,601
I'M FREE TOMORROW

352
00:16:15,684 --> 00:16:18,187
IF OWEN HERE
ISN'T TOO SCARED.

353
00:16:18,270 --> 00:16:20,272
OWEN:
HOO-HOO-HOO! OKAY.

354
00:16:20,355 --> 00:16:21,940
I'LL BRING MY 'A' GAME,
BUDDY.

355
00:16:22,024 --> 00:16:23,859
THEM'S FIGHTING WORDS.

356
00:16:31,116 --> 00:16:33,827
DAVE:
HEY... DAVE TURNER,
REPORTING FOR CLEAN UP DUTY.

357
00:16:33,911 --> 00:16:36,163
LOOKS LIKE YOU MISSED
YOUR MOUTH.

358
00:16:36,246 --> 00:16:39,249
HEH... APPARENTLY HONESTY
IS NOT THE BEST POLICY.

359
00:16:39,333 --> 00:16:41,752
ALLI:
WHAT DID YOU DO?
INSULT JUSTIN BIEBER?

360
00:16:41,835 --> 00:16:45,923
(LAUGHS) NO, I TOLD HER
I DUG ANOTHER GIRL.

361
00:16:46,006 --> 00:16:48,884
SO... THIS OTHER GIRL,
DO I KNOW HER?

362
00:16:49,885 --> 00:16:51,762
UH, I BELIEVE SO.

363
00:16:51,845 --> 00:16:52,638
YOU SEE THERE'S
THIS PROBLEM,

364
00:16:52,721 --> 00:16:55,140
I WENT AFTER THIS GIRL
ONCE ALREADY AND...

365
00:16:55,224 --> 00:16:57,142
GOT BRUTALLY REJECTED.

366
00:16:57,226 --> 00:16:58,602
WHAT A BITCH.

367
00:16:58,685 --> 00:17:00,687
NAH,
SHE'S NOT ALL THAT BAD.

368
00:17:00,771 --> 00:17:02,940
SHE MAKES ME LAUGH...
A LOT,

369
00:17:03,023 --> 00:17:04,566
SHE CAN EAT MORE
THAN I CAN,

370
00:17:04,650 --> 00:17:07,486
AND UH...
OOH! SHE'S KINDA HOT.

371
00:17:09,196 --> 00:17:10,489
HOW HOT?

372
00:17:10,572 --> 00:17:12,574
AT LEAST A SEVEN.

373
00:17:12,658 --> 00:17:14,993
WELL, MAYBE THIS TIME
THINGS WILL BE DIFFERENT.

374
00:17:15,077 --> 00:17:16,161
YEAH?

375
00:17:16,245 --> 00:17:18,205
SOUNDS LIKE THIS GIRL
HAD TO DATE A FEW DUDS

376
00:17:18,288 --> 00:17:22,668
TO APPRECIATE DAVE TURNER'S
UNIQUE JE NE SAIS QUOI.

377
00:17:22,751 --> 00:17:25,212
YEAH, WELL YOU THINK THIS
GIRL IS FREE NEXT TUESDAY?

378
00:17:25,295 --> 00:17:27,756
I HAVE A FEELING SHE IS.

379
00:17:28,757 --> 00:17:30,342
ALL RIGHT,
THEN IT'S A DATE.

380
00:17:30,425 --> 00:17:32,052
OH, AND DAVE...

381
00:17:33,428 --> 00:17:34,471
I'M A TWELVE.

382
00:17:34,555 --> 00:17:37,599
(LAUGHS) AT LEAST.

383
00:17:38,976 --> 00:17:40,269
AT LEAST.

384
00:17:42,604 --> 00:17:43,730
HEY! HOW WAS MOVIE NIGHT?

385
00:17:43,814 --> 00:17:44,898
YEAH, IT WAS GREAT.

386
00:17:44,982 --> 00:17:46,859
GOOD. THIS COULD BE
ONE OF YOUR VERY LAST

387
00:17:46,942 --> 00:17:48,944
DEGRASSI EVENTS EVER.

388
00:17:49,027 --> 00:17:51,905
HEY MOM, IS DAD GONNA
TAKE THAT BOSTON THING?

389
00:17:51,989 --> 00:17:53,198
IS THIS ABOUT
YOUR BROTHER?

390
00:17:53,282 --> 00:17:55,117
NO, MOM, IT'S...

391
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,536
I JUST...
I DON'T WANT TO RUN AWAY.

392
00:17:57,619 --> 00:18:02,457
I THINK THAT IF I STAY HERE,
I CAN FIND A WAY TO MOVE ON.

393
00:18:03,458 --> 00:18:06,545
AND WHAT PROMPTED
THIS SUDDEN CHANGE OF HEART?

394
00:18:06,628 --> 00:18:08,255
I MADE SOME NEW FRIENDS.

395
00:18:08,338 --> 00:18:09,798
THEY SHOWED ME
THERE WAS ANOTHER WAY.

396
00:18:09,882 --> 00:18:11,717
MM-HM...

397
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,719
THIS ISN'T DRUGS AGAIN,
IS IT?

398
00:18:13,802 --> 00:18:15,179
(LAUGHS) NO, MOM.
RELAX.

399
00:18:15,262 --> 00:18:18,640
IT'S UH...
LIKE A SPORTS THING.

400
00:18:19,892 --> 00:18:21,351
OKAY.

401
00:18:21,435 --> 00:18:26,064
WELL, I SUPPOSE I CAN SUPPORT
"LIKE A SPORTS THING".

402
00:18:26,148 --> 00:18:28,317
I'LL HAVE TO TALK
TO YOUR FATHER, THOUGH.

403
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,110
HE'S GONNA FLIP.

404
00:18:30,194 --> 00:18:31,195
THANKS.

405
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:35,157
LISTEN, IF YOU'RE STILL
HAVING TROUBLE,

406
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:37,659
WE CAN FIND YOU
SOME HELP.

407
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:40,996
IT'S OKAY,
I'LL BE FINE.

410
00:18:46,627 --> 00:18:48,587
CLARE:
I FOUND MY PARENTS'
DIVORCE PAPERS

411
00:18:48,670 --> 00:18:50,797
BEFORE YOU CAME OVER.

412
00:18:51,798 --> 00:18:55,719
MY DAD CHEATED ON MY MOM,
MORE THAN ONCE.

413
00:18:57,513 --> 00:18:59,598
WE BOTH KNOW
WHERE THIS IS HEADED.

414
00:18:59,681 --> 00:19:01,266
WE GO OUT FOR A COUPLE WEEKS,
MAYBE A MONTH-

415
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:02,768
WE HAVE FUN.

416
00:19:02,851 --> 00:19:05,312
AND THEN ONE OF US
CHANGES OUR MINDS -

417
00:19:05,395 --> 00:19:07,898
DECIDES WE'RE NOT
INTO IT ANYMORE -

418
00:19:07,981 --> 00:19:09,525
AND WE BREAK UP,

419
00:19:10,526 --> 00:19:12,027
AND EVERY TIME
WE SEE EACH OTHER

420
00:19:12,110 --> 00:19:15,197
IT'S UNCOMFORTABLE.

421
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:18,575
MAYBE WE SHOULD
JUST STAY FRIENDS.

422
00:19:18,659 --> 00:19:21,828
I DON'T THINK
THAT'S GONNA WORK.

423
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:26,458
THEN WHAT DO WE DO?

424
00:19:26,542 --> 00:19:30,128
WELL, WE CAN ALWAYS TRY
AVOIDING EACH OTHER.

425
00:19:32,047 --> 00:19:34,550
OR WE COULD TAKE A RISK.

426
00:19:53,235 --> 00:19:54,653
