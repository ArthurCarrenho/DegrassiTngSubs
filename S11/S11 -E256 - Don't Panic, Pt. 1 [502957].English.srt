1
00:00:05,297 --> 00:00:06,757
HEALTH INITIATIVE,
PRO OR CON?

2
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:10,385
KATIE-KINS, IT'S
A HIGH SCHOOL ELECTION.

3
00:00:10,469 --> 00:00:11,929
NOBODY CARES
ABOUT THE ISSUES.

4
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:14,515
THEN HOW WILL I GET
PEOPLE TO VOTE FOR ME?

5
00:00:14,598 --> 00:00:16,517
BY WEARING
TIGHTER SHIRTS.

6
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:19,603
I DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHY YOU'RE SO NERVOUS.

7
00:00:19,686 --> 00:00:22,439
THE ONLY PERSON RUNNING
AGAINST YOU IS MO.

8
00:00:22,523 --> 00:00:24,608
HE'S FUNNY.
HE'S FRIENDLY.

9
00:00:24,691 --> 00:00:26,026
HE'S TRIPLE XL.

10
00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:30,781
PEOPLE WANT THEIR PRESIDENT
TO BE ASPIRATIONAL.

11
00:00:30,864 --> 00:00:33,450
LIKE THE GIRL
IN THIS POSTER.

12
00:00:33,534 --> 00:00:36,537
BUT WEARING A TIGHTER
SHIRT WOULDN'T HURT.

13
00:00:39,665 --> 00:00:40,582
HEY.

14
00:00:40,666 --> 00:00:41,667
BOTH:
HI.

15
00:00:43,877 --> 00:00:44,962
CAN YOU BELIEVE IT?!

16
00:00:45,045 --> 00:00:47,589
DREW TORRES JUST
FLIRTED WITH ME!

17
00:00:47,673 --> 00:00:49,633
I THOUGHT YOU
WERE OVER DREW.

18
00:00:49,716 --> 00:00:52,219
YOU NEVER GET OVER
AN EPIC CRUSH.

19
00:00:52,302 --> 00:00:55,722
CAN'T YOU IMAGINE THOSE
ARMS WRAPPED AROUND YOU?

20
00:00:55,806 --> 00:00:57,975
THOSE LIPS KISSING YOURS?

21
00:00:58,058 --> 00:00:59,184
(BELL RINGS)

22
00:01:00,185 --> 00:01:01,895
MARE, DREW AND I-

23
00:01:02,938 --> 00:01:04,731
ARE IN THE SAME
TAE KWAN DO CLASS.

24
00:01:04,815 --> 00:01:08,151
I KNOW. COULD YOU
PUT OUT SOME FEELERS?

25
00:01:08,235 --> 00:01:10,070
SEE IF HE'S
INTERESTED?

26
00:01:10,153 --> 00:01:11,905
PLEASE, PLEASE!

27
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:14,241
SURE.

28
00:01:14,324 --> 00:01:15,409
I KNEW THERE
WAS A REASON

29
00:01:15,492 --> 00:01:17,661
YOU WERE MY
BEST FRIEND.

30
00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:19,663
WE BETTER GET THESE
POSTERS UP BEFORE CLASS.

BUT I DIDN'T STOP

47
00:02:13,425 --> 00:02:16,094
BECAUSE YOUR MIND TRICKS YOU.

48
00:02:17,095 --> 00:02:19,598
IT TRICKS YOU INTO THINKING
THAT THINGS ARE FINE,

49
00:02:19,681 --> 00:02:21,058
(AGITATED)
THEY'RE NOT FINE.
NOTHING IS FINE.

50
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:22,559
(YELLS) IT'S ALL WRONG!

51
00:02:22,643 --> 00:02:24,061
LOOK AT THOSE EYES.

52
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:25,395
THOSE ARE CRAZY
PERSON EYES.

53
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:26,772
YOU WERE HAVING
A MANIC EPISODE.

54
00:02:26,855 --> 00:02:28,899
AND HURT A LOT
OF PEOPLE.

55
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:30,984
HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO FACE
THEM BACK AT SCHOOL?

56
00:02:31,068 --> 00:02:33,612
YOU'LL KEEP TAKING YOUR
MEDS AND TALKING TO ME.

57
00:02:33,695 --> 00:02:35,864
AND WHEN YOU'RE READY,
YOU'LL APOLOGIZE.

58
00:02:35,948 --> 00:02:37,783
THAT'S AN IMPORTANT
STEP TO RECOVERY.

59
00:02:37,866 --> 00:02:39,910
YOU MAKE IT
SOUND SO EASY.

60
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:41,411
IT'S NOT.

61
00:02:41,495 --> 00:02:43,664
EVERY DAY IS GOING
TO BE A STRUGGLE.

62
00:02:43,747 --> 00:02:45,082
BUT A BIPOLAR DIAGNOSIS
DOESN'T HAVE TO BE

63
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:46,416
THE END OF THE WORLD.

64
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:49,211
LOTS OF GREAT PEOPLE
SUFFER FROM IT.

65
00:02:49,294 --> 00:02:50,379
ERNEST HEMINGWAY.

66
00:02:50,462 --> 00:02:51,839
EDGAR ALLEN PO.

67
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:54,424
JACKSON POLLOCK.

68
00:02:54,508 --> 00:02:56,552
VINCENT VAN GOGH.

69
00:02:56,635 --> 00:02:58,971
MAYBE I SHOULD STAY HOME
FOR A FEW MORE DAYS.

70
00:02:59,054 --> 00:03:01,390
DON'T WANT TO
CUT OFF AN EAR.

71
00:03:01,473 --> 00:03:03,183
HEY LOOK, IF YOU
FIND YOURSELF STRUGGLING,

72
00:03:03,267 --> 00:03:05,435
JUST GIVE ME A CALL.

73
00:03:07,354 --> 00:03:08,605
I KNOW
YOU CAN DO THIS.

74
00:03:08,689 --> 00:03:09,606
I'LL TRY.

75
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:11,400
NAH, YOU'LL DO
MORE THAN THAT.

76
00:03:11,483 --> 00:03:14,528
YOU'RE COMMITTED
TO GETTING BETTER.

77
00:03:14,611 --> 00:03:16,154
THERE'S NOTHING
I WANT MORE.

78
00:03:16,238 --> 00:03:17,364
THEN YOU BETTER GO.

79
00:03:17,447 --> 00:03:19,700
DON'T WANT TO BE LATE
FOR YOUR FIRST CLASS.

80
00:03:19,783 --> 00:03:21,368
(BREATHES DEEPLY)
THANKS.

81
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:25,497
KATIE:
HEY, HOW ARE YOU?

82
00:03:25,581 --> 00:03:27,207
I'M BETTER SINCE, YOU
KNOW, SOME GIRL TOLD ME

83
00:03:27,291 --> 00:03:29,293
THAT FIGHTING WON'T
SOLVE ALL MY PROBLEMS.

84
00:03:29,376 --> 00:03:30,586
SHE SOUNDS
PRETTY SMART.

85
00:03:30,669 --> 00:03:32,421
OH, SHE IS. THAT'S WHY
I WOULD LIKE TO THANK HER

86
00:03:32,504 --> 00:03:36,133
WITH TICKETS TO THE
CANADA/US SOCCER GAME.

87
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:38,844
I WOULD DIE
TO SEE THAT!

88
00:03:38,927 --> 00:03:42,472
THAT IS WHY I THOUGHT IT'D
BE THE PERFECT FIRST DATE.

89
00:03:42,556 --> 00:03:44,308
C'MON. DON'T MAKE ME
GET ON MY KNEES.

90
00:03:44,391 --> 00:03:45,309
I'D LOVE TO-

91
00:03:45,392 --> 00:03:46,393
BUT?

92
00:03:48,395 --> 00:03:50,480
KATIE:
MY BEST FRIEND
STILL LIKES YOU.

93
00:03:50,564 --> 00:03:52,065
KATIE, IT'S BEEN
MONTHS SINCE MARISOL

94
00:03:52,149 --> 00:03:54,109
BORED ME TO DEATH
ON THAT DATE.

95
00:03:54,193 --> 00:03:57,487
I KNOW, BUT GOING AFTER
YOUR BEST FRIEND'S CRUSH

96
00:03:57,571 --> 00:03:59,239
IS VERBOTEN.

97
00:03:59,323 --> 00:04:02,034
OKAY, SO THEN I GUESS
I'LL JUST HAVE TO TELL HER

98
00:04:02,117 --> 00:04:04,536
THAT I WENT AFTER YOU.

99
00:04:05,204 --> 00:04:07,956
HEY. I FOUND
MORE STICKY TACK.

100
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:11,960
SO, WHAT WERE YOU GUYS
CHATTING ABOUT ABOUT?

101
00:04:12,044 --> 00:04:14,671
OH, WE WERE
JUST VERBALIZING...

102
00:04:14,755 --> 00:04:16,298
YEAH, ABOUT HOW
KATIE'S GOING TO BE

103
00:04:16,381 --> 00:04:19,676
THE BEST PRESIDENT
DEGRASSI HAS EVER SEEN.

104
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:20,677
(BELL RINGS)

105
00:04:20,761 --> 00:04:22,262
UGH, MATH.

106
00:04:22,346 --> 00:04:25,974
IF I'M LATE AGAIN,
ARMSTRONG IS GOING TO FLIP.

107
00:04:29,353 --> 00:04:32,481
I KNOW WHAT YOU AND DREW
WERE REALLY TALKING ABOUT.

108
00:04:32,564 --> 00:04:34,316
YOU DO?!

109
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:37,194
SO, IS HE INTERESTED
IN ME OR WHAT?

110
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:38,737
RIGHT. UM...

111
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:40,197
THE THING IS, HE GAVE
ME THE IMPRESSION

112
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,950
HE WAS INTERESTED
IN SOMEONE ELSE.

113
00:04:43,033 --> 00:04:44,618
GOOD TO KNOW.

114
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,336
VOTE MO FOR PREZ.

115
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:57,798
HE'S NOT POPULAR,
SO HE'S GOT TIME FOR YOU.

116
00:04:57,881 --> 00:04:59,216
THINK YOU MIGHT BE
OVERSELLING YOURSELF.

117
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:00,300
OUCH!

118
00:05:01,552 --> 00:05:02,553
SAV.

119
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:06,306
(QUIETLY)
BAM-CHICKA-WHA-WHA.

120
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:09,017
WHAT'S UP MS. OH?

121
00:05:09,101 --> 00:05:10,561
SAV, I'M CONCERNED.

122
00:05:10,644 --> 00:05:11,562
ABOUT MY LAST
ASSIGNMENT?

123
00:05:11,645 --> 00:05:12,729
YOUR MUSICAL ACUMEN.

124
00:05:12,813 --> 00:05:14,690
LAST TIME WE SPOKE,
YOU MENTIONED A BAND.

125
00:05:14,773 --> 00:05:15,941
DEADHAND, YEAH.

126
00:05:16,024 --> 00:05:17,359
THEIR DRUMMER'S OUT
OF THIS WORLD.

127
00:05:17,442 --> 00:05:19,486
MEDIOCRE AT BEST.

128
00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:22,948
IF YOU WANNA HEAR
GREAT DRUMMING...

129
00:05:23,031 --> 00:05:24,700
YOU MADE ME A CD?

130
00:05:24,783 --> 00:05:27,494
FOR YOUR MUSICAL
DEVELOPMENT.

131
00:05:27,578 --> 00:05:29,162
OF COURSE.

132
00:05:29,246 --> 00:05:31,832
MY MUSICAL DEVELOPMENT.

133
00:05:31,915 --> 00:05:34,918
I GOT TO GET TO
MY NEXT CLASS.

134
00:05:37,212 --> 00:05:39,006
YOU LIAR. I THOUGHT
YOU SAID NOTHING HAPPENED

135
00:05:39,089 --> 00:05:40,674
AFTER YOU RAN INTO
HER AT THE CONCERT.

136
00:05:40,757 --> 00:05:41,758
NOTHING DID.

137
00:05:41,842 --> 00:05:43,385
WE'VE JUST BEEN
TALKING MUSIC.

138
00:05:43,468 --> 00:05:45,554
THERE'S NO PROOF
SHE'S ACTUALLY INTO ME.

139
00:05:45,637 --> 00:05:47,181
MAN, SHE GAVE YOU
A MIX CD.

140
00:05:47,264 --> 00:05:49,641
THAT'S HER GENERATION'S
CODE FOR LET'S GET IT ON!

141
00:05:49,725 --> 00:05:52,060
CARPE DIEM, MY FRIEND.

142
00:05:53,103 --> 00:05:55,439
(WHISPERS)
CARPE DIEM.

143
00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:02,446
JUST UPDATED SIMPSON
ON YOUR CONDITION.

144
00:06:02,529 --> 00:06:03,447
YOU'LL VISIT
THE SCHOOL NURSE

145
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:06,450
TWICE A DAY
TO GET YOUR MEDS.

146
00:06:09,995 --> 00:06:11,038
WHATCHA DOING?

147
00:06:11,121 --> 00:06:15,459
MAKING A REVENGE LIST.
ANYBODY I SHOULD ADD?

148
00:06:15,542 --> 00:06:17,461
I'M JUST KIDDING,
BULLFROG.

149
00:06:17,544 --> 00:06:19,463
I KNEW THAT.

150
00:06:19,546 --> 00:06:21,632
WOW. YOU MUST REALLY
THINK I'M CRAZY.

151
00:06:21,715 --> 00:06:23,300
NOT THAT I BLAME YOU.
MY ACTIONS OVER THE PAST

152
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:25,511
FEW WEEKS HAVE
CROSSED THE LINE.

153
00:06:25,594 --> 00:06:27,471
WHICH IS WHY I OWE
TONS OF APOLOGIES.

154
00:06:27,554 --> 00:06:28,472
THAT'S WHAT
THE LIST IS FOR?

155
00:06:28,555 --> 00:06:29,765
ONCE I GET THESE GUYS
TO FORGIVE ME,

156
00:06:29,848 --> 00:06:31,642
I HOPE THAT MY LIFE
GO BACK TO NORMAL.

157
00:06:31,725 --> 00:06:33,143
WHO'S FIRST?

158
00:06:33,227 --> 00:06:34,853
(SIGHS) THE ONE GIRL
I NEED ON MY SIDE

159
00:06:34,937 --> 00:06:36,230
MOST RIGHT NOW.

160
00:06:37,231 --> 00:06:38,524
BETTER GET STARTED.

161
00:06:38,607 --> 00:06:41,318
NOT BEFORE YOU
TAKE YOUR PILL.

162
00:06:42,528 --> 00:06:43,570
(SIGHS)

163
00:06:49,785 --> 00:06:50,702
UGH.

164
00:06:50,786 --> 00:06:52,621
(LAUGHS)

165
00:06:52,704 --> 00:06:54,706
I'LL LEAVE THE REST OF THESE
WITH THE SCHOOL NURSE.

166
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:56,875
GOOD LUCK, BIG GUY.

167
00:07:00,712 --> 00:07:02,339
SIMPSON:
OKAY, LET'S GET STARTED.

168
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:03,966
NOW, TOMORROW WE'LL
KICK-OFF CAMPAIGNING

169
00:07:04,049 --> 00:07:06,093
BY HAVING THE CANDIDATES
INTRODUCE THEMSELVES,

170
00:07:06,176 --> 00:07:07,344
THE NEXT DAY WE'LL
HAVE A Q & A,

171
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:08,762
AND THEN WE'LL SEND
EVERYONE OFF TO THE POLLS.

172
00:07:08,846 --> 00:07:09,763
ANY QUESTIONS?

173
00:07:09,847 --> 00:07:11,139
NO? OKAY.

174
00:07:11,223 --> 00:07:14,226
WELL, FOR CLASS PRESIDENT
WE HAVE MO MASHKOUR...

175
00:07:14,309 --> 00:07:15,227
MALE STUDENT:
GO MO!

176
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:16,812
AND KATIE MATLIN.

177
00:07:16,895 --> 00:07:19,106
OH, IS IT TOO LATE TO
ADD ONE MORE TO THE LIST?

178
00:07:19,189 --> 00:07:21,275
SHE'S JOKING, SIR.

179
00:07:21,358 --> 00:07:23,110
NO, I'M NOT.

180
00:07:23,193 --> 00:07:25,279
MAY THE BEST
GIRL WIN.

181
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:27,447
OKAY, ANYONE ELSE?

182
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:29,783
ALL RIGHT.

183
00:07:30,868 --> 00:07:32,452
(WHISPERS) YOU KNOW
HOW MUCH I WANT THIS.

184
00:07:32,536 --> 00:07:34,788
AS MUCH AS
I WANTED DREW?

185
00:07:34,872 --> 00:07:36,915
I OVERHEARD YOUR
LITTLE CONVERSATION.

186
00:07:36,999 --> 00:07:38,458

SOCCER DATE.

187
00:07:38,542 --> 00:07:39,459

GONNA TELL YOU-

188
00:07:39,543 --> 00:07:42,045

YOUR ENGAGEMENT?

MAKE IT THROUGH

192
00:07:52,973 --> 00:07:55,976

WITHOUT YOU.

193
00:07:57,102 --> 00:07:58,770

THE DIRECTOR, RIGHT?

196
00:08:07,571 --> 00:08:09,072
WELL, IF YOU DIDN'T
BAIL ME OUT ON STAGE,

197
00:08:09,156 --> 00:08:10,574

BOMBED.

198
00:08:10,657 --> 00:08:11,783
WELL, THAT'S
PRETTY TERRIFIC

199
00:08:11,867 --> 00:08:14,077
CONSIDERING YOU TRIED
TO GET ME FIRED.

200
00:08:14,161 --> 00:08:15,662
HA! I PLEAD INSANITY.

201
00:08:15,746 --> 00:08:17,039

BACK ME UP.

ANSWER MY TEXTS.

214
00:08:42,272 --> 00:08:44,566
I'M GONNA LOSE MY BEST
FRIEND AND THE ELECTION.

215
00:08:44,650 --> 00:08:46,443
RUNNING AGAINST MO
WAS ONE THING.

216
00:08:46,527 --> 00:08:47,694
PEOPLE BARELY
KNOW HIM.

217
00:08:47,778 --> 00:08:49,780
BUT MARE'S
MISS POPULARITY.

218
00:08:49,863 --> 00:08:51,865

WAY MORE THAN ME.

219
00:08:51,949 --> 00:08:52,866
I DON'T.

220
00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:54,368
THAT'S WHAT GOT ME
INTO THIS SITUATION

221
00:08:54,451 --> 00:08:56,537
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

222
00:08:57,746 --> 00:08:59,289
WHAT IF SHE NEVER
FORGIVES ME?

223
00:08:59,373 --> 00:09:01,792
ISN'T SHE THE ONE RUNNING
AGAINST YOU FOR PRESIDENT?

224
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:03,794
ONLY BECAUSE SHE FEELS
LIKE I BETRAYED HER.

225
00:09:03,877 --> 00:09:05,796
MARE AND I HAVE BEEN BEST
FRIENDS SINCE KINDERGARTEN.

226
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:07,631
WE'VE BEEN THROUGH
EVERYTHING TOGETHER.

227
00:09:07,714 --> 00:09:09,967
WE'RE LIKE SISTERS.

228
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:13,804
SO? SHOULDN'T SISTERS
BE ABLE TO TALK THIS OUT?

229
00:09:13,887 --> 00:09:14,805
I SHOULD FIND HER.

230
00:09:14,888 --> 00:09:16,473
BEFORE THINGS GET
OUT OF CONTROL.

231

NOT ON AN EMPTY STOMACH.

232
00:09:18,225 --> 00:09:19,309
YOU MISSED LUNCH
'CUZ OF THAT MEETING,

233
00:09:19,393 --> 00:09:21,937
SO I SNAGGED YOU
A BURGER.

234
00:09:23,438 --> 00:09:25,691
THERE ARE LIKE A MILLION
CALORIES IN THAT.

235
00:09:25,774 --> 00:09:28,569
(HAMBURGER VOICE)
A MILLION DELICIOUS
CALORIES.

236
00:09:28,652 --> 00:09:31,488
IT'LL MAKE YOU
FEEL BETTER.

237
00:09:31,572 --> 00:09:32,739
NOT NOW.

238
00:09:35,325 --> 00:09:36,869
HEY.

239
00:09:36,952 --> 00:09:38,328
SO, THAT DISK
YOU GAVE ME,

240
00:09:38,412 --> 00:09:40,163
IT INSPIRED ME TO MAKE
SOME CHANGES TO A SONG.

241
00:09:40,247 --> 00:09:41,164
THAT'S GOOD,
ISN'T IT?

242
00:09:41,248 --> 00:09:42,833
YEAH, EXCEPT THAT
I'M HAVING TROUBLE

243
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:44,334

AH, THE TRICKIEST PART.

245
00:09:45,961 --> 00:09:46,962
RIGHT,
SO I WAS WONDERING

246
00:09:47,045 --> 00:09:49,089
IF I COULD
GET SOME HELP.

247
00:09:49,173 --> 00:09:50,424
FROM YOU.

248
00:09:51,592 --> 00:09:53,886
IF THAT WASN'T OBVIOUS,
WHICH IT PROBABLY WAS.

249
00:09:53,969 --> 00:09:55,721
I HAVE A LOT OF
MARKING TO DO TODAY.

250
00:09:55,804 --> 00:09:57,222
YEAH, SURE. YEAH...

251
00:09:57,306 --> 00:09:59,600

I UNDERSTAND.

252
00:10:01,268 --> 00:10:04,229
WHAT ABOUT TOMORROW
AT LUNCH?

253
00:10:05,564 --> 00:10:06,481
ARE YOU SURE?

254
00:10:06,565 --> 00:10:07,941
THAT I'D RATHER
SPEND AN HOUR

255
00:10:08,025 --> 00:10:09,359
WORKING ON MUSIC,
THAN LISTENING

256
00:10:09,443 --> 00:10:10,819

NEVER STAB

WHY, OUT OF ALL
THE GUYS AT DEGRASSI,

266
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:36,220
YOU GO AFTER
THE ONE I WANTED!?

267
00:10:36,303 --> 00:10:38,180
I DIDN'T GO AFTER HIM.
IT JUST HAPPENED.

268
00:10:38,263 --> 00:10:40,015
BUT YOU KNEW HOW
MUCH I LIKED HIM!

269
00:10:40,098 --> 00:10:41,475
MARE, YOU HAVE
TO FORGIVE ME.

270
00:10:41,558 --> 00:10:43,352
I'LL DO ANYTHING.

271
00:10:43,435 --> 00:10:44,686
ANYTHING?

272
00:10:45,812 --> 00:10:46,813
YOU NAME IT.

273
00:10:47,814 --> 00:10:50,067
END THINGS WITH DREW.

274
00:10:57,616 --> 00:10:58,700

CALLED YOU LAST NIGHT,

275
00:10:58,784 --> 00:11:01,203

SHOULD GO OUT.

WAY TO START.

CIRCUMSTANCES.

00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:22,724
SO, I TAKE IT YOUR
TALK WITH MARISOL

287
00:11:22,808 --> 00:11:24,560
DIDN'T GO WELL.

288
00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:27,229
DO YOU WANT ME
TO TALK TO HER?

289
00:11:27,312 --> 00:11:28,939
NO. I'M SORRY.

290
00:11:30,941 --> 00:11:33,402

A GUY COME BETWEEN US.

MUST HAVE BEEN A REASON.

294
00:11:40,325 --> 00:11:42,244
AM I JUST SUPPOSED
TO FORGET ALL THAT?

295
00:11:42,327 --> 00:11:43,245
NO.

296
00:11:43,328 --> 00:11:44,329

(SIGHS) HOW DID DREW
TAKE THE REJECTION?

354
00:14:38,629 --> 00:14:40,923
SURPRISINGLY WELL.

355
00:14:41,006 --> 00:14:42,883
YOU DIDN'T DO IT.

356
00:14:42,966 --> 00:14:44,218
SIMPSON:
ALL RIGHT EVERYONE,

357
00:14:44,301 --> 00:14:46,428
TIME TO MEET YOUR
PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES.

358
00:14:46,512 --> 00:14:48,555
FIRST UP, MARISOL LEWIS.

359
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:50,557
AUDIENCE:
(APPLAUDS & CHEERS)

360
00:14:52,351 --> 00:14:54,436
I'VE SPENT THE LAST DAY ASKING
STUDENTS WHAT THEY WANT

361
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:55,646
FROM THEIR PRESIDENT.

362
00:14:55,729 --> 00:14:57,272
AND I'VE LISTENED
TO ALL THE REQUESTS,

363
00:14:57,356 --> 00:14:58,607
EVEN THE ILLEGAL ONES.

364
00:14:58,690 --> 00:15:00,442
AND WHILE I WON'T BREAK
THE LAW FOR YOU,

365
00:15:00,526 --> 00:15:03,111
I'LL MAKE SURE NEXT YEAR
IS THE BEST EVER!

366
00:15:03,195 --> 00:15:05,239
AUDIENCE:
(APPLAUDS & CHEERS)

367
00:15:07,282 --> 00:15:10,035
KATIE MATLIN,
YOU'RE UP NEXT.

368
00:15:10,118 --> 00:15:11,453
AUDIENCE:
(APPLAUDS & CHEERS)

369
00:15:11,537 --> 00:15:12,538
GO KATIE!

370
00:15:13,872 --> 00:15:15,958
OKAY, UM, THE REASON
I'M RUNNING

371
00:15:16,041 --> 00:15:18,168
IS I LOVE THIS SCHOOL

372
00:15:18,252 --> 00:15:20,921
AND TOGETHER WE CAN
ACHIEVE OUR GOALS.

373
00:15:21,004 --> 00:15:23,257
(SARCASTICALLY)
SOUNDS SUPER FUN!

374
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:25,300
AUDIENCE:
(LAUGHS & MURMURS)

375
00:15:25,384 --> 00:15:28,637
UM, TELL THE PEOPLE ONE
OF THE MANY REASONS

376
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,722
YOU'D MAKE A PERFECT
PRESIDENT, KATIE.

377
00:15:30,806 --> 00:15:32,641
WELL... I CAN
THINK OF SEVERAL.

378
00:15:32,724 --> 00:15:35,269
YOU SEE, KATIE IS GREAT
AT KEEPING SECRETS.

379
00:15:35,352 --> 00:15:37,271
WHICH IS IMPORTANT
IN POLITICS.

380
00:15:37,354 --> 00:15:40,607
OH, AND SHE'LL STEP ON ANYONE
TO GET WHAT SHE WANTS.

381
00:15:40,691 --> 00:15:44,319
YOU'RE JUDGING ME ABOUT
STEPPING ON PEOPLE?

382
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:46,947
YOU'RE SUCH
A HYPOCRITE!

383
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:50,158
WHO STOLE KC FROM UNDER
HIS BABY-MOMMA'S NOSE?

384
00:15:50,242 --> 00:15:51,243
NOT ME!

385
00:15:51,326 --> 00:15:52,744
YOU'RE A SHAMELESS
HOME WRECKER!

386
00:15:52,828 --> 00:15:54,329
THAT IS NOT TRUE!

387
00:15:54,413 --> 00:15:56,123
YEAH, IT IS.

388
00:15:56,206 --> 00:15:57,499
AUDIENCE:
OOH!

389
00:15:57,583 --> 00:15:59,168
THANK YOU, LADIES!

390
00:15:59,251 --> 00:16:00,794
OKAY, BEFORE WE GET
TOO FAR OFF TRACK,

391
00:16:00,878 --> 00:16:03,172
LET'S MEET YOUR
FINAL CANDIDATE!

392
00:16:03,255 --> 00:16:05,841
AUDIENCE:
(APPLAUDS & CHEERS)

393
00:16:05,924 --> 00:16:08,051
MO MASHKOUR HERE
WITH TWO PROMISES.

394
00:16:08,135 --> 00:16:09,595
I'LL GET FRIES
BACK IN THE CAF.

395
00:16:09,678 --> 00:16:11,263
AND I WON'T HOOK UP
WITH YOUR BOYFRIEND.

396
00:16:11,346 --> 00:16:13,932
AUDIENCE:
(APPLAUDS & WHISTLES)

397
00:16:18,228 --> 00:16:20,814
IT'S NOT WORKING.
IT'S NEVER GONNA WORK!

398
00:16:20,898 --> 00:16:23,025
DR. WESTON:
ELI, ELI, BREATHE.

399
00:16:23,108 --> 00:16:24,484
IN AND OUT.

400
00:16:26,278 --> 00:16:28,697
NOW, TELL ME WHAT'S WRONG.

401
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:31,366
IF JAKE WON'T FORGIVE ME,
I'M NEVER GONNA GET BETTER.

402
00:16:31,450 --> 00:16:32,910
DR. WESTON:
THAT'S NOT TRUE.

403
00:16:32,993 --> 00:16:35,579
BUT YOU SAID APOLOGIZING IS
AN IMPORTANT PART OF RECOVERY.

404
00:16:35,662 --> 00:16:36,747
YOU APOLOGIZED TO JAKE.

405
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:38,874
YOU CANNOT FORCE
PEOPLE TO FORGIVE YOU.

406
00:16:38,957 --> 00:16:39,875
SO WHAT AM I
SUPPOSED TO DO?

407
00:16:39,958 --> 00:16:41,376
WAIT AROUND UNTIL
HE CHANGES HIS MIND?

408
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:42,836
NO, YOU MOVE ON
WITH YOUR LIFE.

409
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:45,422
FIND SOME POSITIVE
ACTIVITIES.

410
00:16:46,423 --> 00:16:48,008
OKAY, THANKS.

411
00:16:48,091 --> 00:16:49,134
(PHONE BEEPS OFF)

412
00:17:00,646 --> 00:17:04,066
MS. OH:
IT WAS RUDE OF ME
TO WALK OUT.

413
00:17:04,149 --> 00:17:05,484
YEAH, IT'S OKAY.

414
00:17:06,568 --> 00:17:08,820
I AM A BIT CONFUSED THOUGH.

415
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:10,948
I THINK IT WOULD
BE BETTER IF WE DIDN'T

416
00:17:11,031 --> 00:17:14,159
SPEND ANY MORE TIME
ALONE OUTSIDE CLASS.

417
00:17:14,243 --> 00:17:15,869
BECAUSE OF THE SONG
YOU WROTE ABOUT US?

418
00:17:15,953 --> 00:17:17,329
OH, SAV.

419
00:17:17,412 --> 00:17:18,330
RIGHT, SORRY.

420
00:17:18,413 --> 00:17:19,706
I'M SUCH A MORON.

421
00:17:19,790 --> 00:17:22,251
A TEACHER WRITING A SONG ABOUT
A STUDENT. IT WOULD JUST BE-

422
00:17:22,334 --> 00:17:23,794
PATHETIC.

423
00:17:23,877 --> 00:17:25,212
NOT EXACTLY WHAT
I WAS GOING FOR.

424
00:17:25,295 --> 00:17:27,506
MORE, TOO GOOD
TO BE TRUE.

425
00:17:27,589 --> 00:17:29,633
WHICH IS WHY I SHOULDN'T
HAVE SUNG IT,

426
00:17:29,716 --> 00:17:33,053
WRITTEN IT,
OR EVEN THOUGHT IT.

427
00:17:33,136 --> 00:17:35,097
SO THE SONG
IS ABOUT ME?

428
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:36,932
I'VE BEEN HAVING FEELINGS,
BUT YOU'RE MY STUDENT.

429
00:17:37,015 --> 00:17:38,100
IT'S WRONG.

430
00:17:39,142 --> 00:17:40,143
DON'T.

431
00:17:43,772 --> 00:17:46,024
♪ Keep me out
of paradise ♪

432
00:17:49,027 --> 00:17:51,655
♪ We're fighting
on the same side ♪

433
00:17:54,867 --> 00:17:56,827
♪ Stranger things
I wish I might... ♪

434
00:18:01,206 --> 00:18:03,292
MY SHRINK THINKS I NEED
A NEW ACTIVITY.

435
00:18:03,375 --> 00:18:05,419
THE RUGBY TEAM'S
LOOKING FOR NEW MEMBERS.

436
00:18:05,502 --> 00:18:06,837
BECAUSE YOU NEED
TO SPEND MORE TIME

437
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:07,963
IN A CAST THIS YEAR?

438
00:18:08,046 --> 00:18:11,133
I AM BORDERING ON INSANITY.
WHY FIGHT IT?

439
00:18:11,216 --> 00:18:12,634
CLARE:
I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND

440
00:18:12,718 --> 00:18:13,927
WHY THIS IS A BIG DEAL.

441
00:18:14,011 --> 00:18:16,096
JAKE:
IT'S AN ARTSY CHICK FLICK.

442
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:17,222
IT'S LIKELY TO BE LAME.

443
00:18:17,306 --> 00:18:18,765
CLARE:
IT'S NOT ABOUT THAT!

444
00:18:18,849 --> 00:18:21,810
JAKE:
WANNA CLUE ME IN HERE?

445
00:18:21,894 --> 00:18:23,687
IT'S ABOUT SPENDING
TIME TOGETHER!

446
00:18:23,770 --> 00:18:25,606
WE'RE TOGETHER RIGHT NOW!

447
00:18:25,689 --> 00:18:27,482
AND I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU,
BUT I'M HAVING A REAL BLAST.

448
00:18:27,566 --> 00:18:29,651
OH, CUT THE SARCASM
FOR ONE MINUTE.

449
00:18:29,735 --> 00:18:32,029
LOOKS LIKE I'VE FOUND
MY NEW ACTIVITY.

450
00:18:32,112 --> 00:18:34,489
(SIGHS) PLEASE TELL ME
IT'S NOT WINNING CLARE BACK.

451
00:18:34,573 --> 00:18:36,200
NO, NO.
I'M DONE WITH THAT.

452
00:18:36,283 --> 00:18:38,160
BUT I KNOW WHAT
MAKES CLARE TICK,

453
00:18:38,243 --> 00:18:40,329
SO I'M GONNA HELP HIM
UNDERSTAND HER,

454
00:18:40,412 --> 00:18:42,122
SO THEY CAN MEND FENCES.
THEN HE HAS TO FORGIVE ME,

455
00:18:42,206 --> 00:18:43,207
RIGHT?

456
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:48,587
RUGBY DOESN'T SOUND
SO CRAZY ANYMORE.

457
00:18:48,670 --> 00:18:49,755
(SIGHS)

458
00:18:50,714 --> 00:18:51,882
MARE? MARE WAIT UP.

459
00:18:51,965 --> 00:18:54,092
THE HOME WRECKER THING,
IT JUST HAPPENED.

460
00:18:54,176 --> 00:18:55,469
LIKE DREW JUST HAPPENED.

461
00:18:55,552 --> 00:18:56,470
I'M SO SORRY!

462
00:18:56,553 --> 00:18:58,514
CAN WE PLEASE JUST
GO BACK TO BEING FRIENDS?

463
00:18:58,597 --> 00:19:00,307
YOU HAVE EVERYTHING.

464
00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:01,934
WHY'D YOU TAKE THE ONE
THING I WANTED?

465
00:19:02,017 --> 00:19:04,144
BECAUSE HE LIKES ME,
MARE!

466
00:19:04,228 --> 00:19:06,396
AND THERE'S A LOT HE
DOESN'T KNOW ABOUT YOU.

467
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,524
LIKE, YOU SPEND
EVERY NIGHT AT SOCCER,

468
00:19:08,607 --> 00:19:10,776
YOU SPEND YOUR LUNCHES
AT THE PAPER,

469
00:19:10,859 --> 00:19:12,986
AND THE ONLY OTHER
GUY YOU'VE EVER KISSED

470
00:19:13,070 --> 00:19:14,863
WAS DURING A GAME
OF TRUTH OR DARE.

471
00:19:14,947 --> 00:19:16,490
THAT'S NOT TRUE.

472
00:19:17,491 --> 00:19:21,578
OH, AND THEN THERE'S
YOUR LITTLE PROBLEM...

473
00:19:23,622 --> 00:19:25,624
YOU PROMISED
YOU'D NEVER TELL.

474
00:19:30,921 --> 00:19:32,047
(BELL RINGS)

475
00:19:32,130 --> 00:19:33,715
HEY JAKE, CAN I TALK
TO YOU AFTER CLASS?

476
00:19:33,799 --> 00:19:35,884
SORRY. KINDA BUSY.

477
00:19:35,968 --> 00:19:37,052
I KNOW,
BUT IT'S KIND OF-

478
00:19:37,135 --> 00:19:38,887
PERINO:
OKAY, KIDS.

479
00:19:38,971 --> 00:19:41,181
SUBJECTS FOR YOUR
FINAL PROJECTS.

480
00:19:41,265 --> 00:19:42,182
LET'S GO.

481
00:19:42,266 --> 00:19:43,725
ELI: SIR?
PERINO: YEAH?

482
00:19:43,809 --> 00:19:46,228
I WAS THINKING ABOUT DOING
A NATIVE SWEAT LODGE.

483
00:19:46,311 --> 00:19:47,563
I ALREADY PITCHED THAT!

484
00:19:47,646 --> 00:19:48,564
DID YOU?

485
00:19:48,647 --> 00:19:50,107
WELL, I'VE DONE
TONS OF RESEARCH.

486
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:52,693
AND I FEEL THAT THE THERAPEUTIC
NATURE OF THE SWEAT LODGE

487
00:19:52,776 --> 00:19:54,736
WOULD COMPLEMENT MY
PSYCHIATRIC RECOVERY.

488
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:56,405
OKAY, PARTNER UP
WITH JAKE THEN.

489
00:19:56,488 --> 00:19:58,490
WELL, I'D LOVE TO,
IF THAT'S COOL WITH JAKE.

490
00:20:01,285 --> 00:20:02,327
SOUNDS SUPER.

491
00:20:02,411 --> 00:20:03,412
PERFECT.

492
00:20:03,495 --> 00:20:05,414
OKAY, WHO'S NEXT?

493
00:20:15,257 --> 00:20:17,509
SO, THE ENTIRE SCHOOL
IS TALKING ABOUT MARISOL,

494
00:20:17,593 --> 00:20:18,510
THE HOME WRECKER.

495
00:20:18,594 --> 00:20:19,928
I'M A TERRIBLE PERSON.

496
00:20:20,012 --> 00:20:21,013
DON'T BEAT YOURSELF
UP ABOUT IT.

497
00:20:21,096 --> 00:20:22,973
SHE KINDA DESERVED IT.

498
00:20:23,974 --> 00:20:25,601
WHY DO YOU LIKE ME?

499
00:20:25,684 --> 00:20:26,602
WHAT?

500
00:20:26,685 --> 00:20:28,520
I'VE ONLY EVER KISSED
TWO OTHER GUYS.

501
00:20:28,604 --> 00:20:30,606
I HAD NO IDEA
YOU WERE THAT EASY.

502
00:20:30,689 --> 00:20:33,692
I'M NOT BEING
FACETIOUS, DREW.

503
00:20:34,693 --> 00:20:36,570
OKAY, I-I DON'T
KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS.

504
00:20:36,653 --> 00:20:39,656
BUT I DO KNOW THAT
YOU SAW ME AT MY WORST.

505
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,452
AND YOU STUCK AROUND.

506
00:20:43,535 --> 00:20:45,621
I DON'T JUST LIKE YOU.

507
00:20:45,704 --> 00:20:47,706
KATIE, I NEED YOU.

508
00:20:52,461 --> 00:20:54,463
HEY, SORRY TO INTERRUPT.

509
00:20:57,466 --> 00:20:59,051
I WANNA LET YOU
KNOW HOW TERRIBLE

510
00:20:59,134 --> 00:21:01,970
I FEEL ABOUT EVERYTHING
THAT'S HAPPENED.

511
00:21:02,054 --> 00:21:02,971
YOU REALLY MEAN THAT?

512
00:21:03,055 --> 00:21:05,933
ABSOLUTELY. AND I HOPE
THE STRESS OF THE SITUATION

513
00:21:06,016 --> 00:21:08,268
DOESN'T MAKE YOUR
LITTLE PROBLEM WORSE.

514
00:21:09,811 --> 00:21:11,772
WHAT LITTLE PROBLEM?

515
00:21:11,855 --> 00:21:16,652
OH, I ASSUMED YOU TOLD DREW
ABOUT YOUR URGE TO PURGE.

516
00:21:16,735 --> 00:21:17,861
WHAT'S SHE
TALKING ABOUT?

517
00:21:17,945 --> 00:21:18,904
KATIE'S BULIMIC.

518
00:21:18,987 --> 00:21:20,322
THAT'S NOT TRUE!

519
00:21:20,405 --> 00:21:21,990
YOU SHOULDN'T BE ASHAMED.

520
00:21:22,074 --> 00:21:24,409
LOTS OF GIRLS HAVE
EATING DISORDERS.

521
00:21:29,373 --> 00:21:31,291
SHE'S JUST TRYING
TO CAUSE TROUBLE.

522
00:21:31,375 --> 00:21:32,292
HEY, HEY, HEY.
IT'S OKAY.

523
00:21:32,376 --> 00:21:33,293
NO ONE WOULD
EVER BELIEVE

524
00:21:33,377 --> 00:21:35,212
THAT YOU HAVE
AN EATING DISORDER.

525
00:21:35,295 --> 00:21:37,422
BECAUSE THAT WOULD
BE PATHETIC.

526
00:21:37,506 --> 00:21:39,675
AND YOU'RE ANYTHING
BUT PATHETIC.

527
00:21:39,758 --> 00:21:42,052
♪ Knocked down in the sand ♪

528
00:21:43,595 --> 00:21:45,889
♪ But there's no turning back ♪

529
00:21:48,267 --> 00:21:49,268
♪ There's no turning back ♪
