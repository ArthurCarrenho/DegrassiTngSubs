IMPRESS HER.

140
00:06:18,504 --> 00:06:19,922
CLARE'S ALREADY IMPRESSED.

141
00:06:20,005 --> 00:06:20,964
SO WHEN YOU'RE DRIVING
HER AROUND

142
00:06:21,048 --> 00:06:21,965

143
00:06:22,049 --> 00:06:26,303

00:07:09,263 --> 00:07:10,597
YEAH,
ALLI TOLD ME YESTERDAY.

160
00:07:10,681 --> 00:07:13,600

00:07:18,772 --> 00:07:20,816
YOU CHEATED WITH MARISOL.

164
00:07:20,899 --> 00:07:23,277
OBVIOUSLY JENNA'S
MOVING OUT!

165
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,279
ALLI'S ACTING LIKE
IT'S ONE BIG SLEEPOVER.

166
00:07:25,362 --> 00:07:26,738
SHE'S MOVING IN
WITH ALLI?!

167
00:07:26,822 --> 00:07:27,781
WELL, SHORT-TERM.

168
00:07:27,865 --> 00:07:29,658
ME AND ALLI HAD TO VOUCH
FOR JENNA WITH HER PARENTS.

169
00:07:32,995 --> 00:07:34,872
I THOUGHT WE'D MAKE IT
THROUGH THE ADOPTION

170
00:07:34,955 --> 00:07:36,999
AND THEN MAYBE
AFTER A COUPLE WEEKS...

171
00:07:37,082 --> 00:07:39,376
AND THEN WHAT?
GET BACK TOGETHER?

172
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:40,377
HAPPILY EVER AFTER?

173
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:42,296
IT COULD HAPPEN.

174
00:07:42,379 --> 00:07:44,006
I'VE JUST GOT TO FIND A WAY
TO GET HER TO STAY.

175
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:47,551
GOOD LUCK WITH THAT.

176
00:07:47,634 --> 00:07:48,635
(BELL RINGS)

177
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:56,768
OKAY, SO...

178
00:07:58,145 --> 00:08:01,064
WOULD YOU RATHER,
A: FLY A PLANE;

179
00:08:01,148 --> 00:08:02,858
B: FIX A PLANE;

180
00:08:03,942 --> 00:08:06,111
C: BE A PASSENGER
ON A PLANE;

181
00:08:06,195 --> 00:08:08,155
OR D: BE A BIRD?

182
00:08:11,074 --> 00:08:12,576
IS THAT AN ACTUAL QUESTION?

183
00:08:12,659 --> 00:08:15,287
WELL, I MAYBE MADE UP
THE LAST CHOICE.

184
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:19,249
ANYA:
UM, ANY CHANCE THAT YOU
WANNA CHECK OUT A CAREER FAIR?

185
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:20,626
WITH YOUR MOM?

186
00:08:20,709 --> 00:08:21,668
OH, SHE'LL LOVE YOU.

187
00:08:21,752 --> 00:08:23,170
UH...
C'MON!

188
00:08:25,422 --> 00:08:26,590
ANYA:
UM...

189
00:08:26,673 --> 00:08:29,426
HEY, MOM, THIS IS OWEN.
WE'RE DATING.

190
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:31,261
OH, HI.
NICE TO MEET YOU.

191
00:08:31,345 --> 00:08:32,429
I'M PAM.

192
00:08:32,513 --> 00:08:34,181
NICE TO MEET YOU, TOO.

193
00:08:34,264 --> 00:08:37,226
UM, OWEN'S GONNA COME
TO THE CAREER FAIR WITH US.

194
00:08:37,309 --> 00:08:39,102
UH, IT LOOKS LIKE
I'M NOT THE ONLY ONE

195
00:08:39,186 --> 00:08:40,270
WHO DOESN'T HAVE
MY WHOLE LIFE FIGURED OUT,

196
00:08:40,354 --> 00:08:41,855
RIGHT?
(LAUGHS)

197
00:08:41,939 --> 00:08:44,775
(LAUGHS)
I GOT A FEW IDEAS.

198
00:08:44,858 --> 00:08:47,611
YEAH, SURE,
EVERYBODY'S GOT A FEW IDEAS.

199
00:08:47,694 --> 00:08:50,531
UH, I WANNA GET
MY COACHING CERTIFICATE.

200
00:08:50,614 --> 00:08:51,990
ANYA: WHAT?
OWEN: YEAH!

201
00:08:52,074 --> 00:08:53,075
PLAY MY WAY THROUGH COLLEGE,

202
00:08:53,158 --> 00:08:54,076
AND THEN ONE DAY

203
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:55,953
I HOPE TO WORK
WITH THE NATIONAL TEAM.

204
00:08:56,036 --> 00:08:57,746
OH! YOU SOUND LIKE A MAN
WITH A PLAN.

205
00:08:57,829 --> 00:08:58,747
I'M IMPRESSED.

206
00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:01,917
YEAH, WELL, I MEAN,
I'M NO DOCTOR, BUT...

207
00:09:03,669 --> 00:09:07,089
(SOUND OF CAR DOOR OPENING
AND CLOSING)

208
00:09:07,172 --> 00:09:08,382
WAIT! SWITCH DRINKS!

209
00:09:09,383 --> 00:09:10,676
FINE BY ME.

210
00:09:11,677 --> 00:09:12,636
SWITCH DRINKS, RILEY.

211
00:09:12,719 --> 00:09:14,555
SORRY, UM...

212
00:09:14,638 --> 00:09:16,640
I MEAN, FINE BY ME
AS WELL.

213
00:09:16,723 --> 00:09:18,267
OKAY, NOW YOU DRINK.

214
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:19,643
YOU THROW IT BEHIND
THE ROULETTE TABLE;

215
00:09:19,726 --> 00:09:21,311
YOU GRAB THE KNIFE
THAT'S HIDDEN BESIDE CHANTAY;

216
00:09:21,395 --> 00:09:22,688
YOU LUNGE AT ME,
I BLOCK IT-

217
00:09:22,771 --> 00:09:24,439
WHOA, HOLD ON.
I DRINK?

218
00:09:24,523 --> 00:09:25,816
OKAY, THIS ISN'T
THAT DIFFICULT.

219
00:09:25,899 --> 00:09:27,901
HE JUST GOT THE SCRIPT.
CAN WE GO SLOWER?

220
00:09:27,985 --> 00:09:29,528
SLOWER.
WE CAN'T GO SLOWER.

221
00:09:29,611 --> 00:09:30,821
ARE YOU OKAY?

222
00:09:30,904 --> 00:09:32,990
(YELLS) YES!
I'M FINE!

223
00:09:33,073 --> 00:09:34,324
EVERYONE JUST NEEDS
TO WORK HARDER!

224
00:09:34,408 --> 00:09:36,994
THIS HAS TO BE PERFECT.
I WANT IT PERFECT!

225
00:09:37,077 --> 00:09:39,329
OKAY, TAKE FIVE,
EVERYBODY.

226
00:09:42,332 --> 00:09:44,001
WHY ARE YOU YELLING
AT EVERYONE?

227
00:09:44,084 --> 00:09:45,377
AND WHAT IS RILEY
DOING HERE?

228
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:46,378
HE'S PLAYING JACK.

229
00:09:46,461 --> 00:09:47,838
WHAT HAPPENED TO JAKE?

230
00:09:47,921 --> 00:09:49,381
I FIRED HIM.

231
00:09:49,464 --> 00:09:53,135
OKAY, THAT'S IT.
WE'RE GOING TO DAWES.

232
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:58,390
IMOGEN:
ARI, THERE'S ENOUGH ROOM
FOR YOU

233
00:09:58,473 --> 00:10:00,893
AND JACK IN THE WORLD!

234
00:10:01,894 --> 00:10:04,897
BUT...NOT IN YOUR HEART,
CLARA.

235
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:07,316
NOT IN YOUR HEART.

236
00:10:07,399 --> 00:10:08,984
AND... SCENE.

237
00:10:09,067 --> 00:10:11,695
WELL, IMOGEN IS ALREADY
OFF-BOOK.

238
00:10:11,778 --> 00:10:14,615
LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE
HALFWAY THERE.

239
00:10:14,698 --> 00:10:16,158
FIONA:
MS. DAWES, THEY'RE PUTTING
ON A GOOD SHOW HERE,

240
00:10:16,241 --> 00:10:17,492
BUT WITH ALL THESE CHANGES,

241
00:10:17,576 --> 00:10:19,244
THE PLAY'S GONNA BE
A DISASTER.

242
00:10:19,328 --> 00:10:20,412
ELI?

243
00:10:20,495 --> 00:10:24,208
MS. DAWES, I HAD TO MAKE
THESE CHANGES BECAUSE...

244
00:10:24,291 --> 00:10:25,709
IT'S ABOUT...

245
00:10:25,792 --> 00:10:27,961
HAVING THE COURAGE
TO WRITE A HAPPY ENDING.

246
00:10:28,045 --> 00:10:31,340
LIKE IF SHAKESPEARE DECIDED
TO REWRITE ROMEO AND JULIET.

247
00:10:31,423 --> 00:10:32,341
INSTEAD OF A TRAGEDY,

248
00:10:32,424 --> 00:10:33,550
CHANGING IT
TO GIVE THE AUDIENCE HOPE;

249
00:10:33,634 --> 00:10:35,928
TO HAVE THE TWO PEOPLE
WHO ARE SUPPOSED TO BE TOGETHER

250
00:10:36,011 --> 00:10:37,346
WALK OFF INTO THE SUNSET...

251
00:10:37,429 --> 00:10:38,680
A WRITER'S CATHARSIS?

252
00:10:38,764 --> 00:10:40,098
ELI:
EXACTLY!

253
00:10:40,182 --> 00:10:42,851
THIS TWIST ENDING
WILL PUT THIS PLAY OVER THE TOP.

254
00:10:42,935 --> 00:10:43,852
GIVE ME A BREAK.

255
00:10:43,936 --> 00:10:45,312
WHO EVEN KNOWS
WHAT HE'S TALKING ABOUT?

256
00:10:45,395 --> 00:10:46,897
I DO.

257
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:47,898
NO OFFENSE, FIONA,

258
00:10:47,981 --> 00:10:49,608
BUT YOU DON'T HAVE
THE EXPERIENCE WITH PLAYS

259
00:10:49,691 --> 00:10:50,567
LIKE I DO.

260
00:10:50,651 --> 00:10:52,027
YOU'RE NOT AN ARTIST.

261
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:54,112
OKAY, FINE.
DO WHATEVER YOU WANT,

262
00:10:54,196 --> 00:10:56,365
BUT I WON'T BE RESPONSIBLE
FOR A PLAY THAT BOMBS.

263
00:10:56,448 --> 00:10:58,325
I KNOW CREATIVE DIFFERENCES
ARE COMMON,

264
00:10:58,408 --> 00:11:01,537
BUT YOU TWO STARTED OUT
LIKE A DREAM TEAM.

265
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:02,663
WHY ISN'T IT
WORKING ANYMORE?

266
00:11:05,832 --> 00:11:09,127
OKAY, FIONA,
THE SHOW MUST GO ON.

267
00:11:22,266 --> 00:11:24,059
IMOGEN:
YOU'RE STILL NOT TAKING
YOUR MEDS, ARE YOU?

268
00:11:24,142 --> 00:11:26,395
I'VE BEEN OFF THEM FOR WEEKS
AND I FEEL AWESOME.

269
00:11:26,478 --> 00:11:28,438
YOU STOPPED TAKING THEM
TO UNBLOCK YOUR CREATIVITY

270
00:11:28,522 --> 00:11:30,399
SO YOU COULD
WRITE THE PLAY.

271
00:11:30,482 --> 00:11:32,568
BUT NOW THAT PLAY
IS ALREADY WRITTEN...

272
00:11:32,651 --> 00:11:34,945
OKAY, FORGET ABOUT
THE PILLS.

273
00:11:35,028 --> 00:11:35,988
WE'VE NEED TO GET
THE WORD OUT

274
00:11:36,071 --> 00:11:37,948
ABOUT THIS AMAZING
TWIST ENDING

275
00:11:38,031 --> 00:11:40,367
FOR LOVE ROULETTE NOW.

276
00:11:42,452 --> 00:11:44,079
WILL YOU TELL EVERYONE
YOU KNOW?

277
00:11:44,162 --> 00:11:45,163
OF COURSE.

278
00:11:46,164 --> 00:11:47,416
(KISS)

279
00:11:49,001 --> 00:11:52,880
AND I KNOW EXACTLY
WHO I NEED TO TALK TO.

280
00:11:57,301 --> 00:11:58,802
(BELL RINGS)

281
00:12:02,014 --> 00:12:03,765
HEY.

282
00:12:03,849 --> 00:12:06,101
I GOT THESE FOR YOU.

283
00:12:06,185 --> 00:12:08,437
I MADE A MISTAKE
WITH MARISOL.

284
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:11,273
IT WAS STUPID
AND SELFISH,

285
00:12:11,356 --> 00:12:12,566
AND I'M SORRY.

286
00:12:12,649 --> 00:12:14,443
OKAY.

287
00:12:14,526 --> 00:12:17,321
THANKS FOR THE APOLOGY.

288
00:12:17,404 --> 00:12:19,865
CAN WE MAYBE
UN-BREAK UP?

289
00:12:20,866 --> 00:12:22,242
(SIGHS)
LOOK, KC,

290
00:12:23,243 --> 00:12:25,787
THE TRUTH IS,
IF IT WEREN'T FOR THE BABY,

291
00:12:25,871 --> 00:12:27,122
I'M NOT SURE
WE WOULD'VE STAYED TOGETHER

292
00:12:27,206 --> 00:12:27,956
THIS WHOLE TIME.

293
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:30,584
I DON'T BELIEVE THAT,
JENNA.

294
00:12:30,667 --> 00:12:31,960
LOOK, I LOVE YOU.

295
00:12:32,044 --> 00:12:33,629
JUST TELL ME WHAT YOU WANT ME
TO DO AND I'LL DO IT.

296
00:12:33,712 --> 00:12:34,963
THE ONLY THING I WANT

297
00:12:35,047 --> 00:12:37,925
IS TO FIND THE BEST HOME
WE CAN FOR TY.

298
00:12:40,344 --> 00:12:41,345
(SIGHS)

299
00:12:46,058 --> 00:12:48,143
PRESS GIRL!
I'VE GOT A SCOOP FOR YA!

300
00:12:48,227 --> 00:12:49,770
HEY, ELI.

301
00:12:49,853 --> 00:12:50,979
I WONDERED IF YOU COULD DO
A LAST-MINUTE ARTICLE

302
00:12:51,063 --> 00:12:52,189
ON LOVE ROULETTE.

303
00:12:52,272 --> 00:12:53,982
AH. I HEARD THERE
WERE CHANGES,

304
00:12:54,066 --> 00:12:56,151
AND...YOU FIRED JAKE?

305
00:12:58,153 --> 00:12:59,947
UH, YEAH. THAT.

306
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:02,991
HE WAS JUST A CASUALTY
OF THE CREATIVE PROCESS.

307
00:13:03,075 --> 00:13:03,992
DID HE SAY ANYTHING
TO YOU?

308
00:13:04,076 --> 00:13:04,993
NOT REALLY.

309
00:13:05,077 --> 00:13:07,079
I THINK YOU DID HIM
A FAVOUR, ACTUALLY.

310
00:13:07,162 --> 00:13:08,497
WELL, NOT EVERYONE
LOVES THEATRE.

311
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:11,166
NOT THE WAY YOU
AND I DO.

312
00:13:13,418 --> 00:13:15,587
SO HOW ABOUT
THAT INTERVIEW?

313
00:13:15,671 --> 00:13:17,172
I'M KIND OF IN
THE MIDDLE OF SOMETHING.

314
00:13:17,256 --> 00:13:18,882
OF COURSE.
HOW ABOUT LATER?

315
00:13:18,966 --> 00:13:21,093
SEVEN-ISH, SAY,
AT THE DOT?

316
00:13:21,176 --> 00:13:23,178
SURE. LET'S DO IT.

317
00:13:23,262 --> 00:13:24,596
THEN IT'S A DATE.

318
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:25,639
IT'S AN INTERVIEW.

319
00:13:25,722 --> 00:13:28,100
ISN'T THAT WHAT I SAID?

320
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:39,152
♪ Get up, get up, get up for ♪

321
00:13:40,153 --> 00:13:42,614
♪ Get up, get up, get up for ♪

322
00:13:43,615 --> 00:13:45,200
YOU'RE UP.

323
00:13:45,284 --> 00:13:46,285
ANYA.

324
00:13:47,286 --> 00:13:49,204
THREE HUNDRED BOOTHS
AT A CAREER FAIR

325
00:13:49,288 --> 00:13:50,205
AND NOT ONE -

326
00:13:50,289 --> 00:13:52,499
NOT ONE IS EVEN REMOTELY
APPEALING TO ME.

327
00:13:52,583 --> 00:13:53,500
(LAUGHS) WHAT?

328
00:13:53,584 --> 00:13:54,626
YOU DON'T THINK
YOU HAVE A FUTURE

329
00:13:54,710 --> 00:13:56,086
IN TELEVISION REPAIR?

330
00:13:56,170 --> 00:13:57,421
HILARIOUS, OWEN.

331
00:13:57,504 --> 00:14:00,340
YOU KNOW, YOU REALLY
SUCKED UP TO MY MOM.

332
00:14:00,424 --> 00:14:02,050
I MADE A GOOD IMPRESSION.

333
00:14:02,134 --> 00:14:03,343
YOU MADE ME
LOOK LIKE AN IDIOT.

334
00:14:03,427 --> 00:14:04,344
I BROUGHT YOU ALONG
FOR SUPPORT.

335
00:14:04,428 --> 00:14:05,804
YOU SHOULD'VE
JUST PLAYED ALONG.

336
00:14:05,888 --> 00:14:07,181
ALL RIGHT, I UNDERSTAND
THAT YOU'RE UPSET, OKAY?

337
00:14:07,264 --> 00:14:08,265
BUT DON'T TAKE IT OUT
ON ME.

338
00:14:10,309 --> 00:14:12,269
YOU WILL FIND SOMETHING
EVENTUALLY.

339
00:14:12,352 --> 00:14:14,771
NOT EVERYBODY HAS IT
ALL FIGURED OUT.

340
00:14:14,855 --> 00:14:16,315
LIKE YOU DO?

341
00:14:16,398 --> 00:14:18,066
YOU MUST THINK
I'M A REAL LOSER, THEN.

342
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:19,067
I DIDN'T SAY THAT.

343
00:14:19,151 --> 00:14:20,944
YEAH, WELL,
YOU DON'T HAVE TO SAY IT!

344
00:14:23,113 --> 00:14:24,114
WHA?!

345
00:14:32,748 --> 00:14:35,501
TY'S A REALLY GOOD BABY.

346
00:14:35,584 --> 00:14:38,837
HE'S A GREAT SLEEPER
AND IF HE CRIES,

347
00:14:38,921 --> 00:14:41,673
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO
IS PLAY HIM SOME MUSIC

348
00:14:41,757 --> 00:14:42,674
AND HE'S HAPPY AGAIN.

349
00:14:42,758 --> 00:14:43,675
