GALILEO'S GOT NOTHING ON YOU

524
00:19:36,134 --> 00:19:37,928
WHEN IT COMES
TO RUBE GOLDBERGS!

525
00:19:38,011 --> 00:19:39,680
LET'S SEE
IF IT WAS GOOD ENOUGH.

526
00:19:39,763 --> 00:19:41,682
MR. BETENKAMP:
MORNING, CLASS!

527
00:19:41,765 --> 00:19:43,475
YEAH, I KNOW YOU'RE ALL WAITING
ON PINS AND NEEDLES

528
00:19:43,559 --> 00:19:46,603
TO FIND OUT WHO'S GOING
TO THE CITY WIDE COMPETITION!

529
00:19:46,687 --> 00:19:48,230
AND THE WAIT IS OVER.

530
00:19:48,313 --> 00:19:50,566
THE WINNING TEAM IS...

531
00:19:50,649 --> 00:19:52,776
LIAM, HANNAH, AND WESLEY.

532
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:53,861
CONGRATS!

533
00:19:55,195 --> 00:19:57,239
(SMATTERING OF APPLAUSE)

534
00:19:57,322 --> 00:19:59,449
HANNAH: YOU NAILED IT!
WESLEY: IT WAS A TEAM EFFORT.

535
00:19:59,533 --> 00:20:00,784
WHERE ARE WE CELEBRATING
TONIGHT?

536
00:20:00,868 --> 00:20:01,785
YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN.

537
00:20:01,869 --> 00:20:04,413
I'M GROUNDED
'TIL HALLEY'S COMET RETURNS.

538
00:20:04,496 --> 00:20:08,000
YEAH...
I GUESS I DESERVED IT THOUGH.

539
00:20:08,083 --> 00:20:12,045
OKAY, I HAVE NO IDEA
WHY YOU LIKE ME!

540
00:20:12,129 --> 00:20:14,381
BECAUSE... YOU'RE YOU.

541
00:20:16,091 --> 00:20:18,302
BUT WHEN YOU
DOUBT YOURSELF,

542
00:20:18,385 --> 00:20:21,305
IT MAKES YOU DO
STUPID THINGS.

543
00:20:21,388 --> 00:20:22,806
AGREED.

544
00:20:22,890 --> 00:20:25,058
I'M SO SORRY
I PUT YOU THROUGH ALL THAT.

545
00:20:25,142 --> 00:20:26,518
SO, AFTER SCHOOL,

546
00:20:26,602 --> 00:20:28,687
SHALL WE CELEBRATE
ON THE 506?

547
00:20:28,770 --> 00:20:30,314
MY BUS DOESN'T GO YOUR WAY.

548
00:20:30,439 --> 00:20:32,566
MY WAY IS WHEREVER
YOU'RE GOING, DUMMY.

549
00:20:33,650 --> 00:20:34,651
OH!

550
00:20:36,028 --> 00:20:37,029
(SIGHS HEAVILY)

551
00:20:39,198 --> 00:20:40,115
WHAT'RE YOU DOING HERE?

552
00:20:40,199 --> 00:20:41,408
WELL, YOU'RE IGNORING
MY CALLS!

553
00:20:41,491 --> 00:20:42,784
I'M NOT SUPPOSED TO BE
AROUND YOU ANYMORE.

554
00:20:42,868 --> 00:20:44,036
SAYS WHO?
YOUR PARENTS?

555
00:20:44,119 --> 00:20:46,038
YOU'RE LUCKY MY DAD WAS
THE ONLY COP THAT SHOWED UP!

556
00:20:46,121 --> 00:20:47,497
WELL, YOU DIDN'T HAVE
TO CALL HIM!

557
00:20:47,581 --> 00:20:49,666
ALLI, YOU WOULDN'T LEAVE
THE GAME!

558
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:51,126
MY DAD SAVED US
FROM A BEAT DOWN!

559
00:20:51,210 --> 00:20:52,711
WELL, NOW WE HAVE TO DO
MAJOR DAMAGE CONTROL

560
00:20:52,794 --> 00:20:54,046
IF YOU EVER WANT
TO COME VISIT ME.

561
00:20:54,129 --> 00:20:56,215
MY DAD STOPPED
AN ILLEGAL POKER GAME

562
00:20:56,298 --> 00:20:57,758
STARRING YOU
AND YOUR SCIENCE SCHOLARSHIP.

563
00:20:57,841 --> 00:20:59,468
IT'S NOT HAPPENING.

564
00:21:01,970 --> 00:21:04,723
WELL, WHAT IF WE DID
THAT DINNER?

565
00:21:04,806 --> 00:21:08,393
I COULD MEET YOUR PARENTS,
SHOW THEM THE REAL ALLI?

566
00:21:08,477 --> 00:21:09,853
WHO'S THAT?

567
00:21:11,396 --> 00:21:14,066
LOOK, ALLI,
I LIKE YOU.

568
00:21:14,149 --> 00:21:18,570
BUT THE FACT IS,
YOU'RE GOING AWAY ALL SUMMER.

569
00:21:18,654 --> 00:21:20,739
ARE WE BREAKING UP?

570
00:21:22,783 --> 00:21:23,700
LET'S JUST SEE
WHERE WE'RE AT

571
00:21:23,784 --> 00:21:25,494
WHEN YOU GET BACK.

572
00:21:25,577 --> 00:21:28,664
BUT A LOT CAN HAPPEN
IN TWO MONTHS.
