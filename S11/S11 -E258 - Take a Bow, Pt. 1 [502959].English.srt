OKAY, LOOK.

178
00:07:16,395 --> 00:07:17,855
I KNOW YOU THINK
I'M PATHETIC,

179
00:07:17,938 --> 00:07:18,897
BUT I NEED YOUR HELP.

180
00:07:18,981 --> 00:07:20,732
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

181
00:07:21,733 --> 00:07:23,694
(WHISPERS)
I DON'T HELP COKE-HEADS.

182
00:07:23,777 --> 00:07:25,863
SO THAT'S WHAT YOU
THINK OF ME?

183
00:07:25,946 --> 00:07:28,740
LOOK,
MY COKE ERA IS OVER.

184
00:07:28,824 --> 00:07:29,741
IT'S IN THE PAST.

185
00:07:29,825 --> 00:07:30,742
I WANNA FORGET
ABOUT IT.

186
00:07:30,826 --> 00:07:32,452
YEAH, ME TOO.

187
00:07:34,288 --> 00:07:36,373
I MADE IT
INTO THE ARMY.

188
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:38,834
BUT IF I CAN'T DO
ONE LOUSY CHIN-UP,

189
00:07:38,917 --> 00:07:41,086
I'M NOT GONNA CUT IT.

190
00:07:41,170 --> 00:07:42,880
AND YOU'RE SERIOUS
ABOUT THIS?

191
00:07:42,963 --> 00:07:43,881
I'VE NEVER BEEN
MORE SERIOUS

192
00:07:43,964 --> 00:07:46,508
ABOUT ANYTHING
IN MY LIFE.

193
00:07:46,592 --> 00:07:48,510
YOU'D HAVE TO BE

YEAH, I WILL!
TOTALLY COMMITTED.

196
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:57,978

YOU'RE GOING WITH DREW.

FOR IT?

210
00:08:20,792 --> 00:08:21,710
FOR WHAT?

00:08:21,793 --> 00:08:23,795
UH, AFTERWARDS?

212
00:08:24,796 --> 00:08:27,174
HOW DID YOU GET SEX
FROM A PROM DATE?

213
00:08:27,257 --> 00:08:29,426
DID HE, AT ANY POINT,
SAY THE WORD "SPECIAL"?

214
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:31,595

223
00:08:44,149 --> 00:08:45,150
DREW'S SWEET.

224
00:08:45,234 --> 00:08:47,361
HE'S SEEN ME AT MY WORST
AND HE STILL LIKES ME.

225
00:08:47,444 --> 00:08:48,737

226
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:51,406

00:08:58,622 --> 00:09:01,208
I'M NOT READY.
WHAT AM I GONNA DO?

233
00:09:02,209 --> 00:09:04,586
UH, OTHER THAN TELL HIM
THE TRUTH?

234
00:09:06,672 --> 00:09:08,924

HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN
STANDING THERE?

240
00:09:33,407 --> 00:09:34,324
I JUST CAME IN,

241
00:09:34,408 --> 00:09:35,617
BUT YOU JUST SEEMED
SO INTENSE,

242
00:09:35,701 --> 00:09:36,827

I'M REALLY SORRY.

246
00:09:40,747 --> 00:09:42,165
FIONA, SLOW DOWN.

247
00:09:42,249 --> 00:09:45,043
(LAUGHS)
WELL, I CAME...

248
00:09:45,127 --> 00:09:47,045
BECAUSE I CAN'T STOP
THINKING

249
00:09:47,129 --> 00:09:48,839
ABOUT HOW AWFUL
I WAS TO YOU.

250
00:09:48,922 --> 00:09:50,007
IT WAS SO UNFAIR OF ME

251
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:51,675
TO JUST INVITE YOU
TO MOVE IN

252
00:09:51,758 --> 00:09:53,760
AND THEN KICK YOU OUT
FOR NO REASON AT ALL.

253
00:09:53,844 --> 00:09:55,679
WE BOTH RUSHED INTO THINGS
TOO SOON.

254
00:09:55,762 --> 00:09:57,389
STILL, I SHOULD'VE BEEN
HONEST WITH YOU

255
00:09:57,472 --> 00:09:58,807
ABOUT BEING AN ALCOHOLIC.

256
00:09:58,891 --> 00:09:59,975
IT'S IN THE PAST.

257
00:10:00,058 --> 00:10:01,018
YOU KNOW,
AFTER THINGS ENDED,

258
00:10:01,101 --> 00:10:02,728
I CHANNELLED MY HEARTBREAK
INTO ART

259
00:10:02,811 --> 00:10:04,855
AND NOW I'M PUTTING ON
A SHOW.

260
00:10:04,938 --> 00:10:06,648
SO WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS,

NO SURPRISE THERE.

267
00:10:18,785 --> 00:10:19,995
CHARLIE, THAT SUCKS.

268
00:10:20,078 --> 00:10:21,914
IT'S OKAY.
I CAN HANDLE IT.

269
00:10:21,997 --> 00:10:22,915
WORST PART IS

270
00:10:22,998 --> 00:10:23,916
IS THAT SHE KICKED
MR. TUXEDO PANTS OUT,

271
00:10:23,999 --> 00:10:26,919
SO POOR GUY'S COOPED UP
IN THE GALLERY.

AWW! POOR LITTLE KITTY!

273
00:10:28,879 --> 00:10:30,047
CHARLIE:
YEAH.

274
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:31,381
MR. TUXEDO PANTS
COULD STAY WITH ME

275
00:10:31,465 --> 00:10:32,841
FOR A FEW DAYS.

276
00:10:32,925 --> 00:10:35,677
REALLY?
ARE YOU SURE?

277
00:10:35,761 --> 00:10:37,638
YEAH, I MEAN,
HE'LL BE RIGHT AT HOME

278
00:10:37,721 --> 00:10:38,972
AND I COULD USE
THE COMPANY.

279
00:10:39,056 --> 00:10:40,641
(SIGHS)
THAT WOULD BE HUGE!

280
00:10:40,724 --> 00:10:42,226
HOW COULD I REPAY YOU?

281
00:10:42,309 --> 00:10:45,646
WELL, YOU COULD BE
MY DATE TO PROM?

282
00:10:46,647 --> 00:10:47,564

THIS YEAR

283

00:12:49,436 --> 00:12:50,979
CAN YOU DO A 15K RUN

351
00:12:51,063 --> 00:12:51,980
NOT YET, BUT-

352
00:12:52,064 --> 00:12:53,065
WELL, THEN YOU DON'T
HAVE TIME

353
00:12:53,148 --> 00:12:54,066
FOR BABY STEPS!

354
00:12:54,149 --> 00:12:55,067
I NEED A MINUTE!

355
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:56,068
OKAY, WELL,
IF YOU WANNA QUIT,

356
00:12:56,151 --> 00:12:57,736
I'VE GOT BETTER THINGS
I COULD BE DOING WITH MY TIME,

00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:02,741

362
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,081
NO, NO, NO!
ON YOUR TOES, LIKE A MAN.

363
00:13:11,083 --> 00:13:12,209
ONE. TWO.

364
00:13:13,210 --> 00:13:14,336
TWO.

365
00:13:14,419 --> 00:13:16,296
(GRUNTS)
I HATE YOU.

366
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:17,381
OWEN:
TWO.

367
00:13:23,595 --> 00:13:26,348
GUESTS:
(QUIET CHATTER)

368
00:13:26,431 --> 00:13:29,184
CHARLIE:
...SPECIFICALLY THE LIGHTING
TO HAVE IT ON ONE SIDE

369
00:13:29,268 --> 00:13:30,435
AS OPPOSED TO HAVING IT...

370
00:13:32,229 --> 00:13:34,606
UM, I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

371
00:13:36,358 --> 00:13:37,359
YOU CAME!

372
00:13:38,735 --> 00:13:40,571
BOTH:
(SQUEAL, GIGGLE)

373
00:13:41,572 --> 00:13:42,906
UH, AND I FORGOT
TO MENTION

374
00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:44,241
THAT THERE'D BE ALCOHOL.

375
00:13:44,324 --> 00:13:47,369
NO, I'LL BE FINE.
WOW! LOOK AT YOU.

376
00:13:47,452 --> 00:13:48,704
ARE YOU SURE?

377
00:13:48,787 --> 00:13:49,705
TOTALLY.

378
00:13:49,788 --> 00:13:50,622
OKAY, GOOD.

379
00:13:50,706 --> 00:13:52,583
'CAUSE THERE'S SOMETHING
I WANT YOU TO SEE.

380
00:13:52,666 --> 00:13:54,418
OKAY! (GIGGLES)

381
00:13:56,211 --> 00:13:58,380
CHARLIE:
(SIGHS) SO,
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

382
00:13:58,463 --> 00:14:00,757
DID THE ARTIST
DO HER SUBJECT JUSTICE?

383
00:14:00,841 --> 00:14:04,386
FIONA:
CHARLIE, IT'S...
IT'S BREATHTAKING.

384
00:14:04,469 --> 00:14:07,222
HA! WELL, I CAN'T TAKE
ALL THE CREDIT.

385
00:14:07,306 --> 00:14:08,932
IT'S EASY WHEN THE MODEL
LOOKS LIKE YOU.

386
00:14:13,061 --> 00:14:15,480
SO, THERE ARE A LOT
OF PEOPLE HERE.

387
00:14:15,564 --> 00:14:18,066
AND NOT ONE PAINTING
HAS SOLD.

388
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:19,234
I'VE REAPPLIED DEODORANT
TWICE,

389
00:14:19,318 --> 00:14:21,028
I AM SO ANXIOUS.

390
00:14:21,111 --> 00:14:23,238
WELL, IT'S EARLY.
I'M SURE THINGS'LL PICK UP.

391
00:14:23,322 --> 00:14:24,323
I MEAN, WHO WOULDN'T
WANT THIS FACE

392
00:14:24,406 --> 00:14:25,741
IN THEIR LIVING ROOM?

393
00:14:25,824 --> 00:14:27,117
YEAH, I COULDN'T AGREE
WITH YOU MORE.

394
00:14:27,201 --> 00:14:29,119
SORRY TO INTERRUPT.

395
00:14:29,203 --> 00:14:31,371
THERE IS A MAN
THAT'S REALLY INTERESTED

396
00:14:31,455 --> 00:14:33,457
IN PAINTING NUMBER 15.

397
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:36,502
A MEETING WITH THE ARTIST
MIGHT SEAL THE DEAL.

398
00:14:36,585 --> 00:14:38,212
(WHISPERS)
I REALLY NEED THIS.
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK!

399
00:14:40,422 --> 00:14:41,757
OH, EXCUSE ME.

400
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:44,718
ARE YOU THE PERSON TO ASK
ABOUT BUYING A PAINTING?

401
00:14:46,011 --> 00:14:47,012
(SIGHS)

402
00:14:50,516 --> 00:14:51,433
(SNIFFS)

403
00:14:57,022 --> 00:14:57,940
HEY.

404
00:14:58,023 --> 00:14:59,608
UM, I'VE BEEN THINKING
ABOUT US

405
00:14:59,691 --> 00:15:00,943
AND I WANT TO GET TO KNOW
YOU BETTER.

406
00:15:01,026 --> 00:15:02,778
SO I HAVE A FEW QUESTIONS.

407
00:15:02,861 --> 00:15:03,779
SHOOT.

FAVOURITE MOVIE?

409
00:15:04,863 --> 00:15:06,031
"FAST AND THE FURIOUS V."

410
00:15:06,114 --> 00:15:07,324
WHAT'S YOUR
FAVOURITE BOOK?

411
00:15:07,407 --> 00:15:08,492
PASS.

412
00:15:08,575 --> 00:15:09,493
WHAT'S YOUR
FAVOURITE FOOD?

413
00:15:09,576 --> 00:15:10,619
HOT DOGS.
NO, PIZZA!

414
00:15:10,702 --> 00:15:12,120
HAVE YOU BEEN CHECKED
FOR STI'S?

415
00:15:12,204 --> 00:15:13,121
HUH?

416
00:15:13,205 --> 00:15:14,456
STI'S: CHLAMYDIA,
GONORRHEA...

417
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:16,375
I KNOW WHAT STI'S ARE.

418
00:15:17,376 --> 00:15:18,460
WAIT, YOU WANT
TO HAVE SEX?!

419
00:15:18,544 --> 00:15:22,297
UM... YEAH.
ONE DAY.

420
00:15:22,381 --> 00:15:24,299
SURE. YEAH.
OF COURSE I'LL GET TESTED.

421
00:15:24,383 --> 00:15:25,300
GREAT.

422
00:15:25,384 --> 00:15:26,635
UM, I'LL NEED A NOTE
FROM YOUR DOCTOR.

423
00:15:26,718 --> 00:15:28,554
COOL.
I'LL GIVE HIM A CALL!

424
00:15:28,637 --> 00:15:29,555
ALL RIGHT.

425
00:15:29,638 --> 00:15:30,556
UM, WELL, IT MIGHT TAKE
A LITTLE WHILE

426
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:31,765
FOR THE RESULTS
TO COME BACK.

427
00:15:31,849 --> 00:15:33,392
LIKE DAYS.
WEEKS, EVEN.

428
00:15:33,475 --> 00:15:35,185
YOU SEE, THIS IS WHAT
I LIKE ABOUT YOU.

429
00:15:35,269 --> 00:15:36,186
YOU'VE ALWAYS
GOT A PLAN.

430
00:15:36,270 --> 00:15:37,187
MOST GIRLS ARE WAY
TOO AFRAID

431
00:15:37,271 --> 00:15:39,147
TO EVEN TALK ABOUT SEX.

432
00:15:39,231 --> 00:15:41,400
NOPE. NOT ME.

433
00:15:42,818 --> 00:15:44,570
BETTER SAFE THAN SORRY,
RIGHT?!

I COULD NEVER HATE YOU,
ANYA.

459
00:16:54,598 --> 00:16:56,725
IT'S JUST THAT WHEN YOU
WERE ON YOUR COKE BINGE,

460
00:16:56,808 --> 00:17:00,145
YOU WERE RUINING SOMETHING
AMAZING.

461
00:17:00,229 --> 00:17:01,980
I WAS IN A DARK PLACE.

462
00:17:02,064 --> 00:17:04,107
I KNOW.

00:17:04,191 --> 00:17:06,193
I LIKE THIS ANYA -

DUDE SAID HE'D
THINK ABOUT IT

472
00:17:41,895 --> 00:17:42,813
AND THEN HE ASKED
FOR MY NUMBER.

473
00:17:42,896 --> 00:17:45,440
UGH!
THIS IS THE WORST.

474
00:17:46,650 --> 00:17:48,402
OH MY GOD!

475
00:17:48,485 --> 00:17:49,987
