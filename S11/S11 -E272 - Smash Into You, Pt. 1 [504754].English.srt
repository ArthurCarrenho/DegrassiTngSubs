00:13:32,771 --> 00:13:35,440
POSTED FOR TOMORROW'S
MODEL U.N.?

353
00:13:35,524 --> 00:13:37,484
WHERE FAMINE HAS BEEN DECLARED
IN TWO AREAS

354
00:13:37,568 --> 00:13:39,444
IN SOUTHERN SOMALIA,

355
00:13:39,528 --> 00:13:42,030
AS THIS COUNTRY SUFFERS
ITS WORST DROUGHT

356
00:13:42,114 --> 00:13:44,241
IN OVER HALF A CENTURY.

357
00:13:44,324 --> 00:13:47,911
SO I'D LOVE TO HEAR
SOME OF YOUR PROPOSAL IDEAS.

358
00:13:47,995 --> 00:13:50,789
AND WHY DON'T WE BEGIN
WITH UH...

359
00:13:50,873 --> 00:13:51,790
USA.

360
00:13:54,293 --> 00:13:56,086
MO:
WELL, AFTER LOOKING
INTO SOMALI POLITICS,

361
00:13:56,170 --> 00:13:59,131
DEMOCRACY MAY NOT NECESSARILY BE
WHAT'S BEST FOR THEM, YOU KNOW?

362
00:13:59,214 --> 00:14:00,924
AUTOCRATIC GOVERNMENTS
CAN HAVE GOOD QUALITIES,

363
00:14:01,008 --> 00:14:03,510
BUT CAN ALSO SUPPRESS
SOME BASIC LIBERTIES.

364
00:14:03,594 --> 00:14:05,470
A STRONG-HANDED GOVERNMENT
IS SOMETIMES NEEDED,

365
00:14:05,554 --> 00:14:06,847
BUT USUALLY CAUSES
MORE CORRUPTION

366
00:14:06,930 --> 00:14:08,432
THAN IT DOES LEADERSHIP.

367
00:14:08,515 --> 00:14:10,726
SO WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS?

368
00:14:10,809 --> 00:14:13,478
MARISOL:
UH, I WAS THINKING A CONCERT,

369
00:14:13,562 --> 00:14:15,105
YOU KNOW,
TO RAISE MONEY -

370
00:14:15,189 --> 00:14:18,233
COLDPLAY, BEYONCE -
AIRS ON EVERY CHANNEL.

371
00:14:18,317 --> 00:14:20,152
(CHUCKLES)

372
00:14:20,235 --> 00:14:21,570
WHAT IS SO FUNNY?

373
00:14:21,653 --> 00:14:22,779
I'M TALKING FAMINE.

374
00:14:22,863 --> 00:14:23,989
OKAY,
YOU'RE TALKING BEYONCE.

375
00:14:24,072 --> 00:14:25,324
YOU CAN'T JUST THROW MONEY
AT A PROBLEM!

376
00:14:25,407 --> 00:14:27,326
WHY NOT?
THEY'RE POOR!

377
00:14:27,409 --> 00:14:28,744
MO:
YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU'RE THE
PROBLEM WITH THE WORLD, 'KAY,

378
00:14:28,827 --> 00:14:30,370
JUDGING FROM YOUR HIGH
WESTERN HORSE,

379
00:14:30,454 --> 00:14:32,247
ALL LIKE, "OH HEY, PROBLEM,
WHAT'S UP?

380
00:14:32,331 --> 00:14:33,665
I'LL JUST THROW
SOME MONEY AT YOU."

381
00:14:33,749 --> 00:14:36,084
PERINO:
OKAY, ENOUGH, MO.

382
00:14:36,168 --> 00:14:38,754
MARISOL,
COULD YOU ELABORATE, PLEASE?

383
00:14:38,837 --> 00:14:42,341
I WAS THINKING IT COULD BE
AN INTERNATIONAL EVENT,

384
00:14:42,424 --> 00:14:43,967
BROADCAST ON EVERY CHANNEL,

385
00:14:44,051 --> 00:14:46,303
WITH STARS
AND A DONATIONS HOTLINE.

386
00:14:46,386 --> 00:14:47,304
WE CAN ALSO RAISE MONEY

387
00:14:47,387 --> 00:14:49,348
BY SELLING SONGS
FROM THE CONCERT

388
00:14:49,431 --> 00:14:50,432
ON ITUNES.

389
00:14:52,059 --> 00:14:54,561
MO, WHAT DO YOU GOT?

390
00:14:54,645 --> 00:14:56,563
I WAS GONNA HAMMER OUT
SOME IDEAS...

391
00:14:56,647 --> 00:14:58,273
TONIGHT,
WHEN I GET HOME.

392
00:15:00,067 --> 00:15:02,027
OKAY, NEXT TIME,

393
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:03,946
PLEASE DO NOT DISRESPECT
YOUR PARTNER'S IDEAS

394
00:15:04,029 --> 00:15:05,322
WHEN YOU HAVE NONE
OF YOUR OWN.

395
00:15:06,823 --> 00:15:08,909
WHO'S LAUGHING NOW?

396
00:15:28,303 --> 00:15:29,763
ADAM?

397
00:15:29,847 --> 00:15:32,558
ARE YOU SURVEILLING
THE HALLWAY?

398
00:15:32,641 --> 00:15:33,892
I FOUND ANOTHER NOTE,

399
00:15:33,976 --> 00:15:35,936
THIS TIME IN MY LOCKER.

400
00:15:38,021 --> 00:15:39,439
SOMEONE'S COMING.

401
00:15:43,026 --> 00:15:44,486
NO WAY...

402
00:15:44,570 --> 00:15:45,904
CLARE:
SHE'S REALLY PRETTY.

403
00:15:45,988 --> 00:15:47,948
ADAM:
YEAH, BUT BASED ON
SOME FACERANGE RESEARCH-

404
00:15:48,031 --> 00:15:49,074
STALKING.

405
00:15:49,157 --> 00:15:50,909
WHATEVER.

406
00:15:50,993 --> 00:15:52,369
I THINK SHE'S IN
A RELATIONSHIP

407
00:15:52,452 --> 00:15:53,871
WITH A ZIG.

408
00:15:53,954 --> 00:15:56,039
WELL, YOU SHOULD
FIND OUT FOR SURE.

409
00:15:56,123 --> 00:15:57,124
THAT'S... OKAY.

410
00:16:00,669 --> 00:16:01,670
ADAM!

411
00:16:02,754 --> 00:16:03,964
HI, UM...

412
00:16:04,047 --> 00:16:06,758
SO YOU'RE
THE NOTE-INSERTER?

413
00:16:06,842 --> 00:16:09,428
YES... NOT REALLY.

414
00:16:09,511 --> 00:16:11,889
I MEAN, I HAVE A BOYFRIEND,
OBVIOUSLY.

415
00:16:11,972 --> 00:16:14,433
THIS IS ALL...
A LOT CONFUSING.

416
00:16:14,516 --> 00:16:16,768
RIGHT. CLARITY.
UM...

417
00:16:16,852 --> 00:16:18,520
MY FRIEND HAS A CRUSH
ON YOU,

418
00:16:18,604 --> 00:16:19,521
AND I WAS KINDA WONDERING

419
00:16:19,605 --> 00:16:21,607
IF WE COULD
ALL HANG OUT TOGETHER.

420
00:16:21,690 --> 00:16:23,192
(CHUCKLES)
YOU WANT ME TO GO
ON A BLIND DATE

421
00:16:23,275 --> 00:16:24,526
WITH A BUNCH
OF GRADE NINES?

422
00:16:24,610 --> 00:16:26,445
WE'RE REALLY MATURE
FOR OUR AGE.

423
00:16:26,528 --> 00:16:28,280
I'M SURE,

424
00:16:28,363 --> 00:16:30,282
BUT DOES YOUR FRIEND
KNOW I'M-

425
00:16:30,365 --> 00:16:33,160
YES! YES.
TOTALLY KNOWS,

426
00:16:33,243 --> 00:16:36,079
HENCE THE DOUBLE
DATE OFFER.

427
00:16:37,748 --> 00:16:40,709
YOU HAVE TO SAY YES.
SAY YES?

428
00:16:41,877 --> 00:16:44,213
OKAY.
ONE DOUBLE DATE,

429
00:16:44,296 --> 00:16:45,631
NO EXPECTATIONS.

430
00:16:46,632 --> 00:16:47,799
PROMISE?

431
00:16:47,883 --> 00:16:50,344
I SWEAR ON MY EAST REGIONAL
MISS PRETEEN PAGEANT

432
00:16:50,427 --> 00:16:52,304
RUNNER-UP SASH.

433
00:16:52,387 --> 00:16:53,639
SATURDAY?

434
00:16:53,722 --> 00:16:55,516
WORKS FOR ME.

435
00:16:55,599 --> 00:16:57,976
THIS IS GONNA BE
THE BEST EVER!

436
00:16:59,561 --> 00:17:02,105
CLARE:
SO MUCH FOR NO EXPECTATIONS.

437
00:17:13,116 --> 00:17:15,244
YOU LOOK BEAUTIFUL.

438
00:17:15,327 --> 00:17:16,495
I MADE A LIST.

439
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:20,916
OH, OKAY.
WHAT KIND OF LIST?

440
00:17:22,751 --> 00:17:24,211
"TEXT OR CALL EVERY NIGHT."

441
00:17:24,294 --> 00:17:26,088
"NO HANGING OUT ALONE
WITH OTHER GIRLS,

442
00:17:26,171 --> 00:17:28,131
ESPECIALLY EX'S."

443
00:17:28,215 --> 00:17:30,342
"A HUNDRED PERCENT HONESTY
FROM BOTH OF US."

444
00:17:30,425 --> 00:17:31,510
UM...

445
00:17:31,593 --> 00:17:32,886
THERE'S MORE
ON THE BACK THERE.

446
00:17:32,970 --> 00:17:34,930
YEAH, I SEE THAT.

447
00:17:37,432 --> 00:17:38,892
WHAT'S WITH
ALL THE RULES?

448
00:17:38,976 --> 00:17:39,893
WE RUSHED BACK TOGETHER

449
00:17:39,977 --> 00:17:41,353
WITHOUT TALKING ABOUT
WHAT HAPPENED.

450
00:17:41,436 --> 00:17:44,189
I JUST, I DIDN'T KNOW
WHAT ELSE TO DO, SO...

451
00:17:44,273 --> 00:17:46,316
YOU DON'T TRUST ME?

452
00:17:47,359 --> 00:17:49,695
I LOST MY VIRGINITY
IN THE BACK OF A VAN

453
00:17:49,778 --> 00:17:51,947
PARKED IN A RAVINE
AT FOURTEEN.

454
00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:53,657
DREW CHEATED ON ME
IN THE BOILER ROOM,

455
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:55,200
AND THEN...

456
00:17:55,284 --> 00:17:58,203
AND THEN THE GUY I LOVED
AND TRUSTED THE MOST

457
00:17:58,287 --> 00:18:00,038
HAD SEX WITH A STRANGER
THIS SUMMER

458
00:18:00,122 --> 00:18:03,083
AND THEN LIED TO ME
ABOUT IT.

459
00:18:03,166 --> 00:18:06,003
SO YES,
I HAVE TRUST ISSUES.

460
00:18:07,129 --> 00:18:08,297
I'M SORRY.

461
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:09,715
I JUST WANNA FEEL SAFE

462
00:18:09,798 --> 00:18:11,717
IN WHATEVER RELATIONSHIP
I'M IN, YOU KNOW?

463
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,886
AND I KNOW THIS IS NOT
EXACTLY ROMANTIC,

464
00:18:13,969 --> 00:18:14,887
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?

465
00:18:14,970 --> 00:18:15,888
MAYBE I'M JUST NOT MEANT
FOR ROMANCE.

466
00:18:15,971 --> 00:18:18,098
ALLI! ALLI!
WAIT! WAIT! WAIT!

467
00:18:18,182 --> 00:18:19,683
(SNAPS HIS FINGERS)

468
00:18:19,766 --> 00:18:22,936
NOBODY DESERVES ROMANCE
MORE THAN YOU.

00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:25,189
(MARIACHI BAND PLAYS
A SLOW SONG)

470
00:18:26,648 --> 00:18:27,858
IF THAT'S WHAT IT TAKES
TO EARN YOUR TRUST,

471
00:18:27,941 --> 00:18:30,444
THEN I'LL ACCEPT ANY RULE
YOU THROW AT ME, ANYTIME.

472
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:31,445
REALLY?

473
00:18:31,528 --> 00:18:32,446
ALLI, THE GIRL
FROM LAST SUMMER?

474
00:18:32,529 --> 00:18:35,490
SHE'S GONE,
SHE'S OUT OF MY LIFE.

475
00:18:35,574 --> 00:18:39,036
YOU'RE THE ONLY GIRL
IN THE WORLD TO ME.

476
00:18:39,119 --> 00:18:41,496
I'VE GOT ONE RULE
FOR YOU.

477
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:42,581
WHAT?

478
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:45,501
DANCE WITH ME.

479
00:18:46,502 --> 00:18:48,921
IN LITTLE MISS STEAKS?

480
00:18:49,004 --> 00:18:51,131
WHAT?
IS THERE SOMETHING WRONG?

481
00:18:53,133 --> 00:18:54,426
NO.

482
00:18:54,510 --> 00:18:56,678
NOTHING'S WRONG.

483
00:18:56,762 --> 00:18:58,597
EVERYTHING'S PERFECT.

UGH!
IT STILL SMELLS?

ARE GONNA KISS
ON THE LIPS.

508
00:20:00,075 --> 00:20:01,702
THE FACT THAT YOU WOULD
EVEN SAY THAT

509
00:20:01,785 --> 00:20:03,161
IS SO CLUELESS!

510

CAN YOU STOP?

520
00:20:20,345 --> 00:20:21,930
THIS IS JUST...
GROSSING ME OUT.

521
00:20:22,014 --> 00:20:23,432

YOURSELF

522

TO SOME MO-MANCE.
