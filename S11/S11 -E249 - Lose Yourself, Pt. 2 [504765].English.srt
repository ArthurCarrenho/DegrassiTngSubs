TO PROTECT ELI FROM HIMSELF.

I SET OFF ONE TINY STINK
BOMB AS A DIVERSION.

334
00:15:02,528 --> 00:15:04,655
AND I DID NOT TRY
TO HAVE SEX WITH FITZ,

335
00:15:04,738 --> 00:15:07,866
NOR DID I OFFER HIM DRY CLOTHES
TO SEE HIM NAKED. BUT I DID-

336
00:15:07,950 --> 00:15:09,910
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

337
00:15:09,993 --> 00:15:13,038
ELI IS USING HIS
PULPIT TO TRASH ME,

338
00:15:13,121 --> 00:15:14,498
AND HE OBVIOUSLY WANTS
YOU TO HEAR IT,

ABOUT EVERYTHING.

00:15:22,756 --> 00:15:24,424

TO BELIEVE HIM.

I DO.

344
00:15:25,801 --> 00:15:28,762
