1
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:07,966
ADAM:
YOU'RE GONNA WAKE UP
MOM AND DAD!

2
00:00:08,050 --> 00:00:10,010
DID YOU HAVE
ANOTHER NIGHTMARE?

3
00:00:10,093 --> 00:00:11,762
THAT WOULD ONLY HAPPEN
IF I GOT TO SLEEP,

4
00:00:11,845 --> 00:00:12,846
SO NO.

5
00:00:15,807 --> 00:00:17,559
SIMPSON SHUT
THE WEIGHT ROOM DOWN

6
00:00:17,643 --> 00:00:20,270
'CAUSE KATIE WROTE SOMETHING
IN THE PAPER.

7
00:00:20,354 --> 00:00:21,271
REALLY?

8
00:00:21,355 --> 00:00:24,191
WHO WOULD TALK
TO LOIS LANE?

9
00:00:25,234 --> 00:00:27,528
WHAT, DID SHE GIVE YOU
A POLYGRAPH?

10
00:00:27,611 --> 00:00:29,780
NO, I WAS JUST AN IDIOT.

11
00:00:30,781 --> 00:00:31,782
SHE WANTED ME
TO TALK TO HER,

12
00:00:31,865 --> 00:00:33,534
AND I LIKED
TELLING HER STUFF

13
00:00:33,617 --> 00:00:36,537
'CAUSE SHE'S COOL
AND KINDA TOUGH.

14
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:38,038
PLUS, SHE'S CUTE.

15
00:00:38,121 --> 00:00:41,291
THE HONEY TRAP -
CLASSIC SPY LADY MOVE.

16
00:00:41,375 --> 00:00:43,293
YEAH, PART OF ME
WAS EVEN THINKING

17
00:00:43,377 --> 00:00:45,295
OF ASKING HER OUT.

18
00:00:45,379 --> 00:00:46,547
BUT THEN I...

19
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:47,631
UH-OH.

20
00:00:49,925 --> 00:00:51,218
I BLEW IT.

21
00:00:51,301 --> 00:00:52,219
I FLIPPED OVER
A CHAIR.

22
00:00:52,302 --> 00:00:54,513
ADAM,
I BASICALLY LOST IT.

23
00:00:55,514 --> 00:00:58,934
I CAN'T EVEN GET THROUGH A DAY
WITHOUT FLIPPING OUT, ADAM.

24
00:00:59,017 --> 00:01:02,813
SO YOU FIGURE OUT
HOW TO FIX YOURSELF FIRST.

25
00:01:02,896 --> 00:01:05,274
I DON'T KNOW
IF THAT'LL EVER HAPPEN.

26
00:01:05,357 --> 00:01:08,318
WELL, NOT IF FISTFIGHTS
ARE ALL YOU'RE TRYING.

27
00:01:08,402 --> 00:01:10,279
LOOK, IF KATIE WANTS YOU
TO OPEN UP TO HER,

28
00:01:10,362 --> 00:01:13,365
THAT'S GOTTA BE WORTH A TRY,
RIGHT?

29
00:01:15,033 --> 00:01:16,076
MAYBE YOU'RE RIGHT.

WHAT'S THIS?

48
00:02:16,428 --> 00:02:17,513
APOLOGY COFFEE.

49
00:02:17,596 --> 00:02:18,514
CAN WE PLEASE FORGET

50
00:02:18,597 --> 00:02:20,349
THAT I LOST IT ON YOU
YESTERDAY?

51
00:02:20,432 --> 00:02:22,142
THAT WASN'T ME.

52
00:02:23,519 --> 00:02:24,686
I COULD HAVE HIDDEN
THE DETAILS BETTER

53
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:25,771
IN MY ARTICLE.

54
00:02:25,854 --> 00:02:26,772
I DIDN'T MEAN
FOR SIMPSON

55
00:02:26,855 --> 00:02:28,357
TO SHUT YOU OUT OF
THE WEIGHT ROOM.

56
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:29,483
YOU WERE JUST DOING
YOUR JOB.

57
00:02:29,566 --> 00:02:30,901
AND SPEAKING OF WHICH,

58
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:33,403
I HEAR YOU NEED
A SPORTS REPORTER.

59
00:02:33,487 --> 00:02:34,488
(LAUGHS)

60
00:02:35,656 --> 00:02:36,573
YOU'RE SERIOUS?

61
00:02:36,657 --> 00:02:38,909
I'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR SOMETHING
LESS INTENSE TO DO.

62
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:40,869
MAYBE I'D BE GOOD.

63
00:02:40,953 --> 00:02:42,746
I'VE BEEN IN
YOUR ENGLISH CLASSES

64
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:43,747
AND, UM...

65
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:46,625
HEY, I CAN WRITE ABOUT STUFF
I CARE ABOUT.

66
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:47,835
IF IT MEANS
YOU'RE FORGIVING ME

67
00:02:47,918 --> 00:02:50,629
FOR ACCIDENTALLY NARC'ING
YOU OUT TO SIMPSON,

68
00:02:50,712 --> 00:02:51,922
I'LL LET YOU TRY OUT.

69
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:53,090
TRY OUT.

70
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:54,967
THAT'S GENEROUS.
(LAUGHS)

71
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:57,094
THAT'S ME,
SUPER-GENEROUS.

72
00:02:57,177 --> 00:02:58,428
THE ASSIGNMENT MEETING'S
RIGHT AFTER SCHOOL TODAY,

73
00:02:58,512 --> 00:02:59,429
OKAY?

74
00:02:59,513 --> 00:03:01,849
OKAY,
I'LL BRING MY A-GAME.

75
00:03:12,526 --> 00:03:13,777
LOOK, I'M SORRY,

76
00:03:13,861 --> 00:03:15,612
BUT I WISH YOU WOULDN'T
HAVE RUN OFF LAST NIGHT.

77
00:03:15,696 --> 00:03:16,697
WELL, ACTUALLY,
THAT WASN'T ME.

78
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:18,407
THAT WAS DAVID
WHO APPARENTLY LIKES CRICKET

79
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:19,950
AND LOOSE LEAF TEA.

80
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:21,869
I JUST WANTED MY PARENTS
TO THINK YOU WERE GREAT

81
00:03:21,952 --> 00:03:24,663
SO WE CAN SPEND
WAY MORE TIME TOGETHER.

82
00:03:24,746 --> 00:03:26,290
I THOUGHT YOU WERE HAPPY
ABOUT BEING HONEST WITH THEM.

83
00:03:26,373 --> 00:03:27,291
I AM.

84
00:03:27,374 --> 00:03:28,709
SO THEN WHY
MAKE ME LIE?

85
00:03:30,377 --> 00:03:31,962
LOOK,

86
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:32,963
IF YOU WEREN'T READY
FOR YOUR PARENTS

87
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:34,464
TO MEET YOUR BOYFRIEND,

88
00:03:34,548 --> 00:03:35,966
THAT WOULDA BEEN FINE
WITH ME.

89
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:39,344
I WOULD'VE JUST DEALT
WITH YOUR CURFEW.

90
00:03:39,428 --> 00:03:40,429
OKAY, WAIT.

91
00:03:40,512 --> 00:03:43,599
STOP,
LET'S BAAAACK IT UP HERE...

92
00:03:43,682 --> 00:03:44,808
(EXHALES)

93
00:03:44,892 --> 00:03:46,810
AND START ALL OVER AGAIN.

94
00:03:46,894 --> 00:03:49,062
DAVE TURNER,

95
00:03:49,146 --> 00:03:50,814
DO YOU WANNA MEET
MY PARENTS?

96
00:03:50,898 --> 00:03:51,982
OKAY, SORRY,
I JUST WANNA GET THIS CLEAR.

97
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:53,650
WHO EXACTLY
ARE YOU INVITING?

98
00:03:53,734 --> 00:03:54,985
ACTUAL DAVE.

99
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:57,905
COME CRACK A FEW JOKES
MY PARENTS MIGHT NOT GET.

100
00:03:57,988 --> 00:04:00,282
HECK, YOU COULD PICK THE RAISINS
OUT OF MY MOM'S BAKING,

101
00:04:00,365 --> 00:04:02,201
IF YOU WANT.

102
00:04:02,284 --> 00:04:04,203
CAN I BE YOUR BOYFRIEND
ALSO?

103
00:04:05,204 --> 00:04:08,248
I'LL TALK TO MY PARENTS
ABOUT THAT.

104
00:04:10,584 --> 00:04:11,585
(SIGHS HEAVILY)

105
00:04:12,586 --> 00:04:14,004
JULIAN:
I FOUND US ANOTHER ONE
OF THOSE CLUBS

106
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:15,005
THAT DON'T EXIST.

107
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:16,006
OWEN:
OH, GOOD!

108
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:17,674
NOW THAT PRETTY BOY GOT US
LOCKED OUT OF THE WEIGHT ROOM.

109
00:04:17,758 --> 00:04:19,009
MY COUSIN'S FRIEND HOLDS
MMA MATCHES

110
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:21,553
A COUPLE NIGHTS A WEEK.

111
00:04:21,637 --> 00:04:23,347
FOR REAL?

112
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:24,515
WAS I TALKING TO YOU?

113
00:04:24,598 --> 00:04:25,516
COME ON, GUYS,

114
00:04:25,599 --> 00:04:26,517
I'M SORRY THAT I BLABBED
TO KATIE,

115
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:30,270
BUT YOU CAN'T FREEZE ME
OUT LIKE THIS.

116
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:32,189
(SIGHS) ALL RIGHT.

117
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:34,149
I FOUND US SOME ACTION
SHE CAN'T SHUT DOWN.

118
00:04:34,233 --> 00:04:35,859
AFTER SCHOOL TODAY
WE'RE GONNA GO CHECK IT OUT.

119
00:04:35,943 --> 00:04:36,860
YOU IN?

120
00:04:36,944 --> 00:04:38,362
I CAN'T.
WHY NOT?

121
00:04:38,445 --> 00:04:39,446
I PASSED ON EVERYTHING
I'VE BEEN TAUGHT,

122
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:40,447
AND YOU'RE BETTER
THAN ME.

123
00:04:40,531 --> 00:04:42,199
YOU'RE GOOD.
IT'S NOT THAT.

124
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:44,743
IT'S JUST I'M JOINING
A DIFFERENT CLUB.

125
00:04:44,826 --> 00:04:46,662
WHAT, CHESS?
YEARBOOK?

126
00:04:46,745 --> 00:04:48,205
(BELL RINGS)

127
00:04:49,206 --> 00:04:51,208
I'LL SEND YOU THE ADDRESS
FOR WHEN YOU CHANGE YOUR MIND.

128
00:04:57,214 --> 00:04:58,382
THANKS FOR MEETING ME AGAIN.

129
00:05:02,761 --> 00:05:06,890
I SHOULDN'T HAVE AMBUSHED YOU
BY ASKING YOU FOR A KIDNEY.

130
00:05:06,974 --> 00:05:08,725
AND YOU WERE REASONABLE

131
00:05:08,809 --> 00:05:11,812
TO EXPECT SOME KIND
OF COMPENSATION.

132
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:16,567
YOU WEREN'T BEING SELFISH;
I WAS.

133
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:18,235
SO...

134
00:05:19,236 --> 00:05:20,821
I GUESS I'M JUST...

135
00:05:20,904 --> 00:05:23,866
ASKING FOR A SECOND CHANCE
AT A FIRST IMPRESSION.

136
00:05:23,949 --> 00:05:26,910
YOU DON'T NEED TO ASK
FOR A SECOND CHANCE, HOLLY J.

137
00:05:26,994 --> 00:05:30,247
ARE YOU OKAY?

138
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:31,915
I'M JUST GONNA WAIT
FOR A KIDNEY...

139
00:05:31,999 --> 00:05:34,376
LIKE LOTS OF
OTHER PEOPLE DO.

140
00:05:36,128 --> 00:05:39,423
LOOK, I JUST REALLY WANNA
STOP SAYING KIDNEY NOW.

141
00:05:39,506 --> 00:05:43,302
I WANT TO HELP YOU,
I REALLY DO.

142
00:05:43,385 --> 00:05:45,762
I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT
HOW TO FIND A WAY

143
00:05:45,846 --> 00:05:47,639
TO MAKE THE TRANSPLANT
HAPPEN.

144
00:05:47,723 --> 00:05:48,640
YOU DON'T HAVE TO,
DAWN.

145
00:05:48,724 --> 00:05:49,641
OH, I DO.

146
00:05:49,725 --> 00:05:52,019
NO, REALLY, I HAD NO RIGHT.

147
00:05:52,102 --> 00:05:55,772
THAT WAS... A STRANGE
AND SUPER INTENSE WAY

148
00:05:55,856 --> 00:05:58,692
TO MEET THE DAUGHTER
YOU GAVE UP FOR ADOPTION.

149
00:05:58,775 --> 00:06:01,320
I'VE ALWAYS WANTED
TO MEET YOU.

150
00:06:02,404 --> 00:06:06,617
I FEEL LIKE THAT'S THE SECRET
GOOD PART OF ALL OF THIS.

151
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:10,454
NOW WE CAN JUST MEET,
TALK.

152
00:06:10,537 --> 00:06:11,538
WHATEVER.

153
00:06:13,707 --> 00:06:14,875
SO, UM...

154
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:19,630
MY GRAD'S COMING UP.

155
00:06:19,713 --> 00:06:22,549
I REMEMBER MINE
LIKE IT WAS YESTERDAY.

156
00:06:22,633 --> 00:06:23,634
AND PROM?!

157
00:06:25,344 --> 00:06:26,261
THAT WAS ONE
OF THE BEST NIGHTS

158
00:06:26,345 --> 00:06:28,514
OF MY LIFE.

159
00:06:28,597 --> 00:06:30,307
MAYBE I'D BE MORE EXCITED
IF I COULD FIND A DRESS

160
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:32,434
THAT I ACTUALLY LIKED.

161
00:06:32,518 --> 00:06:33,602
I'M NOT SURE WE'RE MAKING

162
00:06:33,685 --> 00:06:35,646
THE STRONGEST CHOICE
EDITORIALLY.

163
00:06:35,729 --> 00:06:37,481
CLAIRE:
WELL, WHAT ABOUT
A SPLIT-PAGE DEBATE?

164
00:06:37,564 --> 00:06:38,982
KATIE:
THAT'S A LOT OF COLUMN WIDTH.

165
00:06:39,066 --> 00:06:40,526
CAN'T WE AFFORD
THE REAL ESTATE?

166
00:06:40,609 --> 00:06:42,152
KATIE:
WE'D HAVE TO PULL
THE SUDOKU

167
00:06:42,236 --> 00:06:43,529
AND THAT MIGHT LEAD TO MUTINY.

168
00:06:43,612 --> 00:06:45,239
IN THE STAFF ROOM, ANYWAY.
(KATIE'S VOICE FADES OUT)

169
00:06:47,282 --> 00:06:48,951
DREW:
(PANTING)
PLEASE...

170
00:06:49,034 --> 00:06:50,619
PLEASE DON'T KILL ME.

171
00:06:50,702 --> 00:06:52,955
(KICKING GRUNTS)

172
00:06:54,957 --> 00:06:55,874
(SIRENS)

173
00:06:55,958 --> 00:06:57,459
(GASPS)

174
00:06:57,543 --> 00:07:00,128
DREW? YOU OKAY?

175
00:07:00,212 --> 00:07:01,338
I'M SORRY.

176
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:03,215
I DIDN'T MEAN TO BORE YOU.

177
00:07:03,298 --> 00:07:05,676
CAN I GET SOME KIND OF
SPORTS OPINION COLUMN TOMORROW?

178
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:07,261
SORRY, I GOTTA GO.

179
00:07:13,392 --> 00:07:15,269
FIONA:
OKAY, LAST PIN...

180
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:20,190
THINK I HAVE A CAREER
AS A HUMAN MANNEQUIN?

181
00:07:20,274 --> 00:07:22,943
IT LOOKS WAY BETTER ON YOU
THAN IT DOES ON ME!

182
00:07:23,026 --> 00:07:25,445
IT'S YOURS.
I'LL GO SHOPPING.

183
00:07:27,072 --> 00:07:29,825
HEY, I THINK I MIGHT MEET UP
WITH DAWN AGAIN.

184
00:07:29,908 --> 00:07:31,326
MAYBE NEXT WEEK.

185
00:07:31,410 --> 00:07:33,537
REALLY? WELL, I KNEW
YOU COULD DO IT.

186
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:35,747
I FINALLY GET HER.
WE'RE CONNECTING.

187
00:07:35,831 --> 00:07:37,583
SO THANK YOU FOR MAKING ME TRY.

188
00:07:38,584 --> 00:07:39,543
OH, I WANTED TO SHOW
YOU SOMETHING.

189
00:07:39,626 --> 00:07:41,879
FIONA:
HOLLY J! POINTY PINS!

190
00:07:41,962 --> 00:07:42,963
(GIGGLES)

191
00:07:43,964 --> 00:07:45,716
YOU READY FOR A PROM
TIME MACHINE?

192
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:48,510
DAWN'S PROM PICTURES...

193
00:07:48,594 --> 00:07:50,012
SHE SAID IT WAS
THE BEST NIGHT OF HER LIFE,

194
00:07:50,095 --> 00:07:52,055
AND SHE STILL HAS THE DRESS.

195
00:07:52,139 --> 00:07:54,224
OH MY GOD!
THAT'S IT!

196
00:07:54,308 --> 00:07:55,225
WHAT?

197
00:07:55,309 --> 00:07:56,810
YOUR BIRTH MOM'S DRESS
IS STUNNING;

198
00:07:56,894 --> 00:07:58,478
I WANT IT.

199
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:03,609
DO YOU THINK DAWN
WOULD SELL IT TO ME?

200
00:08:03,692 --> 00:08:05,861
I DON'T KNOW,
SHE SEEMED PRETTY ATTACHED.

201
00:08:05,944 --> 00:08:06,862
I MEAN, YEAH,

202
00:08:06,945 --> 00:08:08,238
IT'S HARD TO PUT A PRICE
ON VINTAGE...

203
00:08:08,322 --> 00:08:10,282
PLUS SENTIMENTAL VALUE.

204
00:08:10,365 --> 00:08:11,825
I'D SAY...

205
00:08:11,909 --> 00:08:15,704
FI, NO...
TWENTY THOUSAND,
GIVE OR TAKE?

206
00:08:15,787 --> 00:08:18,624
I CAN COME UP
WITH THE CASH.

207
00:08:22,211 --> 00:08:23,670
UM...

208
00:08:24,671 --> 00:08:26,590
SO WHAT'D YOU GUYS
THINK OF DAVE?

209
00:08:26,673 --> 00:08:28,342
DAVE'S A VERY NICE
YOUNG MAN.

210
00:08:28,425 --> 00:08:30,677
IT'S ALWAYS NICE
TO MEET YOUR FRIENDS.

211
00:08:30,761 --> 00:08:34,348
YEAH, ABOUT THAT,
I HAVE A CONFESSION.

212
00:08:35,766 --> 00:08:38,268
DAVE ISN'T MY FRIEND.

213
00:08:39,269 --> 00:08:40,854
DAVID'S YOUR TUTOR?

214
00:08:42,397 --> 00:08:45,859
HE'S A BOY...
AND HE'S A FRIEND,

215
00:08:45,943 --> 00:08:47,945
AND IF YOU PUT THOSE
TWO WORDS TOGETHER,

216
00:08:48,028 --> 00:08:49,947
YOU GET...?

217
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:51,532
HE'S YOUR FRIEND-BOY.

218
00:08:51,615 --> 00:08:52,616
REALLY, MOM?

219
00:08:54,326 --> 00:08:57,287
YOU KNOW WE DON'T LIKE
EITHER YOU OR SAV DATING;

220
00:08:57,371 --> 00:08:59,498
IT'S A DISTRACTION.
YOU SHOULD FOCUS ON-

221
00:08:59,581 --> 00:09:01,792
SCHOOL AND GOOD FRIENDS.

222
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:04,920
BUT DAVE IS MY GOOD FRIEND
AND I'M DOING WELL IN SCHOOL,

223
00:09:05,003 --> 00:09:06,630
AND WE'RE GOOD PEOPLE.

224
00:09:06,713 --> 00:09:08,632
I STILL DO NOT LIKE
THIS IDEA.

225
00:09:08,715 --> 00:09:09,842
BUT I'M BEING HONEST!

226
00:09:09,925 --> 00:09:10,926
I'M TELLING YOU THE TRUTH

227
00:09:11,009 --> 00:09:12,803
SO I DON'T HAVE TO RUN AROUND
BEHIND YOUR BACK.

228
00:09:12,886 --> 00:09:16,557
WE'RE GLAD THAT
YOU'RE BEING HONEST WITH US.

229
00:09:22,646 --> 00:09:24,857
I GUESS IT WAS BOUND
TO HAPPEN AT SOME POINT.

230
00:09:28,694 --> 00:09:31,780
SO DOES THIS MEAN
I CAN...

231
00:09:31,864 --> 00:09:34,825
MAYBE HAVE DAVE COME OVER
AGAIN...

232
00:09:34,908 --> 00:09:36,326
AS MY FRIEND-BOY?

233
00:09:37,327 --> 00:09:38,662
(LAUGHS)

234
00:09:40,581 --> 00:09:41,582

I'M SURPRISED
YOU'RE STILL ALIVE.

00:11:42,661 --> 00:11:43,704
WELL, HERE I AM.

270
00:11:43,787 --> 00:11:45,122
SERIOUSLY, BRO?

271
00:11:45,205 --> 00:11:46,415
YOU GOT A DEATH WISH
OR SOMETHING?

272
00:11:46,498 --> 00:11:48,584
I LEFT MYSELF OPEN
FOR A CHOKE HOLD.

273
00:11:48,667 --> 00:11:50,627
STUPID, I KNOW.

274
00:11:51,712 --> 00:11:52,629
BUT I WANT TO BEAT HIM.

275
00:11:52,713 --> 00:11:53,922

00:12:03,765 --> 00:12:05,184
GET THE GIRL,

281
00:12:06,185 --> 00:12:07,978
STOP USING YOUR FISTS.

282
00:12:08,061 --> 00:12:09,479
YOU'LL GET YOURSELF KILLED.

283
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,481
FINE.

(SIGHS)

285
00:12:19,072 --> 00:12:21,241
IT'S NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN,
DAVID.

286
00:12:21,325 --> 00:12:24,912
I PREFER DAVE.
DAVID NEVER STUCK.

287
00:12:24,995 --> 00:12:26,538
OF COURSE.

288
00:12:26,622 --> 00:12:29,249
UM, WHAT ABOUT YOU, MR. B?
HOW YOU BEEN?

289
00:12:29,333 --> 00:12:32,169
IF YOU DON'T MIND,
I PREFER MR. BHANDARI.

(LAUGHS)

291
00:12:33,962 --> 00:12:36,256
(LAUGHS) OF COURSE,

292
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:37,841
ANYWAYS,
I WANT YOU GUYS TO KNOW

293
00:12:37,925 --> 00:12:40,052
THAT I REALLY CARE
ABOUT ALLI.

294
00:12:40,135 --> 00:12:41,136
SHE'S AWESOME.

295
00:12:44,515 --> 00:12:45,849
WOULD YOU LIKE
SOME TEA?

296
00:12:45,933 --> 00:12:48,185
ALLI:
UM, NOT FOR DAVE.

297
00:12:48,268 --> 00:12:51,021
YEAH,
I'M NOT A BIG TEA GUY.

298
00:12:52,022 --> 00:12:53,524
YEAH... WHEW!

299
00:12:54,525 --> 00:12:57,444
ANYWAYS, YOU GUYS WANNA PLAY
A GAME OR SOMETHING?

300
00:12:57,528 --> 00:13:01,198
AN INTELLECTUAL GAME, MAYBE,
LIKE SCRABBLE?

301
00:13:01,281 --> 00:13:02,407
OR CARDS?

302
00:13:02,491 --> 00:13:03,450
MRS. BHANDARI:
OH NO, WE DON'T-

303
00:13:03,534 --> 00:13:05,244
I DON'T THINK
WE EVEN HAVE A DECK OF...

304
00:13:05,327 --> 00:13:06,328
POKER?

305
00:13:07,412 --> 00:13:10,165
BUT YOU HAVE TO WATCH OUT,
DAVID.

306
00:13:10,249 --> 00:13:11,166
I HAVE TO WARN YOU,

307
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:12,167
MY FRIENDS AND I PLAYED
FOR HOURS

308
00:13:12,251 --> 00:13:13,877
BETWEEN CLASSES
AT UNIVERSITY.

309
00:13:13,961 --> 00:13:16,088
I TRIED TO TEACH ALLI
YEARS AGO.

310
00:13:16,171 --> 00:13:18,382
YEAH, I KNOW.
BORING!

311
00:13:18,465 --> 00:13:19,758
DAVE AND MR. BHANDARI:
HOW CAN YOU SAY THAT?

312
00:13:26,223 --> 00:13:28,308
I THOUGHT I'D SHAKE UP
OUR MEETINGS

313
00:13:28,392 --> 00:13:29,935
WITH A LITTLE
FRESH AIR.

314
00:13:30,018 --> 00:13:32,896
THANKS FOR LETTING ME BUY YOU
THE NON-DAIRY LATTE.

315
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:35,482
IT'S QUITE A TREAT,
ACTUALLY.

316
00:13:36,483 --> 00:13:37,568
OKAY, UM...

317
00:13:37,651 --> 00:13:38,569
THIS MIGHT SOUND WEIRD,

318
00:13:38,652 --> 00:13:40,779
BUT MY FRIEND FIONA
WANTS TO BUY

319
00:13:40,863 --> 00:13:41,905
YOUR PROM DRESS.

320
00:13:41,989 --> 00:13:44,032
SHE'S A NUT FOR VINTAGE.

321
00:13:44,116 --> 00:13:46,743
WELL, THAT'S SWEET,
BUT I CAN LEND IT TO HER.

322
00:13:46,827 --> 00:13:48,579
SHE INSISTS SHE COULDN'T.

323
00:13:48,662 --> 00:13:51,373
SHE SAID
IT'S EXTREMELY VALUABLE.

324
00:13:51,456 --> 00:13:53,083
WELL, IT'S NICE, BUT-

325
00:13:54,084 --> 00:13:56,170
SHE WANTS TO PAY YOU
TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS.

326
00:13:58,839 --> 00:14:01,175
THAT AMOUNT SOUNDS FAMILIAR.

327
00:14:01,258 --> 00:14:02,885
FIONA CAN'T HELP
HAVING FABULOUS

328
00:14:02,968 --> 00:14:04,720
AND EXPENSIVE TASTE IN GOWNS.

329
00:14:05,721 --> 00:14:09,683
AND THIS WON'T GET US
INTO TROUBLE?

330
00:14:11,018 --> 00:14:12,352
SHE'LL PAY CASH.

331
00:14:17,274 --> 00:14:18,275
(CLINK)

332
00:14:21,653 --> 00:14:22,654
(SIGHS)

333
00:14:24,198 --> 00:14:25,991
HEY, MR. TORRES.

334
00:14:26,074 --> 00:14:29,036
BEEN LOOKING FOR YOU
ALL DAY.

335
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:30,287
JUST TRYING TO LAY LOW.

336
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:32,289
THAT'S WHAT WRITERS DO
WHEN THEY BLOW DEADLINES.

337
00:14:32,372 --> 00:14:33,874
WHERE'S MY PIECE?

338
00:14:35,417 --> 00:14:37,753
I'M TRYING TO DO IT.

339
00:14:37,836 --> 00:14:39,129
BUT I CAN'T,
I'M SORRY.

340
00:14:39,213 --> 00:14:41,465
YOU NEED TO FIND
SOMEONE ELSE.

341
00:14:41,548 --> 00:14:44,593
SO I GUESS I'LL NEVER
FIND OUT, HUH?

342
00:14:45,594 --> 00:14:46,887
THE BIG MYSTERY?

343
00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:49,932
WHAT IS DREW TORRES
AFRAID OF?

344
00:14:50,015 --> 00:14:50,891
IS THAT FOR
YOUR NEXT ARTICLE?

345
00:14:50,974 --> 00:14:54,061
I'M NOT ASKING
AS A JOURNALIST.

346
00:14:55,187 --> 00:14:57,397
♪ Stand tall and proud ♪

347
00:14:57,481 --> 00:15:00,067
♪ You're a steep bow ♪

348
00:15:01,235 --> 00:15:05,322
(SIGHS HEAVILY)
I HAVE NIGHTMARES,

349
00:15:05,405 --> 00:15:07,991
AND THE ONLY ANSWER
IS FIGHTING.

350
00:15:08,075 --> 00:15:10,118
SO THE RUMOURS ABOUT
WHAT HAPPENED AFTER SPRING BREAK

351
00:15:10,202 --> 00:15:11,578
ARE TRUE?

352
00:15:14,373 --> 00:15:18,293
I GOT JUMPED...
BY A BUNCH OF GUYS.

353
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:24,299
KATIE, I THOUGHT
I WAS GOING TO DIE.

354
00:15:24,383 --> 00:15:25,843
WHY DIDN'T YOU
JUST SAY THAT?

355
00:15:25,926 --> 00:15:28,011
BECAUSE BEING SCARED
IS WEAK.

356
00:15:28,095 --> 00:15:30,430
EVERYBODY'S SCARED
OF SOMETHING.

357
00:15:31,682 --> 00:15:32,599
HAVE YOU EVER
THOUGHT ABOUT

358
00:15:32,683 --> 00:15:34,977
TRYING SOME OTHER FORM
OF TRAINING?

359
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:37,187
SOMETHING STRUCTURED?

360
00:15:37,271 --> 00:15:39,439
MAYBE WE COULD DO
SOMETHING TOGETHER?

361
00:15:41,191 --> 00:15:45,404

362
00:15:45,487 --> 00:15:48,323

with dignity... ♪

363
00:15:48,407 --> 00:15:49,408

364
00:15:53,453 --> 00:15:54,663
I'M SORRY,
THAT WAS WRONG.

365
00:15:54,746 --> 00:15:57,165
NO, THAT WASN'T
A STOP SIGN.

366
00:15:57,249 --> 00:15:58,876
NO, I CAN'T DO THIS
TO YOU.

367
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:00,669
I'M JUST GONNA MESS

WHEN YOU'RE SCARED,

473
00:21:00,093 --> 00:21:02,137
LEARNING TO DEFEND YOURSELF
BUILDS CONFIDENCE.

474
00:21:02,221 --> 00:21:04,056
