535
00:21:22,658 --> 00:21:24,743
NO NEED TO WORRY,
ADAM TORRES.

536
00:21:24,826 --> 00:21:27,579
ELI GOLDSWORTHY JUST
PUNCHED ME IN THE FACE!

537
00:21:27,663 --> 00:21:29,498
DON'T PROVOKE HIM,
HE'S AN ANIMAL!

538
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:37,256
I DID NOT HIT HER.

539
00:21:37,339 --> 00:21:39,007
THAT GIRL IS PSYCHO.

540
00:21:43,512 --> 00:21:44,930
YEAH.

541
00:21:45,013 --> 00:21:46,014
TOTALLY.
