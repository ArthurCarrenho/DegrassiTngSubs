00:06:59,962 --> 00:07:01,338
YOU'VE BEEN WITH ME
FOR FIVE YEARS

180
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:03,549
AND THE ENTIRE TIME
IT'S BEEN HELL.

181
00:07:03,632 --> 00:07:05,926
THE FIGHTS, NOT KNOWING
WHERE YOU ARE AT ALL HOURS,

182
00:07:06,009 --> 00:07:07,052
THE POLICE SHOWING UP
AT MY DOOR

183
00:07:07,135 --> 00:07:09,012
WITH YOU IN HANDCUFFS!

184
00:07:09,096 --> 00:07:12,766
NOW YOU'RE JUST BACK-SLIDING
INTO YOUR OLD WAYS.

185
00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:16,186
WOW, EVERYONE IS SO QUICK
TO THINK THE WORST OF ME.

186
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:20,524
I JUST NEED SOMEONE
TO BELIEVE THAT I CAN CHANGE.

187
00:07:20,607 --> 00:07:22,985
ONE PERSON,
THAT'S ALL!

188
00:07:25,028 --> 00:07:26,196
(SCOFFS)

189
00:07:28,699 --> 00:07:30,617
(ITEMS IN FRIDGE CLINK)

190
00:07:30,701 --> 00:07:31,952
(TRUCK RUMBLES)

191
00:07:34,496 --> 00:07:36,707
COULD THIS PLACE BE MORE
IN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE?

192
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:37,708
SORRY I'M LATE.

193
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:39,293
NAH, YOU'RE JUST IN TIME
TO START TAPING.

194
00:07:39,376 --> 00:07:40,377
HERE.

195
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:42,838
(FLATLY)
WOO-HOO.

196
00:07:42,921 --> 00:07:44,923
JAKE:
UH-OH! WHAT'S WRONG?

197
00:07:45,924 --> 00:07:47,551
MY DATE WITH MARISOL'S OFF.

198
00:07:47,634 --> 00:07:50,137
AW, MAN.
WHAT DID YOU DO?

199
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:51,471
OTHER THAN FAIL
TO TRANSFORM

200
00:07:51,555 --> 00:07:53,140
INTO THE KIND OF GUY
SHE WOULDN'T DUMP?

201
00:07:53,223 --> 00:07:54,683
JAKE:
SORRY, BUD.

202
00:07:54,766 --> 00:07:57,644
SO ARE YOU STILL GONNA
HELP ME PAINT OR...?

203
00:07:57,728 --> 00:07:59,479
MIGHT AS WELL MAKE
A FEW BUCKS,

204
00:07:59,563 --> 00:08:01,023
PICK UP DINNER FOR ONE
ON THE WAY HOME.

205
00:08:01,106 --> 00:08:02,107
JAKE:
THAT'S THE SPIRIT!

206
00:08:02,191 --> 00:08:04,234
LOOK, I'M NOT PAINTING THIS
WHOLE PLACE BLACK BY MYSELF.

207
00:08:04,318 --> 00:08:07,196
MO:
WAIT. WHY DOES IT ALL
HAVE TO BE PAINTED BLACK?

208
00:08:12,117 --> 00:08:14,119
(LOW HUM OF CHATTER)

209
00:08:18,957 --> 00:08:20,125
DUDE, DUDE, DUDE, DUDE!

210
00:08:20,209 --> 00:08:21,210
JAKE:
YEAH?

211
00:08:24,004 --> 00:08:26,173
CHECK OUT THOSE GIRLS.

212
00:08:26,256 --> 00:08:28,342
THEY LOOK LIKE STRIPPERS.

213
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:32,971
MO AND JAKE:
THEY ARE STRIPPERS!

214
00:08:33,972 --> 00:08:34,890
GIRLS:
HEY!

215
00:08:34,973 --> 00:08:35,974
HI.

216
00:08:39,394 --> 00:08:40,395
(KNOCKING)

217
00:08:42,356 --> 00:08:43,357
AUDRA:
HEY.

218
00:08:44,650 --> 00:08:46,109
WE HAVE A FRONT DOOR,
YOU KNOW.

219
00:08:46,193 --> 00:08:47,778
SORRY. HABIT.

220
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:51,532
THE GUYS ARE OUT
PICKING UP DINNER.

221
00:08:51,615 --> 00:08:53,283
THAT'S FINE.

222
00:08:53,367 --> 00:08:55,619
I CAME TO SEE YOU.

223
00:08:55,702 --> 00:08:57,704
OH! EVERYTHING OKAY?

224
00:08:58,956 --> 00:09:01,542
I WANTED TO OFFICIALLY
THANK YOU

225
00:09:01,625 --> 00:09:02,543
FOR HELPING ME

226
00:09:02,626 --> 00:09:05,003
AFTER EVERYTHING
THAT HAPPENED AT PROM,

227
00:09:05,087 --> 00:09:09,383
GIVING ME A SUMMER JOB,
AND PAYING FOR MY LAWYERS.

228
00:09:09,466 --> 00:09:11,176
IT'LL TAKE ME A WHILE
TO COME UP WITH THE MONEY,

229
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:15,264
BUT I'M GONNA HAVE THIS
BRACELET MADE FOR YOU.

230
00:09:21,061 --> 00:09:22,813
BIANCA...

231
00:09:22,896 --> 00:09:24,982
YOU HELPED ME OUT
OF A DARK PLACE,

232
00:09:25,065 --> 00:09:31,238
AND I HATE THAT I CAN NEVER
FULLY REPAY YOU FOR THAT.

233
00:09:32,239 --> 00:09:33,949
BUT I CAN STAY AWAY
FROM YOUR FAMILY FROM NOW ON,

234
00:09:34,032 --> 00:09:36,285
SO THAT'S WHAT
I'M GONNA DO.

235
00:09:36,368 --> 00:09:37,703
WHAT? WHY?

236
00:09:41,081 --> 00:09:42,416
I JUST DON'T WANT
ANY OF YOU

237
00:09:42,499 --> 00:09:45,043
TO GET HURT AGAIN
BECAUSE OF ME.

238
00:09:45,127 --> 00:09:47,254
BUT BEFORE I DISAPPEAR,

239
00:09:47,337 --> 00:09:51,508
I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW
HOW AWESOME YOU ARE.

240
00:09:51,592 --> 00:09:52,843
NOBODY IN THE WORLD
HAD MORE REASONS

241
00:09:52,926 --> 00:09:55,637
NOT TO BELIEVE IN ME,
BUT...

242
00:09:55,721 --> 00:09:57,389
YOU STILL DID.

243
00:09:59,349 --> 00:10:01,018
WELL, I UH...

244
00:10:01,101 --> 00:10:04,521
CERTAINLY CAN'T TELL YOU
WHAT TO DO,

245
00:10:04,605 --> 00:10:08,525
BUT I DON'T THINK
YOU SHOULD DISAPPEAR.

246
00:10:08,609 --> 00:10:09,610
COME HERE.

247
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:18,285
MY AUNTIE SUCKS.

248
00:10:19,286 --> 00:10:20,746
I'M FINALLY GETTING
GOOD GRADES

249
00:10:20,829 --> 00:10:23,081
AND SHE WON'T EVEN GO
TO MY TEACHER INTERVIEWS.

250
00:10:23,165 --> 00:10:24,958
WHY NOT?

251
00:10:25,042 --> 00:10:27,336
SHE'S GIVEN UP ON ME.

252
00:10:29,171 --> 00:10:30,464
WELL, IF YOU WANT,

253
00:10:30,547 --> 00:10:33,383
I CAN GO TO YOUR TEACHER
INTERVIEW WITH YOU.

254
00:10:36,428 --> 00:10:37,888
AFTER ALL THE CRAP

255
00:10:37,971 --> 00:10:40,641
I'VE PUT DREW
AND ADAM THROUGH,

256
00:10:40,724 --> 00:10:43,852
WHY ARE YOU BEING
SO NICE TO ME?

257
00:10:43,936 --> 00:10:45,896
THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION.

258
00:10:46,897 --> 00:10:48,649
YOU KNOW, THIS MAY COME
AS A SHOCK TO YOU,

259
00:10:48,732 --> 00:10:52,236
BUT I WASN'T ALWAYS
THIS PERFECT,

260
00:10:52,319 --> 00:10:55,197
ESPECIALLY WHEN
I WAS YOUR AGE.

261
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:57,241
BUT I HAD HELP
AND I CHANGED

262
00:10:57,324 --> 00:10:59,409
AND MADE SOMETHING
OF MYSELF.

263
00:10:59,493 --> 00:11:00,911
AND YOU CAN TOO.

264
00:11:00,994 --> 00:11:04,790
IT'S PRETTY OBVIOUS
YOU'RE ALREADY TRYING.

265
00:11:04,873 --> 00:11:07,960
GUY:
THANKS, GUYS!
UP NEXT, AZIZ!

266
00:11:08,043 --> 00:11:09,253
(AUDIENCE CLAPS)

267
00:11:10,254 --> 00:11:11,797
AZIZ:
ALL RIGHT! THANK YOU!
THANK YOU VERY MUCH!

268
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:12,881
MY NAME IS AZIZ.

269
00:11:12,965 --> 00:11:15,717
THANK YOU FOR
THE TEPID APPLAUSE.

270
00:11:15,801 --> 00:11:17,219
YEAH,
MAKES ME FEEL GOOD.

271
00:11:17,302 --> 00:11:18,554
UH, I KNOW YOU CAN'T TELL
BY LOOKING AT ME,

272
00:11:18,637 --> 00:11:20,305
BUT I DON'T DATE A LOT.

273
00:11:20,389 --> 00:11:23,141
AND BY A LOT,
I MEAN, UM, NEVER.

274
00:11:23,225 --> 00:11:24,560
I JUST- I NEVER DATE.

275
00:11:25,561 --> 00:11:27,646
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

276
00:11:28,522 --> 00:11:29,857
I THOUGHT
WE WERE IGNORING

277
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:31,942
THE ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM,
REMEMBER?!

278
00:11:32,025 --> 00:11:33,026
LOOK, I KNOW.
I KNOW, I'M SORRY.

279
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:34,278
IT'S JUST...

280
00:11:34,361 --> 00:11:37,656
THE THINGS HER FRIENDS
ARE POSTING ABOUT ME...

281
00:11:37,739 --> 00:11:39,825
GIVE ME YOUR PHONE.

282
00:11:39,908 --> 00:11:42,327
GIVE ME YOUR PHONE!

283
00:11:42,411 --> 00:11:43,787
DAVE: (LOUDLY)
LOOK, I CAN'T PRETEND
WHAT HAPPENED DIDN'T HAPPEN.

284
00:11:43,871 --> 00:11:45,539
IT'S NEVER GONNA GO AWAY!

285
00:11:45,622 --> 00:11:48,709
AZIZ:
JEEZ, DUDE! DUDE!
JUST GIVE HER YOUR PHONE!

286
00:11:48,792 --> 00:11:51,378
ALLI:

UM... SORRY.

287
00:11:51,461 --> 00:11:52,838
AZIZ:
SWEETIE, YOU DON'T NEED
TO APOLOGIZE;

288
00:11:52,921 --> 00:11:54,089
YOUR BOYFRIEND
SHOULD THOUGH -

289
00:11:54,173 --> 00:11:55,340
TO ME FOR INTERRUPTING

290
00:11:55,424 --> 00:11:57,176
AND TO YOU
FOR BEING A JERK.

291
00:11:57,259 --> 00:11:59,428
DAVE:
OKAY, YOU MADE YOUR POINT.

292
00:11:59,511 --> 00:12:01,013
AZIZ:
HOW COULD YOU GO OUT
WITH A FINE GIRL LIKE THAT

293
00:12:01,096 --> 00:12:03,807
AND SPEND THE ENTIRE TIME
JUST STARING AT YOUR PHONE?

294
00:12:03,891 --> 00:12:04,975
HE'S JUST JOKING.

295
00:12:05,058 --> 00:12:06,185
AZIZ:
PEOPLE OF THE WORLD,

296
00:12:06,268 --> 00:12:07,603
YOUR CELL PHONE IS GONNA
RUIN YOUR LIFE.

297
00:12:07,686 --> 00:12:08,687
CASE IN POINT
RIGHT THERE!

298
00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:10,397
DAVE:
OKAY, WHAT! ARE YOU DOING
ANY MORE JOKES OR NO?!

299
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,398
WHAT?! WHAT?!

300
00:12:11,481 --> 00:12:12,399
AZIZ:
HEY, SWEETIE, SWEETIE!

301
00:12:12,482 --> 00:12:13,400
IF YOU LET ME
TAKE YOU OUT,

302
00:12:13,483 --> 00:12:15,027
I PROMISE I WON'T LET A PHONE
COME BETWEEN US.

303
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:16,111
DAVE:
LOOK! THAT'S IT!

304
00:12:16,195 --> 00:12:18,155
OOH! OOH! HEY!
NOW YOU'RE GETTING PROTECTIVE?!

305
00:12:18,238 --> 00:12:19,156
SHUT THE HELL UP!

306
00:12:19,239 --> 00:12:20,157
PLEASE DON'T.

307
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,158
STICK A FORK IN IT,

308
00:12:21,241 --> 00:12:24,244
I THINK THAT RELATIONSHIP
IS DONE...LIKE DINNER.

309
00:12:29,958 --> 00:12:30,959
(HUFFS)

310
00:12:33,295 --> 00:12:35,714
IS IT COLD IN HERE
OR IS IT JUST ME?

311
00:12:35,797 --> 00:12:37,883
BELLA:
SO LET ME GUESS,

312
00:12:37,966 --> 00:12:40,427
YOU ARE A FOOTBALL PLAYER?

313
00:12:40,511 --> 00:12:41,762
MO:
YEAH, I LIKE FOOTBALL,
DON'T GET ME WRONG,

314
00:12:41,845 --> 00:12:44,223
BUT THE TOUGHEST GUYS WRESTLE,
YOU KNOW?

315
00:12:44,306 --> 00:12:45,682
NO PADS OR HELMETS.

316
00:12:46,683 --> 00:12:48,018
JUST YOU AND DESTINY.

317
00:12:48,101 --> 00:12:50,062
DESTINY'S SHIFT
DOESN'T START UNTIL ELEVEN.

318
00:12:50,145 --> 00:12:52,064
(CHUCKLES)
HAH! GOOD ONE.

319
00:12:52,147 --> 00:12:54,775
HEY, MO,
WE GOTTA FINISH UP.

320
00:12:54,858 --> 00:12:55,692
THE MANAGER WANTS US
OUT OF HERE

321
00:12:55,776 --> 00:12:57,486
BEFORE THEY OPEN TONIGHT.

322
00:12:57,569 --> 00:12:59,029
JUST TRYING TO BE
A GENTLEMAN, BRO.

323
00:12:59,112 --> 00:12:59,655
WHAT'S THE RUSH?

324
00:12:59,738 --> 00:13:02,074

SMALL REQUEST.

327
00:13:07,454 --> 00:13:08,372
JAKE:
WHAT?

328
00:13:08,455 --> 00:13:09,748
TAKE A COUPLE OF PICTURES
OF ME AND THE HOT GIRLS?

329
00:13:09,831 --> 00:13:10,749
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

330
00:13:10,832 --> 00:13:12,709
PLEASE!
FINE!

331
00:13:12,793 --> 00:13:15,712
THIS IS A TERRIBLE IDEA.

(CAMERA SNAPS)

335
00:13:27,015 --> 00:13:28,225
YOU'VE HAD YOUR FUN.

336
00:13:28,308 --> 00:13:29,309
NOT YET.

337
00:13:31,061 --> 00:13:32,062
AND...TWEETED.

338
00:13:33,438 --> 00:13:34,982
NOW I'VE HAD MY FUN.

339
00:13:35,065 --> 00:13:36,733
MARISOL'S GONNA SEE THAT,
YOU KNOW.

340
00:13:36,817 --> 00:13:38,110
OH, REALLY?

341
00:13:38,193 --> 00:13:39,778
SHE'S GONNA SEE ME HANGING OUT
WITH THESE HOT LADIES

342
00:13:39,862 --> 00:13:41,780
AND REALIZE
WHAT SHE'S MISSED?

343
00:13:41,864 --> 00:13:43,115
I HOPE SHE DOESN'T
GET JEALOUS

344
00:13:43,198 --> 00:13:45,075
AND COME RUNNING BACK,
RIGHT?

345
00:13:45,158 --> 00:13:48,036
WOW. YOU REALLY
DON'T GET GIRLS.

352
00:14:07,055 --> 00:14:08,056
MY PARENTS ARE TAKING ME
OUT OF SCHOOL

353
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:09,892
AND SENDING ME TO REHAB.

354
00:14:10,893 --> 00:14:11,894
WOW.

355
00:14:13,145 --> 00:14:14,313
YOU KNOW, MY PARENTS
ARE GOING OVERBOARD.

356
00:14:14,396 --> 00:14:15,480
I DON'T NEED ALL THIS.

357
00:14:15,564 --> 00:14:16,481
YOU OD'D.

358
00:14:16,565 --> 00:14:17,566
I'M FINE.

359
00:14:17,649 --> 00:14:22,738
YEAH, ONLY BECAUSE BIANCA
MADE SURE YOU GOT HOME SAFE!

360
00:14:22,821 --> 00:14:24,114
KATIE:
I KNOW.

361
00:14:25,115 --> 00:14:27,326
LOOK, THIS PROBABLY DOESN'T
MEAN MUCH, BUT...

362
00:14:27,409 --> 00:14:28,660
BEFORE I MESSED
EVERYTHING UP,

363
00:14:28,744 --> 00:14:30,078
I WAS ACTUALLY HAVING FUN.

364
00:14:31,455 --> 00:14:32,789
SAME HERE.

365
00:14:38,086 --> 00:14:40,172
OH MY GOD...
(CRYING)

366
00:14:40,255 --> 00:14:43,634
I'M GOING...
I'M GOING TO REHAB.

367
00:14:43,717 --> 00:14:44,843
I'M THE SCHOOL PRESIDENT.

368
00:14:44,927 --> 00:14:46,887
THIS WAS SUPPOSED
TO BE MY YEAR.

369
00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:48,722
THIS IS SO HUMILIATING.

370
00:14:49,723 --> 00:14:50,933
(SOBBING)

371
00:14:55,938 --> 00:14:58,815
YOU'LL GET THROUGH THIS,
KATIE.

372
00:14:58,899 --> 00:15:02,528
YOU HAVE A GREAT FAMILY
AND FRIENDS WHO LOVE YOU.

373
00:15:02,611 --> 00:15:05,697
THEY'RE ALL GONNA
SUPPORT YOU.

374
00:15:08,617 --> 00:15:10,619
AND YOU HAVE DREW.

375
00:15:13,038 --> 00:15:16,041
HE'S GONNA BE THERE
FOR YOU, TOO.

376
00:15:17,793 --> 00:15:20,045
YEAH... I KNOW.

377
00:15:21,129 --> 00:15:23,966
THE BEST BOYFRIEND
IN THE WORLD.

378
00:15:24,967 --> 00:15:26,468
(KATIE SOBS)

379
00:15:40,148 --> 00:15:42,401
(SIGHS) OH NO,
HAVE YOU BEEN CRYING?

380
00:15:42,484 --> 00:15:43,986
ONLY ALL NIGHT.

381
00:15:44,987 --> 00:15:47,573
I THOUGHT YOU'D GET MAD,
NOT CRY!

382
00:15:47,656 --> 00:15:49,074
HUH?

383
00:15:49,157 --> 00:15:50,576
OKAY, I KNOW I OVERREACTED,
ALL RIGHT?

384
00:15:50,659 --> 00:15:52,661
BUT I PLANNED
THIS AMAZING DATE

385
00:15:52,744 --> 00:15:54,413
AND YOU BAILED
AND IT HURT REALLY BAD-

386
00:15:54,496 --> 00:15:55,414
MO...

387
00:15:55,497 --> 00:15:57,958
I KNOW A NORMAL GUY WOULD'VE
TRIED TO TALK TO YOU,

388
00:15:58,041 --> 00:15:59,835
INSTEAD OF POSTING
THOSE STUPID PICTURES

389
00:15:59,918 --> 00:16:01,003
ON TWITTER.

390
00:16:01,086 --> 00:16:02,004
BUT DESPITE
WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE,

391
00:16:02,087 --> 00:16:03,088
I, 100 PERCENT,

392
00:16:03,172 --> 00:16:05,007
DID NOT HOOK UP
WITH TWO STRIPPERS.

393
00:16:05,090 --> 00:16:06,341
WHAT?!

394
00:16:06,425 --> 00:16:09,595
YOU DIDN'T SEE THOSE PICS?
CRAP.

395
00:16:09,678 --> 00:16:12,431
NO, I DIDN'T SEE ANY PICS OF YOU
WITH ANY STRIPPERS.

396
00:16:12,514 --> 00:16:14,725
I DON'T EVEN FOLLOW YOU
ON TWITTER!

397
00:16:14,808 --> 00:16:16,143
THEN WHY ARE YOU CRYING?

398
00:16:16,226 --> 00:16:19,438
BECAUSE MY LIFE HAS BEEN
A TOTAL HELL THE LAST FEW DAYS.

399
00:16:19,521 --> 00:16:22,524
MY BEST FRIEND IS GOING THROUGH
A MAJOR LIFE CRISIS

400
00:16:22,608 --> 00:16:25,652
AND I PROMISED HER
I WOULDN'T TELL ANYONE.

401
00:16:25,736 --> 00:16:27,946
OH, AND I JUST FOUND OUT
THAT THE GUY I LIKE

402
00:16:28,030 --> 00:16:30,532
IS A SELF-ABSORBED,
STRIPPER-LOVING TURD!

403
00:16:30,616 --> 00:16:32,367
WAIT!
I DON'T LOVE STRIPPERS!

404
00:16:32,451 --> 00:16:33,869
(BELL RINGS)

405
00:16:42,586 --> 00:16:43,587
HEY.

406
00:16:45,172 --> 00:16:46,465
WHAT JACINTA'S FRIENDS
SAID ABOUT ME IS TRUE.

407
00:16:46,548 --> 00:16:47,758
I'M A BAD GUY.

408
00:16:47,841 --> 00:16:50,302
BAD GUYS DON'T FEEL GUILTY
ABOUT THE MISTAKES THEY MAKE.

409
00:16:50,385 --> 00:16:51,428
YOU'RE TORTURING YOURSELF.

410
00:16:51,512 --> 00:16:53,096
THAT ONLY PROVES
YOU'RE NOT A BAD GUY!

411
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:55,224
WELL, YOU DESERVE
BETTER THAN ME.

412
00:16:55,307 --> 00:16:56,308
DON'T SAY IT.

413
00:16:56,391 --> 00:16:57,309
IF YOU WANT
TO BREAK UP...

414
00:16:57,392 --> 00:16:58,977
DO YOU WANT TO BREAK UP?

415
00:16:59,061 --> 00:17:01,480
NO, I-I DON'T.
BUT...

416
00:17:01,563 --> 00:17:02,814
EVERYONE KEEPS SAYING

417
00:17:02,898 --> 00:17:04,483
THE ONLY THING
THAT'LL MAKE THIS BETTER

418
00:17:04,566 --> 00:17:05,943
IS TIME...

419
00:17:06,026 --> 00:17:08,028
AND MAYBE SPACE.

420
00:17:08,111 --> 00:17:11,949
AND IF THAT'S TRUE,
THEN WE SHOULD BREAK UP.

421
00:17:14,076 --> 00:17:17,246
ONLY CAN WE JUST...
NOT DO THAT?

422
00:17:19,665 --> 00:17:23,627
CAN WE KEEP HAVING DRAMATIC,
YET MEMORABLE DATES?

423
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:26,004
ALLI, I DON'T KNOW WHEN
I'M GONNA GET OVER THIS.

424
00:17:27,214 --> 00:17:29,174
ME NEITHER.

425
00:17:29,258 --> 00:17:32,261
BUT I WANNA BE BESIDE YOU
WHEN THAT DAY COMES.

426
00:17:34,388 --> 00:17:36,723

455
00:19:15,072 --> 00:19:18,867
YOUR TURD-AVOIDING SKILLS
ARE SOLID.

456
00:19:18,951 --> 00:19:20,911
I HAVE TO STUDY.

00:19:36,343 --> 00:19:37,845
I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHY
YOU LIKE ME, OKAY?

464
00:19:37,928 --> 00:19:39,972

00:19:40,055 --> 00:19:41,181
