MR. TORRES, I'M CONDUCTING
A LITTLE EXPERIMENT.

7
00:00:16,183 --> 00:00:17,976
I NEED TO SEE IF I CAN FUNCTION
WITHOUT TAKING THESE.

8
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:19,186
I HAVEN'T TAKEN THESE
SINCE YESTERDAY.

9
00:00:19,269 --> 00:00:21,146
I BELIEVE THEY'RE RESPONSIBLE
FOR KILLING MY CREATIVITY -

10
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:23,649
WHICH IS GREAT WHEN
YOU'RE WRITING A PLAY.

11
00:00:23,732 --> 00:00:25,609
COME ON, I'M ON-AIR
IN FIVE MINUTES.

12
00:00:25,692 --> 00:00:26,777
PLEASE!

13
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:29,279
JUST TAKE THESE.
JUST FOR TODAY.

14
00:00:29,363 --> 00:00:30,322
IF THE PILLS AREN'T
WORKING FOR YOU,

15
00:00:30,405 --> 00:00:31,615
THEN TALK TO YOUR DOCTOR.

16
00:00:31,698 --> 00:00:32,282
WHO ARE YOU, MY DAD?

17
00:00:32,366 --> 00:00:34,368
MY UNCLE HAD TO TRY A FEW
DIFFERENT MEDICATIONS

18
00:00:34,451 --> 00:00:35,661
BEFORE HE FOUND ONE
THAT WAS RIGHT FOR HIM.

19
00:00:35,744 --> 00:00:37,454
A FEW MEDICATIONS?

20
00:00:37,538 --> 00:00:39,248
I'M NOT A LAB RAT.

21
00:00:39,331 --> 00:00:40,374
THE LAST COUPLE DAYS
HAVE BEEN A LIVING HELL.

22
00:00:40,457 --> 00:00:41,458
YOU WANT ME TO DO THAT
OVER AND OVER AGAIN

23
00:00:41,542 --> 00:00:44,169
UNTIL SOME QUACK
GETS IT RIGHT?

24
00:00:44,253 --> 00:00:45,254
WELL, OBVIOUSLY NOT, BUT-

25
00:00:45,337 --> 00:00:47,506
ARE YOU GOING TO HELP ME
OR NOT?

26
00:00:53,011 --> 00:00:54,346
SORRY, IT'S SHOW TIME.

27
00:00:56,849 --> 00:00:58,225

ABOUT THAT TEXT
YOU SAW ON MY PHONE-

44
00:01:57,618 --> 00:01:59,286
YOU'RE BEING
TOTALLY RIDICULOUS.

45
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:01,705
YOU WERE CHEATING AND
I'M BEING RIDICULOUS. RIGHT.

46
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:03,040
LET ME EXPLAIN -

47
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:05,417
THAT DATE I WENT ON,

48
00:02:05,501 --> 00:02:08,003
IT WAS WITH A GIRL,
NOT A GUY.

49
00:02:08,086 --> 00:02:09,379
THAT MAKES ME FEEL
MUCH BETTER.

50
00:02:09,463 --> 00:02:10,589
MY MOM TRICKED ME
INTO A SET-UP

51
00:02:10,672 --> 00:02:12,716
WITH ONE OF HER
FRIENDS' DAUGHTERS.

52
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:15,219
SOUNDS LIKE THIS DAUGHTER
HAD A GOOD TIME.

53
00:02:15,302 --> 00:02:18,555
IS THIS WHY YOU AND MOM
ARE BACK ON SPEAKING TERMS?

54
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:21,975
BECAUSE YOU'RE PLAYING INTO
HER HETERO FANTASIES?

55
00:02:22,059 --> 00:02:24,561
THINGS ARE GOOD
WITH MY PARENTS.

56
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:27,689
WHATEVER KEEPS THEM HAPPY.

57
00:02:27,773 --> 00:02:30,776
SEE,
I KNEW YOU'D CATCH ON.

58
00:02:30,859 --> 00:02:33,403
EVEN IF THEY DON'T
ACCEPT YOU, RILEY?

59
00:02:33,487 --> 00:02:35,364
WELL, I'M HOPE SOME DAY
THEY WILL.

60
00:02:35,447 --> 00:02:36,615
BUT UNTIL I LEAVE
FOR COLLEGE,

61
00:02:36,698 --> 00:02:38,742
I JUST WANT THINGS
BACK TO NORMAL.

62
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:40,410
WHY CAN'T YOU ACCEPT THAT?

63
00:02:40,494 --> 00:02:42,329
RILEY,
YOU'VE MET MY FAMILY,

64
00:02:44,623 --> 00:02:46,500
YOU'RE PART
OF MY WHOLE LIFE,

65
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:49,336
BUT I FEEL LIKE
A DIRTY SECRET.

66
00:02:51,505 --> 00:02:54,675
THEN SAY YOU'LL COME TO MY
BIRTHDAY DINNER TONIGHT -

67
00:02:54,758 --> 00:02:56,885
(LAUGHS)
WITH MY PARENTS.

68
00:02:56,969 --> 00:02:58,262
BUT JUST AS FRIENDS?

69
00:02:58,345 --> 00:02:59,304
BETTER THAN NOTHING,
RIGHT?

70
00:02:59,388 --> 00:03:00,889
(BELL RINGS)

71
00:03:02,474 --> 00:03:03,892
MS. DAWES:
AND, GENTLEPEOPLE,

72
00:03:03,976 --> 00:03:06,103
THE PROPOSAL DEADLINE
FOR DEPARTMENT HEADS

73
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:07,437
IS FAST APPROACHING.

74
00:03:07,521 --> 00:03:10,607
ASSUMING WE HAVE A PLAY
TO STAGE!

75
00:03:10,691 --> 00:03:11,692
GOOD!

76
00:03:14,236 --> 00:03:16,280
SO, WHAT'S THE NEW CONCEPT?

77
00:03:16,363 --> 00:03:18,282
WE NEED A SCRIPT,
LIKE, YESTERDAY.

78
00:03:18,365 --> 00:03:20,284
VERY SOON.
JUST A FEW TWEAKS.

79
00:03:20,367 --> 00:03:22,202
I KNEW
I COULD COUNT ON YOU.

80
00:03:23,996 --> 00:03:25,163
HOW'S IT COMING?

81
00:03:26,164 --> 00:03:27,082
IT'S GREAT!

82
00:03:27,165 --> 00:03:28,041
I'M TRYING A NEW APPROACH.

83
00:03:28,125 --> 00:03:29,585
MS. DAWES:
VERY GOOD!
HAVE YOU FOUND SOMEONE

84
00:03:29,668 --> 00:03:31,044
TO BOUNCE IDEAS OFF OF?

85
00:03:31,128 --> 00:03:32,796
JUST CALL ME RUBBER...

86
00:03:34,631 --> 00:03:36,633
TO BOUNCE THINGS OFF OF.

87
00:03:38,177 --> 00:03:39,094
IDEAS.

88
00:03:39,178 --> 00:03:42,222
OH, (LAUGHS)
JUST HAVE FUN WITH IT, ELI.

89
00:03:44,641 --> 00:03:47,561
YOU STILL GOT
THOSE PILLS?

90
00:03:47,644 --> 00:03:48,645
GOOD.

91
00:03:51,106 --> 00:03:52,316
HEY, DISH PIG.

92
00:03:52,399 --> 00:03:55,319
LOOKING FORWARD TO ANOTHER
FUN NIGHT AT WORK?

93
00:03:55,402 --> 00:03:56,320
ALWAYS.

94
00:03:56,403 --> 00:03:57,654
OH,
TONIGHT'S HAWAIIAN NIGHT.

95
00:03:57,738 --> 00:03:59,406
EVERYBODY'S GETTING LEI'D!

96
00:04:00,407 --> 00:04:01,533
(LAUGHS) LEIS-

97
00:04:02,993 --> 00:04:05,495
LIKE THE FLOWER NECKLACE.

98
00:04:05,579 --> 00:04:07,623
I CAN'T BELIEVE
I JUST SAID THAT.

99
00:04:07,706 --> 00:04:08,707
(LAUGHS)

100
00:04:12,044 --> 00:04:14,963
(LAUGHS)
HEY, IS LITTLE MISS
STEAKS HIRING?

101
00:04:16,423 --> 00:04:17,716
WHAT?

102
00:04:17,799 --> 00:04:19,968
HEY, I'M JUST SAYING, I COULD
USE A GOOD HAWAIIAN NECKLACE.

103
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:22,262
(LAUGHS)

104
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:25,682
MAYBE WE SHOULD GET FLASH
CARDS TO INSPIRE YOU

105
00:04:25,766 --> 00:04:28,393
OR, WE COULD DO SOME
WORD ASSOCIATION.

106
00:04:28,477 --> 00:04:29,686
FORGET IT!

107
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:30,687
IT'S IS A BAD IDEA.
I NEED THOSE PILLS.

108
00:04:30,771 --> 00:04:31,688
GIVE ME THOSE PILLS.

109
00:04:31,772 --> 00:04:33,524
ELI, BE STRONG!

110
00:04:34,942 --> 00:04:37,069
I'M FALLING APART HERE.

111
00:04:37,152 --> 00:04:40,239
IT'LL BE OKAY.
HOW DO YOU FEEL?

112
00:04:43,408 --> 00:04:45,786
PANICKY. SWEATY. SHAKY.

113
00:04:47,746 --> 00:04:49,373
IF I'M GONNA STAY
AT THIS SCHOOL, I...

114
00:04:49,456 --> 00:04:51,708
I NEED THOSE PILLS!

115
00:04:51,792 --> 00:04:54,336
THEN WHY STAY?
LET'S SKIP!

116
00:04:55,838 --> 00:04:57,506
DO YOU WANT ME
TO HELP YOU OR NOT?

117
00:05:01,051 --> 00:05:01,468
OKAY.

118
00:05:03,804 --> 00:05:04,805
WHERE TO?

119
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:13,230
HEY.

120
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:14,314
HEY.

121
00:05:16,024 --> 00:05:17,109
THIS SHOULD LAST US
THE WEEK.

122
00:05:17,192 --> 00:05:18,193
THANKS.

123
00:05:19,194 --> 00:05:20,195
HERE.

124
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:24,324
OH, I WASHED YOUR
WORK CLOTHES.

125
00:05:26,952 --> 00:05:29,079
FOR SOMEONE WHO CLEANS THINGS,
THEY GET PRETTY GROSS.

126
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:30,330
(LAUGHS)

127
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:33,250
ABOUT THAT,
WE NEED TO TALK...

128
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:35,419
OOO - ME FIRST!

129
00:05:35,502 --> 00:05:36,587
CHECK THIS OUT!

130
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:37,963
IT'S A BABY VIDEO MONITOR.

131
00:05:38,046 --> 00:05:39,715

132
00:05:40,716 --> 00:05:42,092

133
00:05:42,176 --> 00:05:44,928
(SIGHS)
IT WOULD MAKE THINGS
SO MUCH EASIER.

134
00:05:45,012 --> 00:05:47,097
AND WE CAN AFFORD IT.

135
00:05:48,098 --> 00:05:51,101
THAT'S WHAT I WANTED
TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT.

136
00:05:54,396 --> 00:05:55,856
I NEED TO QUIT THE JOB
AT THE RESTAURANT.

137
00:05:55,939 --> 00:05:57,274
OH, BUT I THOUGHT
YOU LIKED IT.

138
00:05:57,357 --> 00:05:59,526
I KNOW, BUT I SLEPT
THROUGH MY CLASSES TODAY.

139
00:05:59,610 --> 00:06:01,695
IT'S JUST TOO MUCH.

140
00:06:01,778 --> 00:06:04,615
I'M GOING TO TELL
THEM TONIGHT.

141
00:06:04,698 --> 00:06:06,617
DO WHAT YOU NEED TO DO.

142
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:08,368
YOU'RE TOTALLY MY HERO
EITHER WAY.

143
00:06:21,298 --> 00:06:24,843
WOW. THIS WATCH
MUST'VE COST HEAPS.

144
00:06:24,927 --> 00:06:29,056
AH WELL, MY SON ONLY TURNS
EIGHTEEN ONCE.

145
00:06:29,139 --> 00:06:30,474
YOU KNOW, WHEN I CAME
FROM GREECE,

146
00:06:30,557 --> 00:06:32,559
I IMAGINED A BETTER LIFE
FOR MY KID.

147
00:06:34,770 --> 00:06:38,398
BUT AN ATHLETIC SCHOLARSHIP
FROM AN AMERICAN UNIVERSITY?

148
00:06:38,482 --> 00:06:39,691
I NEVER DREAMED THIS BIG!

149
00:06:39,775 --> 00:06:42,069
YOU'RE THE ONE THAT TAUGHT ME
TO THROW A FOOTBALL, DAD.

150
00:06:42,152 --> 00:06:44,071
HEY, NEVER FORGET THAT.

151
00:06:46,573 --> 00:06:48,033
DO YOU PLAY FOOTBALL,
ZANE?

152
00:06:48,116 --> 00:06:50,869
JUST THE KICKER.
SOCCER'S MY GAME.

153
00:06:50,953 --> 00:06:52,579
I'M BETTER WITH MY FEET.

154
00:06:52,663 --> 00:06:55,874
ENOUGH SPORTS! YOU'RE BORING
ATHENA AND HER MOM.

155
00:06:55,958 --> 00:06:56,834
ATHENA'S AN ATHLETE TOO.

156
00:06:56,917 --> 00:06:59,002
HEY, YOU AND RILEY
HAVE KIDS,

157
00:06:59,086 --> 00:07:01,338
YOU PICK YOUR SPORT,
YOU'RE SET FOR LIFE.

158
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:02,965
EVERYONE:
(LAUGHS)

159
00:07:03,966 --> 00:07:07,177
RILEY'S GIRLFRIEND MAY HAVE
SOMETHING TO SAY ABOUT THAT.

160
00:07:07,261 --> 00:07:09,721
RILEY!
YOU HAVE A GIRLFRIEND?!

161
00:07:09,805 --> 00:07:10,973
YEAH,
SHE'S REALLY PRETTY.

162
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:14,893
BUT YOU SAID THINGS
WERE COMPLICATED.

163
00:07:14,977 --> 00:07:16,144
THEY SURE ARE.

164
00:07:21,108 --> 00:07:23,485
SHE JUST NEEDS TO RELAX.

165
00:07:23,569 --> 00:07:24,736
DOES SHE, NOW?

166
00:07:28,282 --> 00:07:30,534
MR. AND MRS. STAVROS,
THANK YOU FOR DINNER,

167
00:07:30,617 --> 00:07:31,952
BUT I SHOULD GO.

168
00:07:34,496 --> 00:07:36,290
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

169
00:07:36,373 --> 00:07:38,458
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

170
00:07:39,793 --> 00:07:40,836
I CAN'T PLAY ALONG,
RILEY.

171
00:07:40,919 --> 00:07:42,921
WHY ARE YOU SO STRESSED?
JUST HAVE FUN WITH IT!

172
00:07:43,005 --> 00:07:47,384
(WHISPERS)
THERE'S NOTHING
FUN ABOUT THIS.

173
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:49,094
ZANE, PLEASE-

174
00:07:58,020 --> 00:07:59,813
CAN I GO HOME NOW?

175
00:07:59,897 --> 00:08:03,567
WE'VE BEEN WANDERING
THE STREETS FOR HOURS.

176
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:04,818
ALL DONE!

177
00:08:04,902 --> 00:08:07,029
SEE,
BEING CREATIVE IS EASY!

178
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:09,448
YOUR TURN.
DO ME!

179
00:08:13,869 --> 00:08:17,080
WRITING WAS A PASSION
THAT CLARE AND I SHARED.

180
00:08:17,164 --> 00:08:19,833
AND NOW THAT WE'RE
NOT TOGETHER, I'M BROKEN.

181
00:08:21,877 --> 00:08:23,712
HOW COULD YOU STILL BE
IN LOVE WITH SOMEONE

182
00:08:23,795 --> 00:08:25,631
WHO HURT YOU SO MUCH?

183
00:08:25,714 --> 00:08:27,799
I DON'T WANT TO BE!

184
00:08:29,009 --> 00:08:31,053
I WANT TO BE OVER HER!

185
00:08:31,136 --> 00:08:33,514
I CAN HELP WITH THAT.

186
00:08:33,597 --> 00:08:34,598
HOW?

187
00:08:36,517 --> 00:08:38,268
EASY.

188
00:08:38,352 --> 00:08:39,937
YOU NEED TO CONFRONT
CLARE.

189
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:41,605
COME WITH ME.

190
00:08:47,694 --> 00:08:48,612
MARISOL:
HEY THERE,

191
00:08:48,695 --> 00:08:51,448
READY TO GET
YOUR GROOVE ON TONIGHT?

192
00:08:51,532 --> 00:08:54,493
NOT EXACTLY.
I'VE GOTTA QUIT.

193
00:08:55,577 --> 00:08:57,579
AW, BUT WE HAVE
SO MUCH FUN!

194
00:08:57,663 --> 00:08:58,830
YEAH,
BUT I'D MAKE AS MUCH

195
00:08:58,914 --> 00:09:00,666
BEING AT HOME WITH MY KID
ON WELFARE.

196
00:09:00,749 --> 00:09:03,627
SO, LET'S JUST GET YOU
PROMOTED TO BUSBOY THEN.

197
00:09:08,549 --> 00:09:10,384
JUAN,
I'VE GOT A PROPOSAL.

198
00:09:11,301 --> 00:09:14,346
KC'S TALENTS ARE WASTED
IN THE DISH-PIT.

199
00:09:14,429 --> 00:09:17,850
HE'S BUSBOY MATERIAL
AT LEAST.

200
00:09:17,933 --> 00:09:19,309
IS THAT SO?

201
00:09:19,393 --> 00:09:21,562
HE'S CUTE, PERSONABLE,
AND HE'S GOT A KID TO FEED.

202
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:30,112
ALL RIGHT. LET'S TRY IT OUT
FOR A SHIFT AND SEE.

203
00:09:50,048 --> 00:09:51,717
THIS IS SO STUPID.

204
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:54,178
JUST PRETEND I'M CLARE.

205
00:09:54,261 --> 00:09:55,345
YOU CAN'T BE SERIOUS.

206
00:09:55,429 --> 00:09:58,640
COME ON! YOU HAVE SO MUCH YOU
NEED TO GET OFF YOUR CHEST!

207
00:09:58,724 --> 00:10:01,268
YOU AND CLARE'S RELATIONSHIP
WAS AN EMOTIONAL ROLLERCOASTER

208
00:10:01,351 --> 00:10:05,230
AND YOU'RE LETTING HER
GET AWAY WITH IT SCOT-FREE.

209
00:10:05,314 --> 00:10:07,316
WHAT HAVE YOU GOT TO LOSE?

210
00:10:07,399 --> 00:10:08,400
OKAY!

211
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:11,361
IF WE DO THIS
CAN YOU LET IT GO?

212
00:10:15,324 --> 00:10:16,867
I'M CLARE EDWARDS.

213
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:18,327
I'M SO SMART.

214
00:10:19,995 --> 00:10:23,165
NO ONE WILL EVER UNDERSTAND
YOU LIKE I DO, ELI.

215
00:10:23,248 --> 00:10:24,333
OKAY.
THAT'S ENOUGH.

216
00:10:24,416 --> 00:10:25,792
I NEVER REALLY LOVED YOU.

217
00:10:25,876 --> 00:10:26,793
I WAS ONLY PLAYING YOU

218
00:10:26,877 --> 00:10:28,295
BECAUSE I KNEW YOU'D
LET ME GET AWAY WITH IT.

219
00:10:28,378 --> 00:10:30,255
AND LOOK!
I WAS RIGHT!

220
00:10:30,339 --> 00:10:31,757
I DID EVERYTHING
TO MAKE YOU HAPPY!

221
00:10:36,345 --> 00:10:39,181
I'M STILL IN LOVE WITH YOU
AND I HATE MYSELF FOR IT.

222
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:44,269
AND I HATE YOU, ELI.

223
00:10:44,353 --> 00:10:45,687
I ALWAYS HAVE.

224
00:10:46,688 --> 00:10:47,981
DON'T SAY THAT.
YOU DON'T MEAN IT.

225
00:10:48,065 --> 00:10:50,567
I DO.
I NEVER LOVED YOU.

226
00:10:53,487 --> 00:10:55,197
YOU'RE A LOSER.

227
00:10:57,533 --> 00:10:59,826
AND YOU ARE
A MANIPULATIVE WITCH.

228
00:11:01,745 --> 00:11:03,580
YOU USED ME AND YOU
TOSSED ME AWAY.

229
00:11:03,664 --> 00:11:06,041
I HATE YOU. I HATE YOU.
I HATE YOU!

230
00:11:10,295 --> 00:11:11,296
EXCELLENT!

231
00:11:12,673 --> 00:11:16,260
NOW GO USE THAT EMOTION
AND WRITE YOURSELF A PLAY.

232
00:11:16,343 --> 00:11:17,427
BOTH:
(LAUGH)

233
00:11:28,313 --> 00:11:29,398
HEY.

234
00:11:29,481 --> 00:11:30,399
HEY.

235
00:11:30,482 --> 00:11:32,109
WAS YOUR BIRTHDAY
A HAPPY ONE?

236
00:11:32,192 --> 00:11:33,527
HARDLY.

237
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:34,903
YOUR EIGHTEENTH IS SUPPOSED
TO BE SPECIAL!

238
00:11:34,987 --> 00:11:35,946
TELL THAT TO ZANE.

239
00:11:36,029 --> 00:11:38,407
HE AGREED TO COME TO DINNER
AS A FRIEND,

240
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:39,741
BUT HE COULDN'T HANDLE IT.

241
00:11:39,825 --> 00:11:41,535
HE JUST KEPT PUSHING
FOR MORE.

242
00:11:41,618 --> 00:11:43,579
IT'S BECAUSE HE CARES
ABOUT YOU SO MUCH.

243
00:11:43,662 --> 00:11:44,580
DOES HE?

244
00:11:44,663 --> 00:11:47,124
HE WANTS ME TO CHOOSE
BETWEEN HIM AND MY FAMILY.

245
00:11:47,207 --> 00:11:49,001
BUT IF I TRY TO DROP
THE GAY BOMB AGAIN,

246
00:11:49,084 --> 00:11:52,045
THAT'S IT. MY WHOLE FAMILY
WOULD BE OVER.

247
00:11:52,129 --> 00:11:55,132
WELL, AND IF YOU DON'T,
YOU LOSE ZANE.

248
00:11:55,215 --> 00:11:56,675
BOTH OPTIONS BITE.

249
00:11:57,676 --> 00:11:59,887
WELL, HONESTY IS USUALLY
THE BEST POLICY.

250
00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:01,763
THAT'S WHAT
THEY TELL ME, ANYWAY.

251
00:12:01,847 --> 00:12:02,848
SINCE WHEN?

252
00:12:03,849 --> 00:12:04,850
GOOD POINT.

253
00:12:04,933 --> 00:12:06,268
I THINK WHAT
I'M TRYING TO SAY,

254
00:12:06,351 --> 00:12:07,436
IS THAT ZANE'S PUT UP
WITH A LOT.

255
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:08,604
AND YOU STAYING
IN THE CLOSET-

256
00:12:08,687 --> 00:12:10,856
REALLY ISN'T FAIR TO HIM.

257
00:12:11,857 --> 00:12:14,610
WELL, DO WHAT YOU GOTTA DO.

258
00:12:19,531 --> 00:12:21,325
MY NEW CONCEPT
WILL EXPAND HORIZONS.

259
00:12:21,408 --> 00:12:22,451
ELEVATE CONSCIOUSNESS.

260
00:12:22,534 --> 00:12:23,619
IT'S BRILLIANT, ELI.

261
00:12:23,702 --> 00:12:25,996
I CAN ALREADY HEAR
THE STANDING OVATION.

262
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:27,956
YOU WERE RIGHT. THOSE PILLS
WERE THE PROBLEM.

263
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:30,626
THANKS TO YOU,
I'M FINALLY FREE.

264
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,378
CLARE:
ELI?

265
00:12:35,339 --> 00:12:37,132
CLARE.

266
00:12:37,216 --> 00:12:39,051
DO YOU KNOW IMOGEN?

267
00:12:39,134 --> 00:12:40,260
HI.

268
00:12:40,344 --> 00:12:42,888
HELLO, CLARE EDWARDS.

269
00:12:42,971 --> 00:12:44,306
I STILL NEED
THAT INTERVIEW.

270
00:12:44,389 --> 00:12:46,099
AND I WANT TO GIVE IT
TO YOU.

271
00:12:47,559 --> 00:12:50,687
I PITCH MY NEW CONCEPT
TO FIONA IN THE MORNING.

272
00:12:50,771 --> 00:12:52,481
HOW ABOUT LUNCH?

273
00:12:52,564 --> 00:12:53,482
SOUNDS GREAT.

274
00:12:53,565 --> 00:12:54,566
IT'S A DATE.

275
00:13:06,119 --> 00:13:08,622
I COULDN'T QUIT WHEN THEY
OFFERED ME THE RAISE.

276
00:13:08,705 --> 00:13:09,748
I HOPE YOU'RE NOT MAD?

277
00:13:09,831 --> 00:13:11,917
ARE YOU KIDDING?
I AM SO PROUD.

278
00:13:14,878 --> 00:13:15,796
IN THIS UNIFORM?

279
00:13:15,879 --> 00:13:16,880
(LAUGHS)

280
00:13:16,964 --> 00:13:19,716
YOU WORK SO HARD FOR ME
AND TYSON,

281
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,176
CLIMBING THE CORPORATE
LADDER.

282
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:21,844
BOTH:
(LAUGH)

283
00:13:21,927 --> 00:13:22,845
I CAN'T TAKE ALL THE CREDIT.

284
00:13:22,928 --> 00:13:26,223
THIS GIRL AT WORK REALLY
WENT TO BAT FOR ME.

285
00:13:26,306 --> 00:13:27,307
THIS GIRL AT WORK?

286
00:13:27,391 --> 00:13:29,226
YEAH, MARISOL.

287
00:13:29,309 --> 00:13:31,478
OH, HOW NICE OF HER.

288
00:13:33,355 --> 00:13:35,524
IT'S NOT LIKE THAT.

289
00:13:35,607 --> 00:13:38,902
I USED TO BE ON POWER SQUAD
WITH MS. FLIRTY FLIRT, KC.

290
00:13:38,986 --> 00:13:39,987
I KNOW HER TYPE.

291
00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:41,989
I USED TO BE HER TYPE.

292
00:13:42,072 --> 00:13:43,323
JENNA,
SHE GETS OUR SITUATION.

293
00:13:43,407 --> 00:13:45,534
AND SHE JUST WANTS
TO HELP US.

294
00:13:45,617 --> 00:13:46,618
(SIGHS)

295
00:13:46,702 --> 00:13:48,287
(CRYING BABY)

296
00:13:57,713 --> 00:14:00,048
TO A BAGGAGE-FREE FUTURE!

297
00:14:00,132 --> 00:14:02,718
AND BY BAGGAGE
I MEAN CLARE.

298
00:14:02,801 --> 00:14:04,386
YOU KNOW, I HAVE TO HAND IT
TO YOU, YOUR METHODS WORKED.

299
00:14:04,469 --> 00:14:07,556
JUST WAIT UNTIL YOU SHARE YOUR
BRILLIANT PLAY IDEA WITH HER.

300
00:14:07,639 --> 00:14:09,057
(LAUGHS)
SHE'LL REALIZE LOSING ME
IS THE BIGGEST MISTAKE

301
00:14:09,141 --> 00:14:10,309
SHE EVER MADE.

302
00:14:10,392 --> 00:14:12,644
SHE'LL NEVER DOUBT
YOU AGAIN.

303
00:14:14,730 --> 00:14:16,982
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

304
00:14:17,065 --> 00:14:20,277
YOU KNOW, JUST ALWAYS SEEMED
LIKE SHE SECOND GUESSED YOU.

305
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:22,279
(LAUGHS)
LIKE WHEN?

306
00:14:22,362 --> 00:14:23,864
LIKE VEGAS NIGHT.

307
00:14:23,947 --> 00:14:25,949
WHEN SHE TOOK FITZ'S SIDE
INSTEAD OF YOURS.

308
00:14:26,033 --> 00:14:27,951
IT WAS SO CLEAR
FITZ WAS PLAYING CLARE

309
00:14:28,035 --> 00:14:29,745
AND YOU WERE ONLY
LOOKING OUT FOR HER

310
00:14:29,828 --> 00:14:31,997
BUT SHE WOULDN'T LISTEN.

311
00:14:33,665 --> 00:14:36,585
THAT HAPPENED MONTHS AGO.

312
00:14:36,668 --> 00:14:37,711
(LAUGHS)

313
00:14:37,794 --> 00:14:39,213
HOW DO YOU KNOW
ABOUT THAT?

314
00:14:39,296 --> 00:14:42,424
YOU KNOW,
IT'S COMMON KNOWLEDGE.

315
00:14:42,508 --> 00:14:43,634
LIKE THE GOTHIC FICTION
FESTIVAL

316
00:14:43,717 --> 00:14:45,886
YOU WERE GOING
TO TAKE CLARE TO.

317
00:14:47,721 --> 00:14:48,847
HAVE YOU BEEN
STALKING ME?

318
00:14:48,931 --> 00:14:50,265
NO.

319
00:14:50,349 --> 00:14:52,184
I'M JUST A KEEN OBSERVER
OF HUMAN BEHAVIOUR.

320
00:14:52,267 --> 00:14:54,019
OKAY,
YOU NEED TO BACK OFF.

321
00:14:59,191 --> 00:15:01,693
DEEP BREATHS, ELI.
DEEP BREATHS.

322
00:15:06,532 --> 00:15:10,452
DON'T LET THE CRAZY
GET THE BEST OF YOU.

323
00:15:10,536 --> 00:15:12,037
THAT'S WHAT CLARE WANTS.

324
00:15:23,048 --> 00:15:24,049
GOOD.

325
00:15:25,384 --> 00:15:27,886
NOW LET'S GET READY TO PITCH
FIONA YOUR CONCEPT.

326
00:15:36,228 --> 00:15:37,771
I KNEW YOU'D LOOK CUTE
IN A KERCHIEF.

327
00:15:37,855 --> 00:15:38,897
THANKS.

328
00:15:40,065 --> 00:15:43,318
YOU KNOW, IT'S TOO BAD
MY MP3 PLAYER'S BROKEN,

329
00:15:43,402 --> 00:15:46,738
SO THERE WON'T BE
A DANCE PARTY TONIGHT.

330
00:15:47,406 --> 00:15:49,616
WELL,
I CAN'T MAKE IT ANYWAY.

331
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:51,952
GOTTA GET HOME TO TAKE CARE
OF MY KID AND BABY MAMA.

332
00:15:54,872 --> 00:15:55,914
GOTCHA.

333
00:15:58,458 --> 00:15:59,459
MARISOL?

334
00:16:01,628 --> 00:16:03,589
I GUESS I KINDA
OWE YOU, HUH?

335
00:16:05,090 --> 00:16:06,925
DON'T BE SILLY.

336
00:16:07,009 --> 00:16:09,219
I'M JUST GLAD I COULD HELP,
BUSBOY.

337
00:16:09,303 --> 00:16:11,388
(LAUGHS)
COME HERE.

338
00:16:20,105 --> 00:16:21,440
THANK YOU.

339
00:16:47,591 --> 00:16:48,592
HEY.

340
00:16:51,178 --> 00:16:52,137
GLAD YOU CAME.

341
00:16:52,221 --> 00:16:54,348
LEAST I COULD DO.

342
00:16:54,431 --> 00:16:57,559
I GOT YOUR TEXT ABOUT
THE BIG DECISION, SO...

343
00:16:57,643 --> 00:16:58,977
WHAT'S THE PLAN?

344
00:16:59,061 --> 00:16:59,978
PLAN?

345
00:17:00,062 --> 00:17:02,022
YEAH, WE'LL NEED A STRATEGY
TO COME OUT TO YOUR FOLKS,

346
00:17:02,105 --> 00:17:05,234
SO THINGS DON'T END UP
LIKE LAST TIME, RIGHT?

347
00:17:06,276 --> 00:17:08,195
MAYBE YOU SHOULD
TAKE A SEAT.

348
00:17:21,416 --> 00:17:24,169
ABOUT DINNER YESTERDAY,

349
00:17:24,253 --> 00:17:27,297
I CAN'T KEEP PUTTING YOU
THROUGH STUFF LIKE THAT.

350
00:17:27,381 --> 00:17:28,298
I'M SORRY.

351
00:17:28,382 --> 00:17:29,383
SEE?

352
00:17:30,968 --> 00:17:33,804
YOU CAN'T HAVE IT
BOTH WAYS.

353
00:17:35,848 --> 00:17:38,851
THAT'S WHY
WE SHOULD BREAK UP.

354
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:44,064
WHAT?
I KNOW YOU'RE NOT HAPPY
THE WAY THINGS ARE.

355
00:17:44,147 --> 00:17:45,983
SO WHY DON'T WE CHANGE
THE WAY THINGS ARE?

356
00:17:46,066 --> 00:17:47,985
WHY DON'T WE STOP
PLAYING PRETEND

357
00:17:48,068 --> 00:17:49,611
AND COME OUT TO YOUR PARENTS
TOGETHER?

358
00:17:49,695 --> 00:17:51,029
YOU KNOW WHY!

359
00:17:51,113 --> 00:17:52,573
AND JUST BECAUSE YOU'RE
IN SOME SORT OF HURRY,

360
00:17:52,656 --> 00:17:55,325
DOESN'T CHANGE ANYTHING!

361
00:17:55,409 --> 00:17:57,286
I'VE MADE MY DECISION.

362
00:17:57,369 --> 00:18:01,081
I'M SORRY IF YOU
CAN'T RESPECT IT.

363
00:18:01,164 --> 00:18:02,332
SO THIS-

364
00:18:05,711 --> 00:18:07,880
THIS IS HOW IT ENDS?

365
00:18:09,173 --> 00:18:10,507
IT HAS TO.

366
00:18:29,109 --> 00:18:31,195
ELI:
AND THEN- BAM!

367
00:18:32,821 --> 00:18:34,281
OUR HERO COLLAPSES,

368
00:18:34,364 --> 00:18:35,866
A CROWD GATHERS,
SIRENS BLARE.

369
00:18:37,743 --> 00:18:40,329
AND THE TRUTH IS LAID NAKED,
FOR ALL TO SEE.

370
00:18:40,412 --> 00:18:41,371
LIGHTS DIM.

371
00:18:42,289 --> 00:18:43,582
CURTAINS.

372
00:18:46,251 --> 00:18:47,252
APPLAUSE.

373
00:18:51,256 --> 00:18:53,217
I HAVE CHILLS.
CHILLS!

374
00:18:54,218 --> 00:18:55,427
I KNEW YOU COULD DO IT.

375
00:18:55,511 --> 00:18:56,553
THANK YOU.

376
00:18:56,637 --> 00:18:59,264
NOW ALL YOU HAVE TO DO
IS WRITE IT.

377
00:18:59,348 --> 00:19:01,225
DO YOU THINK DAWES
WILL LIKE IT?

378
00:19:01,308 --> 00:19:03,268
LEAVE THAT TO ME.

379
00:19:05,938 --> 00:19:08,232
IMOGEN:
BRA-VO. BRA-FREAKIN'-VO!

380
00:19:09,691 --> 00:19:13,111
I ALWAYS HAD IT IN ME.
AND YOU...

381
00:19:13,195 --> 00:19:15,531
YOU BELIEVED IN ME!

382
00:19:15,614 --> 00:19:18,450
YOU'VE CONQUERED
YOUR DEMONS.

383
00:19:18,534 --> 00:19:19,618
WHAT HAPPENS NEXT
IS UP TO YOU.

384
00:19:37,761 --> 00:19:40,180
HOW WAS CLOSING
LAST NIGHT?

385
00:19:40,264 --> 00:19:42,850
NOT THE SAME
WITHOUT YOU.

386
00:19:42,933 --> 00:19:45,435
MAYBE NEXT TIME
IT WILL BE MORE FUN.

387
00:19:47,479 --> 00:19:50,858
KC! THIS MUST HAVE
BEEN SO EXPENSIVE!

388
00:19:51,733 --> 00:19:53,861
IT WASN'T.
REALLY.

389
00:19:53,944 --> 00:19:56,989
I HAD TO BUY JENNA A BABY
VIDEO MONITOR. (LAUGHS)

390
00:19:57,072 --> 00:19:58,991
THAT WAS EXPENSIVE.

391
00:19:59,074 --> 00:20:01,743
YOU'RE RIDICULOUS,
YOU KNOW THAT? (LAUGHS)

392
00:20:04,121 --> 00:20:05,956
I'LL SAVE A DANCE
FOR YOU TONIGHT.

393
00:20:25,767 --> 00:20:26,727
HEY.

394
00:20:26,810 --> 00:20:27,728
HOW DID THE PITCH GO?

395
00:20:27,811 --> 00:20:30,230
I REALLY, REALLY NEED
TO THANK YOU.

396
00:20:30,314 --> 00:20:31,231
THANK ME?

397
00:20:31,315 --> 00:20:35,068
YES! YOU INSPIRED ME.
YOU WERE MY MUSE!

398
00:20:36,111 --> 00:20:38,113
THAT'S GREAT, ELI!

399
00:20:39,114 --> 00:20:41,992
I'M REALLY GLAD
I COULD HELP.

400
00:20:46,622 --> 00:20:47,539
SO WHAT'S THE PLAY
ABOUT?

401
00:20:47,623 --> 00:20:48,665
(LAUGHS) RIGHT.

402
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:51,668
IT'S CALLED "LOVE ROULETTE".

403
00:20:52,753 --> 00:20:55,130
A TALE OF HIGH SCHOOL
ROMANCE GONE WRONG.

404
00:20:55,214 --> 00:20:56,965
THE HERO'S BETRAYED
AT THE SCHOOL DANCE

405
00:20:57,049 --> 00:20:58,634
BY A MANIPULATIVE LOVER,

406
00:20:58,717 --> 00:21:02,888
WHO'S BECOME OBSESSED
WITH A RELIGIOUS PSYCHO.

407
00:21:02,971 --> 00:21:04,223
SOUND FAMILIAR?

408
00:21:04,306 --> 00:21:05,349
IT'S A LIE.
YOU CAN'T.

409
00:21:05,432 --> 00:21:06,892
I THOUGHT I WAS THE REASON

410
00:21:06,975 --> 00:21:07,935
EVERYTHING FELL APART
BETWEEN US,

411
00:21:08,018 --> 00:21:10,395
BUT NOW I KNOW THE TRUTH,

412
00:21:10,479 --> 00:21:12,105
IT WAS YOU.

413
00:21:12,189 --> 00:21:13,690
YOU SOUND CRAZY, ELI.

414
00:21:13,774 --> 00:21:14,983
HAVE YOU BEEN TAKING
YOUR MEDICATION?

415
00:21:15,067 --> 00:21:16,360
NO. I'M BETTER.

416
00:21:17,486 --> 00:21:19,488
I DON'T LOVE YOU ANYMORE,
CLARE. I'M FREE!

417
00:21:22,282 --> 00:21:24,076
YOU NEED HELP!

418
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:25,577
I HAVE ALL THE HELP
I NEED.

419
00:21:25,661 --> 00:21:27,704
AT YOUR SERVICE,
ELI GOLDSWORTHY.

420
00:21:31,667 --> 00:21:32,709
COME ON, IMO.

421
00:21:33,669 --> 00:21:34,837
I'VE GOT A PLAY TO WRITE!
