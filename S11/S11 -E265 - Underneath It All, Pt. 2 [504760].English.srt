LOOK AT THIS MESS!

3
00:00:05,005 --> 00:00:05,923
YOU KNOW,
BREAKING IN AFTER HOURS

4
00:00:06,006 --> 00:00:08,842
AND DAMAGING SCHOOL PROPERTY
IS A VERY SERIOUS OFFENCE.

5
00:00:08,926 --> 00:00:10,302
ANY IDEA WHO WAS INVOLVED?

6
00:00:10,385 --> 00:00:12,429
I DON'T KNOW, IT'S-
LOOKS LIKE A GRAD PRANK.

7
00:00:12,513 --> 00:00:14,264
THE CLEANING STAFF FOUND
A STUDENT HERE LAST NIGHT,

8
00:00:14,348 --> 00:00:15,933
SHE'S BEEN SUSPENDED
FOR THE DAY.

9
00:00:16,016 --> 00:00:18,101
FIONA:
SIMPSON LOOKS MAD.

10
00:00:18,185 --> 00:00:20,062
MARISOL:
GREAT. WE PISSED OFF
THE PRINCIPAL

11
00:00:20,145 --> 00:00:21,939
THE FIRST WEEK OF SCHOOL.

12
00:00:22,022 --> 00:00:22,940
DON'T PANIC.

13
00:00:23,023 --> 00:00:25,275
MAYBE IMOGEN GOT OUT BEFORE
THE CLEANERS CAUGHT HER.

14
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:26,610
OR MAYBE SHE DIDN'T,

15
00:00:26,693 --> 00:00:28,779
AND SHE'S ALREADY
RATTED US OUT.

16
00:00:28,862 --> 00:00:29,613
SIMPSON:
WHEN I FIND OUT
WHO IS RESPONSIBLE

17
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:31,823
THERE WILL BE CONSEQUENCES.

18
00:00:31,907 --> 00:00:36,036
MARISOL:
KATIE AND I COULD LOSE OUR
STUDENT COUNCIL POSITIONS.

19
00:00:36,119 --> 00:00:38,038
MAYBE GET EXPELLED.

20
00:00:38,121 --> 00:00:39,456
THEN I'LL TAKE THE BLAME.

21
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:41,458
TELL SIMPSON
IT WAS ALL MY FAULT.

22
00:00:41,542 --> 00:00:43,168
MAYBE HE'LL GO EASY
ON EVERYONE.

23
00:00:43,252 --> 00:00:44,169
DON'T YOU DARE!

24
00:00:44,253 --> 00:00:46,296
SIMPSON DOESN'T KNOW
ANYONE ELSE WAS INVOLVED.

25
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:48,131
IMOGEN'S SUSPENDED
FOR THE DAY.

26
00:00:48,215 --> 00:00:49,967
HE'S QUESTIONING HER
LATER SO...

27
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:51,134
WHAT IF SHE SAYS
SOMETHING?

28
00:00:51,218 --> 00:00:52,135
MARISOL:
THEN WE'LL DENY IT.

29
00:00:52,219 --> 00:00:55,556
TELL THE PRINCIPAL WE DIDN'T
INVITE IMOGEN TO A PARTY

30
00:00:55,639 --> 00:00:56,598
AND SHE HAS A GRUDGE.

31
00:00:56,682 --> 00:00:57,432
WHO'S HE GONNA BELIEVE -

32
00:00:57,516 --> 00:00:59,142
THE CLASS CRACKPOT

33
00:00:59,226 --> 00:01:01,019
OR THE THREE OF US?

34
00:01:01,103 --> 00:01:02,646
OF COURSE,
IT WOULD BE EASIER

35
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:05,899
IF SOMEONE COULD KEEP
HER QUIET.

36
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:08,193
YOU WANT ME TO TALK
TO HER?

37
00:01:08,277 --> 00:01:09,987
WE WARNED YOU
NOT TO INVITE HER.

38
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:11,572
I FELT BAD
SHE HAD NO FRIENDS.

39
00:01:11,655 --> 00:01:13,490
NOW YOU KNOW WHY.

40
00:01:13,574 --> 00:01:14,575
(SIGHS)

41
00:01:16,326 --> 00:01:19,121
OKAY, UH...
I'LL SKIP MY FIRST CLASS.

42
00:01:19,204 --> 00:01:20,455
GO TO HER HOUSE.

43
00:01:20,539 --> 00:01:22,374
CONVINCE HER TO KEEP QUIET.

44
00:01:22,457 --> 00:01:23,667
KATIE:
THE ONLY WAY
WE'LL SURVIVE THIS

45
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:26,795
IS IF THE THREE OF US
STICK TOGETHER.

ABOUT LAST NIGHT...

YOU DON'T HAVE
TO APOLOGIZE.

69
00:02:33,195 --> 00:02:34,238
FOR WHAT?

70
00:02:34,321 --> 00:02:34,905
GETTING CAUGHT.

71
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:35,906
THE ONLY THING
THAT MATTERS

72
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:37,407
IS WHEN YOU GO TO SCHOOL
THIS AFTERNOON,

73
00:02:37,491 --> 00:02:39,660
YOU CAN'T SAY THAT ANYONE
ELSE WAS INVOLVED.

74
00:02:39,743 --> 00:02:41,662
SO YOU WANT ME
TO BE THE SCAPEGOAT?

75
00:02:41,745 --> 00:02:43,247
IT'S ONLY FAIR. YOU'RE
THE ONE WHO GOT CAUGHT.

IT WASN'T MY FAULT!

I WAS LISTENING TO MY IPOD
IN THE THEATRE,

78
00:02:47,292 --> 00:02:49,127
AND THE NEXT THING I KNOW,
THE DOOR WAS LOCKED.

79
00:02:49,211 --> 00:02:51,213
WHO WOULD'VE DONE THAT?

80
00:02:52,214 --> 00:02:54,299
MARISOL WAS WITH ME.

81
00:02:54,383 --> 00:02:55,384
WHY IS IT SO HARD
FOR YOU

82
00:02:55,467 --> 00:02:57,094
TO JUST TRY TO FIT IN
WITH EVERYONE?

83
00:02:57,177 --> 00:02:59,596
YOU WERE DIFFERENT
LAST YEAR.

84
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:03,517
NOW ALL YOU CARE ABOUT IS BEING
ACCEPTED BY THE POPULARS.

85
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:04,768
TELL SIMPSON ANYONE
ELSE WAS INVOLVED

86
00:03:04,852 --> 00:03:06,395
AND WE'LL DENY IT.

THEN BROKE UP.

GET OVER THAT,

108

CAN HANG OUT TOGETHER.

THIS MORNING.

127

DIDN'T GIVE ME A CHANCE TO
APOLOGIZE FOR BEING A JERK.

THE STUFF I SAID,
IT WAS-

130

IT WAS STUPID
AND IMMATURE.

131
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:01,802

SAY THE RIGHT THING

TO MAKE ME FEEL READY.

WHAT THAT IS.

DOES THAT MEAN?

ARE OUT TONIGHT.

LOCKED HER IN.

PLEASE DON'T DO THIS.

173
00:06:54,915 --> 00:06:56,917
A WEEK SUSPENSION.

00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:15,769
I WAS SITTING IN CLASS,
TUNING MY TROMBONE,

180
00:07:15,853 --> 00:07:17,479
WHEN MAYA LUNGED
AT ME.

181
00:07:17,563 --> 00:07:18,897
BECAUSE TORI SPIT AT ME.

182
00:07:18,981 --> 00:07:20,274
THAT'S A LIE.

183
00:07:20,357 --> 00:07:21,358
MAYA:
PRINCIPAL SIMPSON,

184
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:24,528
THIS ALL HAPPENED
CUZ TORI IS JEALOUS

185
00:07:24,611 --> 00:07:26,363
I'VE BEEN HANGING OUT
WITH THE GUY SHE LIKES.

186
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:27,823
ALSO A LIE.

187
00:07:29,283 --> 00:07:30,158
DO YOU KNOW
HOW DISAPPOINTING IT IS

188
00:07:30,242 --> 00:07:31,952
TO SEE TWO SMART GIRLS
FIGHT OVER A GUY

189
00:07:32,035 --> 00:07:34,121
THE FIRST WEEK OF SCHOOL?

190
00:07:35,289 --> 00:07:38,500
OKAY. I'M GONNA LEAVE
FOR FIVE MINUTES.

191
00:07:38,584 --> 00:07:40,210
WORK THINGS OUT?
ONE WEEKS' DETENTION.

192
00:07:40,294 --> 00:07:41,461
IF YOU'RE STILL AT EACH OTHER'S
THROATS WHEN I GET BACK?

193
00:07:41,545 --> 00:07:42,629
I'LL MAKE IT THREE.
GOT IT?

194
00:07:42,713 --> 00:07:43,672
BOTH:
YES, SIR.

195
00:07:43,755 --> 00:07:44,756
GOOD.

196
00:07:50,387 --> 00:07:51,555
(CRYING)

197
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:55,851
IF THIS IS YOUR PLAN
TO MAKE ME TAKE THE BLAME-

198
00:07:55,934 --> 00:07:58,478
ONE DAY,
ZIG AND I WERE HAPPY.

199
00:07:58,562 --> 00:08:01,899
THE NEXT, HE WOULDN'T
ANSWER MY TEXTS.

200
00:08:01,982 --> 00:08:04,193
I NEED TO KNOW
WHAT I DID WRONG.

201
00:08:04,276 --> 00:08:06,278
I NEED, LIKE, CLOSURE.

202
00:08:08,155 --> 00:08:09,948
I WISH I COULD HELP...

203
00:08:10,032 --> 00:08:11,450
YOU CAN!

204
00:08:11,533 --> 00:08:14,119
YOU COULD TALK
TO ZIG FOR ME.

205
00:08:14,203 --> 00:08:15,287
OKAY. FINE.

206
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:17,206
BUT COULD YOU GET OFF
OF ME.

207
00:08:17,289 --> 00:08:19,791
YOU'RE GETTING SNOT
ON MY SHIRT.

208
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:24,755
PERINO:
IN GRADE TWELVE HISTORY,

209
00:08:24,838 --> 00:08:26,924
WE DON'T TAKE A HISTORIAN'S
WORD FOR IT.

210
00:08:27,007 --> 00:08:29,760
WE DIG DEEPER.
WE SEARCH PRIMARY SOURCES

211
00:08:29,843 --> 00:08:33,305
AND WE ANALYZE THEM -
AM I BORING YOU, MR. MARTIN?

212
00:08:33,388 --> 00:08:34,431
UH, NO, SIR.

213
00:08:34,515 --> 00:08:37,601
PERINO:
THEN WHY ARE YOU READING
SIZZLE TEEN, HMMM?

214
00:08:37,684 --> 00:08:39,269
OH, LOOK, LET'S SEE WHAT
CHARLOTTE FROM VIRGINIA

215
00:08:39,353 --> 00:08:40,354
HAS TO SAY.

216
00:08:40,437 --> 00:08:41,897
DEAR SIZZLE TEEN,

217
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:45,108
I THOUGHT ME AND MY BOYFRIEND
WOULD BE TOGETHER FOREVER

218
00:08:45,192 --> 00:08:46,652
SO I AGREED TO HAVE SEX.

219
00:08:46,735 --> 00:08:50,113
AND THEN, LIKE, A MONTH LATER,
BAM! HE BROKE UP WITH ME.

220
00:08:50,197 --> 00:08:53,909
AND NOW I'LL NEVER GET
MY FIRST TIME BACK.

221
00:08:53,992 --> 00:08:56,703
WELL CLASS,
WHAT DO WE HAVE HERE?

222
00:08:58,372 --> 00:08:59,498
A PRIMARY SOURCE.

223
00:08:59,581 --> 00:09:00,707
PERINO:
EXACTLY.

224
00:09:00,791 --> 00:09:02,709
BUT DO WE BUY HER STORY?

225
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:05,295
BIANCA:
HAPPENS ALL THE TIME.

226
00:09:05,379 --> 00:09:07,297
A GUY LIES TO GET HER
INTO BED.

227
00:09:07,381 --> 00:09:09,216
MAYBE HE DIDN'T LIE.

228
00:09:10,217 --> 00:09:12,094
MAYBE THE SHE ASSUMED
THEY'D BE TOGETHER FOREVER.

229
00:09:12,177 --> 00:09:14,054
BECAUSE THE GUY LET HER.

230
00:09:14,137 --> 00:09:14,847
(CLASS LAUGHS)

231
00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:17,057
PERINO:
ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU.
ENOUGH, MISS DESOUSA.

232
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:18,141
(BELL RINGS)

233
00:09:21,186 --> 00:09:22,354
NOBODY EXPECTS A HIGH SCHOOL
RELATIONSHIP

234
00:09:22,437 --> 00:09:23,438
TO END IN MARRIAGE.

235
00:09:23,522 --> 00:09:24,940
CHARLOTTE DID.

236
00:09:25,023 --> 00:09:26,817
AND IF HER GUY KNEW THAT,

237
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:29,528
HE SHOULDN'T HAVE JUMPED
IN THE SACK.

238
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:36,410
SIMPSON:
I CAN'T PHANTOM WHY YOU WOULD
DO SOMETHING SO IDIOTIC!

239
00:09:36,493 --> 00:09:38,328
I'M NOT IMPRESSED, IMOGEN.

240
00:09:38,412 --> 00:09:40,664
THIS IS NOT THE WAY TO BEGIN
A SCHOOL YEAR.

241
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:45,377
HOW'D IT GO?

242
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:46,920
LOOK, I WANT TO MAKE IT UP
TO YOU. A MOVIE?

243
00:09:47,004 --> 00:09:48,839
A MOVIE?
OR DINNER.

244
00:09:48,922 --> 00:09:50,132
THERE'S A GREAT
NEW ITALIAN PLACE

245
00:09:50,215 --> 00:09:52,009
THAT MAKES THE BEST
TIRAMISU.

246
00:09:52,092 --> 00:09:53,051
I'M SUSPENDED FOR A MONTH.

247
00:09:53,135 --> 00:09:54,928
ON PROBATION INDEFINITELY.

248
00:09:55,012 --> 00:09:56,638
FOR TIN-FOILING THE CAF?

249
00:09:56,722 --> 00:09:57,723
IMOGEN:
FOR BREAKING IN AFTER HOURS,

250
00:09:57,806 --> 00:09:59,224
VANDALIZING SCHOOL PROPERTY.

251
00:09:59,308 --> 00:10:01,685
OH, AND DID YOU KNOW I BUSTED
A VENDING MACHINE?

252
00:10:01,768 --> 00:10:03,020
THAT'S INSANE!

253
00:10:03,103 --> 00:10:03,937
I THOUGHT SO TOO.

254
00:10:04,021 --> 00:10:06,940
SO I TRIED TO TELL SIMPSON
THE TRUTH.

255
00:10:07,024 --> 00:10:08,233
HE SAID IT WAS SUSPICIOUS
THAT I WAITED

256
00:10:08,317 --> 00:10:11,403
UNTIL AFTER THE PUNISHMENT
WAS DOLED OUT.

257
00:10:11,486 --> 00:10:13,155
LOOK, I'M SO,
SO SORRY.

258
00:10:13,238 --> 00:10:15,574
I CAN'T BELIEVE I WANTED
TO BE YOUR FRIEND.

259
00:10:15,657 --> 00:10:19,411
YOU'RE JUST AS A BAD
AS KATIE AND MARISOL.

260
00:10:19,494 --> 00:10:20,746
MAYBE THERE'S
SOMETHING I CAN DO.

261
00:10:20,829 --> 00:10:22,581
LEAVE ME ALONE.

262
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:26,126
(SIGHS)

263
00:10:26,835 --> 00:10:28,462
IMOGEN IS SUSPENDED
FOR A MONTH?

264
00:10:28,545 --> 00:10:30,380
AND ON PROBATION INDEFINITELY.

265
00:10:31,048 --> 00:10:32,883
I CAN'T BELIEVE SIMPSON
CAME DOWN THAT HARD.

266
00:10:32,966 --> 00:10:34,510
HE USED TO BE SUCH
A SOFTIE.

267
00:10:34,593 --> 00:10:37,763
WHICH IS WHY THERE'S
ONLY ONE THING WE CAN DO.

268
00:10:37,846 --> 00:10:40,015
WE HAVE TO CONFESS.

269
00:10:40,098 --> 00:10:41,600
UH, WHY WOULD WE DO THAT?

270
00:10:41,683 --> 00:10:43,685
BECAUSE IT'LL FORCE HIM
TO BE MORE LENIENT.

271
00:10:43,769 --> 00:10:46,063
HE CAN'T SUSPEND TWENTY SENIORS
FOR AN ENTIRE MONTH.

272
00:10:46,146 --> 00:10:47,731
WE DON'T KNOW THAT.

273
00:10:47,814 --> 00:10:49,316
WELL, IT'S WORTH A SHOT.

274
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:50,817
SO YOU'RE GONNA DO THIS
WITH OR WITHOUT US,

275
00:10:50,901 --> 00:10:52,319
AREN'T YOU?

276
00:10:52,402 --> 00:10:54,238
I DON'T HAVE A CHOICE.

277
00:10:56,323 --> 00:10:57,950
THEN NEITHER DO WE.

278
00:10:59,284 --> 00:11:00,744
MARE,
YOU CAN'T BE SERIOUS!

279
00:11:00,827 --> 00:11:02,704
THIS IS IMPORTANT TO FIONA.

280
00:11:03,705 --> 00:11:05,457
AND SHE'S IMPORTANT TO US.

281
00:11:06,458 --> 00:11:08,460
THANK YOU!
THANK YOU! THANK YOU!

282
00:11:08,544 --> 00:11:10,295
I KNEW YOU GUYS
WERE GOOD FRIENDS.

283
00:11:10,379 --> 00:11:13,215
I'LL CALL AND SET UP A MEETING
WITH SIMPSON AFTER SCHOOL.

284
00:11:13,298 --> 00:11:15,300
MARISOL:
WE'LL BE THERE!

285
00:11:25,269 --> 00:11:27,563
HEY, CAN WE TALK?

286
00:11:27,646 --> 00:11:29,481
OKAY, BUT FIRST -

287
00:11:33,318 --> 00:11:35,237
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

288
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:37,614
YEAH. I'M NOT READY
TO GET MARRIED.

289
00:11:37,698 --> 00:11:38,615
JAKE-

290
00:11:38,699 --> 00:11:40,909
THIS MORNING YOU SOUNDED
READY TO SET A DATE.

291
00:11:40,993 --> 00:11:44,162
YOU SAID "I DON'T NEED TO WAIT
'TIL WE'RE READY TO HAVE SEX."

292
00:11:44,246 --> 00:11:46,456
WE AS IN YOU AND ME.

293
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:48,584
OBVIOUSLY, I CAN SEE MYSELF
MARRYING YOU IN THE FUTURE.

294
00:11:48,667 --> 00:11:50,335
OTHERWISE,
WE WOULDN'T BE TOGETHER.

295
00:11:50,419 --> 00:11:52,462
BUT I KNOW IT'S NOT
A SURE THING.

296
00:11:52,546 --> 00:11:53,505
YOU DO?

297
00:11:53,589 --> 00:11:54,673
SOMETIMES PEOPLE BREAK UP.

298
00:11:54,756 --> 00:11:56,425
OUR PARENTS.
ME AND ELI.

299
00:11:56,508 --> 00:11:59,261
SO IF WE BROKE UP
SOMETIME IN THE FUTURE,

300
00:11:59,344 --> 00:12:01,138
YOU WON'T REGRET
THAT I WAS YOUR FIRST?

301
00:12:01,221 --> 00:12:02,222
YOU LOVE ME,
DON'T YOU?

302
00:12:02,306 --> 00:12:03,432
OF COURSE.

303
00:12:03,515 --> 00:12:04,683
AND I LOVE YOU TOO.

304
00:12:04,766 --> 00:12:07,144
SO AS LONG AS YOU'RE A 100%
COMMITTED RIGHT NOW.

305
00:12:07,227 --> 00:12:08,228
I AM.

306
00:12:10,856 --> 00:12:14,484
THERE'S NOTHING ELSE
I COULD ASK FOR.

307
00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:24,328
ZIG:
SENT TO THE OFFICE ON THE FIRST
WEEK OF HIGH SCHOOL?

308
00:12:24,411 --> 00:12:27,080
MY PARENTS
ARE GONNA KILL ME.

309
00:12:27,164 --> 00:12:29,374
WELL, THIS IS MY FAULT,
YOU KNOW.

310
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:34,421
I GOT YOU ALL WRAPPED UP
IN MY JUNIOR HIGH DRAMA.

311
00:12:34,505 --> 00:12:36,715
SO, WHY DID YOU BREAK UP
WITH TORI?

312
00:12:36,798 --> 00:12:38,050
DID SHE DO SOMETHING
WRONG?

313
00:12:38,133 --> 00:12:39,760
I GUESS, I DIDN'T WANT
TO START OFF HIGH SCHOOL

314
00:12:39,843 --> 00:12:42,179
WITH A GIRLFRIEND.

315
00:12:42,262 --> 00:12:44,056
I WANTED TO KEEP
MY OPTIONS OPEN.

316
00:12:44,139 --> 00:12:46,308
IN CASE I MET SOMEONE COOL.

317
00:12:46,391 --> 00:12:48,894
THAT'S GOOD.
THAT'S REALLY GOOD.

318
00:12:51,355 --> 00:12:53,565
BUT I CAN'T TELL TORI THAT.

319
00:12:54,566 --> 00:12:55,901
WHY WOULD YOU?

320
00:12:55,984 --> 00:12:58,362
SHE ASKED ME TO FIND OUT WHAT
WENT WRONG IN YOUR RELATIONSHIP

321
00:12:58,445 --> 00:13:00,322
SO SHE CAN GET "CLOSURE".

322
00:13:00,405 --> 00:13:01,406
CLOSURE?

323
00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:03,325
PROOF THAT THE RELATIONSHIP
IS REALLY OVER

324
00:13:03,408 --> 00:13:06,578
EVEN THOUGH SHE STILL
LIKES YOU... A LOT.

325
00:13:06,662 --> 00:13:09,081
WE DID DATE FOR NEARLY
A MONTH.

326
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:13,001
AND MOST OF IT
WAS PRETTY FUN.

327
00:13:13,085 --> 00:13:14,837
MAYBE I SHOULD TALK
TO TORI INSTEAD.

328
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:16,338
REALLY?

329
00:13:16,421 --> 00:13:18,799
YEAH. IT'S THE RIGHT
THING TO DO.

330
00:13:18,882 --> 00:13:19,925
THANKS.

331
00:13:22,928 --> 00:13:24,471
SIMPSON:
HM, KATIE,

332
00:13:24,555 --> 00:13:26,515
I JUST HAD A NICE CHAT
WITH YOUR LITTLE SISTER.

333
00:13:26,598 --> 00:13:27,891
TO WHAT DO I OWE
THE PLEASURE.

334
00:13:27,975 --> 00:13:29,977
YOU TOLD US THAT IF WE KNEW
ANYTHING ABOUT THE CAFETERIA

335
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:32,145
WE SHOULD COME SEE YOU
IMMEDIATELY.

336
00:13:32,229 --> 00:13:34,022
WE KNOW IT WAS PROBABLY
HARD FOR YOU TO BELIEVE

337
00:13:34,106 --> 00:13:36,859
THAT IMOGEN DID IT
ALL ON HER OWN.

338
00:13:36,942 --> 00:13:39,152
SHE DIDN'T.
SHE HAD HELP.

339
00:13:40,153 --> 00:13:42,197
MARISOL:
WHEN FIONA TOLD US
SHE WAS THERE TOO,

340
00:13:42,281 --> 00:13:44,408
WE CONVINCED HER TO CONFESS.

341
00:13:44,491 --> 00:13:46,994
WE COULDN'T LET IMOGEN
TAKE ALL THE BLAME.

342
00:13:50,455 --> 00:13:51,748
FIONA, IS THIS TRUE?

343
00:13:52,749 --> 00:13:55,419
DID YOU SNEAK INTO THE
CAFETERIA WITH IMOGEN?

344
00:13:55,502 --> 00:13:56,879
KATIE AND MARISOL
WERE THERE TOO.

345
00:13:56,962 --> 00:13:58,547
HOW COULD YOU SAY THAT?

346
00:13:58,630 --> 00:14:00,424
WE WERE AT MARISOL'S HOUSE.

347
00:14:00,507 --> 00:14:01,758
AT LEAST TWENTY PEOPLE
CAN VERIFY THAT.

348
00:14:01,842 --> 00:14:05,053
INCLUDING MARISOL'S MOM
AND DAD.

349
00:14:05,137 --> 00:14:07,347
FIONA, DO YOU HAVE ANY PROOF
TO BACK UP YOUR ACCUSATIONS?

350
00:14:07,431 --> 00:14:08,515
NO, BUT...

351
00:14:08,599 --> 00:14:10,726
LADIES, COULD YOU GIVE US
A MOMENT ALONE PLEASE?

352
00:14:11,727 --> 00:14:13,812
SURE. IF YOU NEED
ANYTHING ELSE...

353
00:14:13,896 --> 00:14:15,647
I KNOW WHERE TO FIND YOU.

354
00:14:21,653 --> 00:14:23,739
SIR, I KNOW THIS LOOKS BAD
BUT I CAN EXPLAIN.

355
00:14:23,822 --> 00:14:25,407
FIONA, I THOUGHT THIS YEAR
WAS GONNA BE DIFFERENT.

356
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:27,534
I'VE CHANGED, MR. SIMPSON,
I PROMISE.

357
00:14:27,618 --> 00:14:30,120
THAT'S NOT WHAT IT LOOKS
LIKE FROM HERE.

358
00:14:30,204 --> 00:14:31,205
(SIGHS)

359
00:14:36,668 --> 00:14:38,837
HEY,
SORRY I'M LATE.

360
00:14:40,339 --> 00:14:43,300
I THOUGHT YOU WERE
STANDING ME UP.

361
00:14:44,718 --> 00:14:47,763
OH NO, WAS TALKING
TO TORI TERRIBLE?

362
00:14:47,846 --> 00:14:49,723
NO, NO...
IT WAS GREAT.

363
00:14:50,724 --> 00:14:52,267
SO EVERYTHING IS
WORKED OUT?

364
00:14:52,351 --> 00:14:55,354
TORI GOT HER,
"LIKE, CLOSURE"?

365
00:14:55,437 --> 00:14:56,396
ZIG:
SORT OF.

366
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:59,691
I GUESS, SOME OF THE STUFF
THAT YOU SAID,

367
00:14:59,775 --> 00:15:00,567
IT KIND OF MADE ME REALIZE

368
00:15:00,651 --> 00:15:05,030
THAT THERE'S NO GOOD REASON
TORI AND I BROKE UP.

369
00:15:05,113 --> 00:15:07,324
I GUESS WHAT
I'M SAYING IS THAT-

370
00:15:07,407 --> 00:15:08,992
YOU GUYS GOT
BACK TOGETHER?!

371
00:15:09,076 --> 00:15:10,118
HOPE YOU'RE NOT MAD.

372
00:15:10,202 --> 00:15:12,371
MAD?
WHY WOULD I BE MAD?

373
00:15:13,372 --> 00:15:16,375
WELL, TORI KINDA THINKS
YOU'RE INTO ME.

374
00:15:16,458 --> 00:15:18,710
SHE THINKS I'M INTO YOU?

375
00:15:18,794 --> 00:15:20,671
THAT'S HILARIOUS!

376
00:15:20,754 --> 00:15:21,755
TORI:
MAYA!

377
00:15:22,798 --> 00:15:24,925
CAN YOU BELIEVE HOW WELL
EVERYTHING WORKED OUT?

378
00:15:25,008 --> 00:15:26,468
NEARLY LIKE
YOU PLANNED IT.

379
00:15:26,552 --> 00:15:29,346
OH, PLEASE!
AS IF I'M THAT SMART!

380
00:15:29,429 --> 00:15:31,515
WE'RE GONNA HAVE
SO MUCH FUN THIS YEAR.

NOW HE HAS PLANS
WITH HIS GIRLFRIEND, TORI.

405
00:17:10,656 --> 00:17:11,990
I DIDN'T REALIZE
HOW MUCH I LIKED HIM

406
00:17:12,074 --> 00:17:13,951
UNTIL IT WAS TOO LATE.

407
00:17:14,034 --> 00:17:15,369
AW, MAYA, I'M SORRY.

408
00:17:15,452 --> 00:17:16,954
ARE YOU OKAY?

409
00:17:17,037 --> 00:17:19,331
IS HIGH SCHOOL ALWAYS
THIS COMPLICATED?

410
00:17:19,414 --> 00:17:20,666
AT LEAST.

411
00:17:21,792 --> 00:17:23,126
REAL NICE.

412
00:17:23,210 --> 00:17:25,712
I THOUGHT WE WERE FRIENDS.

413
00:17:25,796 --> 00:17:27,923
MAYA, I'LL MEET YOU
AT MARISOL'S CAR, OKAY?

414
00:17:28,006 --> 00:17:29,424
MAYA:
OKAY.

I'M SUSPENDED FOR A WEEK.

416
00:17:32,469 --> 00:17:33,929
ON PROBATION INDEFINITELY.

417
00:17:34,012 --> 00:17:35,430
AND I HAVE TO SPEND
MY ENTIRE WEEKEND HERE

418
00:17:35,514 --> 00:17:37,015
CLEANING THE CAFETERIA.

419
00:17:37,099 --> 00:17:39,768
I'M SORRY, FIONA,
I KNOW IT SUCKS,

420
00:17:39,852 --> 00:17:42,604
BUT WE STILL NEED A CHAIR
FOR THE SOCIAL COMMITTEE.

421
00:17:42,688 --> 00:17:43,772
YOU'RE KIDDING, RIGHT?

422
00:17:43,856 --> 00:17:45,399
I STILL WANT TO BE FRIENDS.

423
00:17:45,482 --> 00:17:46,608
WE WERE NEVER FRIENDS.

424
00:17:46,692 --> 00:17:48,235
FRIENDS DON'T DO THIS
TO EACH OTHER.

425
00:17:48,318 --> 00:17:49,653

I'M SORRY...

426
00:17:49,736 --> 00:17:52,531

OF YOU, KATIE.

00:18:10,507 --> 00:18:14,178
SO BIG PLANS FOR THIS
SUNNY SATURDAY?

430
00:18:14,428 --> 00:18:16,930
NO. I WAS PLANNING
TO DO SOME HOMEWORK.

431
00:18:17,014 --> 00:18:17,973
AND THEN SPEND
A COUPLE OF HOURS

432
00:18:18,056 --> 00:18:20,809
WONDERING WHY MY BOYFRIEND
REJECTED ME.

433
00:18:22,394 --> 00:18:24,229
I'M SORRY, OKAY?

434
00:18:27,149 --> 00:18:28,734
NO, NOT OKAY.

435
00:18:29,735 --> 00:18:31,195
YOU DON'T GET T RUN OFF
AND THEN APOLOGIZE.

436
00:18:31,278 --> 00:18:32,613
NOT AGAIN.

437
00:18:34,198 --> 00:18:35,282
DID I DO SOMETHING
WRONG?

438
00:18:35,365 --> 00:18:36,366
NO.

439
00:18:37,367 --> 00:18:38,535
THEN WHAT?

440
00:18:40,412 --> 00:18:41,955
I DON'T THINK-

441
00:18:42,039 --> 00:18:44,208
I DON'T THINK WE'LL
BE TOGETHER FOREVER.

442
00:18:44,291 --> 00:18:45,542
I KNOW THERE'S A CHANCE
WE'LL BREAK UP-

443
00:18:45,626 --> 00:18:47,461
THERE'S MORE THAN
A CHANCE.

444
00:18:47,544 --> 00:18:50,797
WITH OUR PARENTS MARRIED,
WE'RE LINKED FOR LIFE.

445
00:18:50,881 --> 00:18:52,216
HAVING SEX WOULD JUST
COMPLICATE THINGS.

446
00:18:52,299 --> 00:18:53,300
A LOT.

00:18:55,886 --> 00:18:56,887

448
00:18:57,888 --> 00:19:00,557
I THINK
WE SHOULD BREAK UP.

449
00:19:01,683 --> 00:19:04,520
IF IT'S GONNA HAPPEN,
WHY WAIT, RIGHT?

HEY GUYS.

451
00:19:08,690 --> 00:19:11,193

CHECK OUT THE FARMER'S MARKET.

YEAH, WE THOUGHT YOU MIGHT
WANNA JOIN US.

453
00:19:12,402 --> 00:19:15,572

I DON'T HAVE HOLLY J

464
00:20:15,424 --> 00:20:18,010
TO FIX EVERYTHING FOR ME.

465
00:20:18,093 --> 00:20:20,679

I DON'T HAVE ANYBODY.

I KNOW IT DOESN'T MAKE UP
FOR IT,

467
00:20:25,475 --> 00:20:28,478
BUT I DID MANAGE TO GET YOUR
SUSPENSION REDUCED.

468
00:20:30,814 --> 00:20:32,900
I'M REALLY SORRY,

CAN WE?

474
