TO FLIP YOUR OPPONENT.

182
00:06:59,336 --> 00:07:00,546
READY?

183
00:07:00,629 --> 00:07:02,422
THREE, TWO, ONE...

184
00:07:02,506 --> 00:07:03,507
GO!

185
00:07:09,054 --> 00:07:10,055
(GRUNTING)

186
00:07:14,101 --> 00:07:15,018
MATCH TO MO.

187
00:07:15,102 --> 00:07:16,520
SPECTATORS:
(APPLAUD)

188
00:07:16,603 --> 00:07:17,855
MO:
COME ON, COACH.
AGAIN?

189
00:07:17,938 --> 00:07:19,064
GIVE ME A CHALLENGE!

190
00:07:19,147 --> 00:07:22,693
ARMSTRONG:
WE'RE GONNA KEEP GOING
UNTIL SOMEBODY BEATS YOU.

191
00:07:22,776 --> 00:07:23,819
ANYONE?

192
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:27,197
MR. TORRES?

193
00:07:27,281 --> 00:07:29,533
HOW WOULD YOU LIKE TO ADD
ANOTHER SPORT TO YOUR RESUME?

194
00:07:30,617 --> 00:07:33,370
(LAUGHS) NO THANKS, SIR.
I'LL PASS.

195
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:34,705
ALL RIGHT.

196
00:07:34,788 --> 00:07:35,873
WELL, IF ANY OF YOU
ARE INTERESTED

197
00:07:35,956 --> 00:07:37,791
IN NEXT SEASON'S TRYOUTS,

198
00:07:37,875 --> 00:07:39,376
COME SEE ME.

199
00:07:48,594 --> 00:07:52,097
SO, UH, WHAT ARE YOU?
LIKE A HEAVYWEIGHT?

200
00:07:52,181 --> 00:07:54,057
YOU MAKING FUN OF ME?

201
00:07:54,141 --> 00:07:55,392
I'M WORKING ON IT!

202
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:57,102
NO, MAN.
I'M JUST SAYIN',

203
00:07:57,186 --> 00:07:59,396
YOU'RE LIKE IN A LEAGUE
OF YOUR OWN.

204
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:01,231
YOU GONNA TRY OUT?

205
00:08:01,315 --> 00:08:03,901
NAH.
I'M MORE OF AN MMA GUY.

206
00:08:03,984 --> 00:08:04,902
OH YEAH.

207
00:08:04,985 --> 00:08:07,070
TITO ORTIZ
IS THE MAN.

208
00:08:07,154 --> 00:08:09,907
HE'S A MAN,
BUT IT'S ALL ABOUT GSP!

209
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:11,825
GEORGE ST. PIERRE?

210
00:08:11,909 --> 00:08:13,243
OVERRATED!

211
00:08:16,413 --> 00:08:17,331
OKAY.

212
00:08:17,414 --> 00:08:19,750
SO WHAT DO YOU SAY
WE SETTLE THE MATTER,

213
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:21,460
HAND TO HAND?

214
00:08:22,753 --> 00:08:24,046
WHEN AND WHERE?

215
00:08:24,129 --> 00:08:25,631
(BELL RINGS)

216
00:08:31,094 --> 00:08:34,056
SORRY OUR DATE WAS SO SPEEDY
LAST NIGHT.

217
00:08:34,139 --> 00:08:35,057
A LITTLE ALLI
AND ICE CREAM

218
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:36,225
IS BETTER THAN
NO ALLI AND ICE CREAM.

219
00:08:36,308 --> 00:08:37,434
MR. BETENKAMP:
DAVE T.

220
00:08:37,518 --> 00:08:38,977
YOU FINALLY WATCH
THE ORIGINAL TRON?

221
00:08:39,061 --> 00:08:40,604
I DID, I DID.
I HAVE THOUGHTS, MR B.

222
00:08:40,687 --> 00:08:42,064
WE'LL TALK LATER?
YOU KNOW IT!

223
00:08:42,147 --> 00:08:43,357
OKAY, ALL RIGHT!

224
00:08:44,358 --> 00:08:45,859
WHAT, ARE YOU FRIENDS
WITH EVERY TEACHER?

225
00:08:45,943 --> 00:08:46,860
I'M GOOD WITH ADULTS,

226
00:08:46,944 --> 00:08:48,403
LIKE YOU ARE
WITH ADVANCED SCIENCE.

227
00:08:48,487 --> 00:08:49,404
SEE YOU AFTER CLASS?

228
00:08:49,488 --> 00:08:50,489
YEAH.

229
00:08:55,661 --> 00:08:58,080
IF MY PARENTS ASK,
I WAS WITH YOU LAST NIGHT.

230
00:08:58,163 --> 00:09:01,542
HASHTAG: DAUGHTER-OF-STRICT-
PARENT-DILEMMAS.

231
00:09:01,625 --> 00:09:03,877
WHAT HAPPENED
TO ABOVE-BOARD BHANDARI?!

232
00:09:03,961 --> 00:09:05,128
SHE CHICKENED OUT!

233
00:09:05,212 --> 00:09:07,422
BOYFRIENDS ARE FORBIDDEN,
NON-NEGOTIABLE.

234
00:09:07,506 --> 00:09:09,174
BUT YOUR PARENTS
HAVE COME SO FAR.

235
00:09:09,258 --> 00:09:10,259
AND THAT'S JUST IT.

236
00:09:10,342 --> 00:09:12,594
WE LAUGH,
THEY'RE PROUD OF ME.

237
00:09:12,678 --> 00:09:14,012
I DON'T WANNA HAVE TO GO BACK
TO SQUARE ONE.

238
00:09:14,096 --> 00:09:16,807
IT'S JUST I DON'T WANNA
HAVE TO LIE TO THEM ANYMORE.

239
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:19,977
OKAY, LET ME BLOW YOUR MIND HERE
FOR A SECOND.

240
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:22,521
WHAT IF YOU INVITED DAVE
OVER TO YOUR PLACE,

241
00:09:22,604 --> 00:09:24,314
INTRODUCE HIM
AS YOUR FRIEND,

242
00:09:24,398 --> 00:09:26,149
AND THEN, ONCE YOUR
PARENTS LIKE HIM,

243
00:09:26,233 --> 00:09:27,734
YOU PULL BACK THE CURTAIN.

244
00:09:27,818 --> 00:09:29,736
THE BOYFRIEND REVEAL.

245
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:31,822
THAT MIGHT BE AN EXPERIMENT
WORTH TRYING.

246
00:09:33,365 --> 00:09:36,159
MO:
YOU SURE YOU KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE GETTING YOURSELF INTO?

247
00:09:36,243 --> 00:09:37,786
DREW:
I COULD SAY THE SAME FOR YOU.

248
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:46,461
YOU GOTTA WATCH
THE HANDS.

249
00:09:46,545 --> 00:09:48,172
MO:
OH, YOU WANNA PLAY
LIKE THAT, EH?

250
00:09:48,255 --> 00:09:49,256

251
00:09:50,507 --> 00:09:51,508

252
00:09:54,219 --> 00:09:55,220
(GRUNTING)

253
00:09:59,766 --> 00:10:01,977
MO:
ARRGH!
ALL RIGHT! ENOUGH!

254
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:03,061
GSP'S NOT OVERRATED!

255
00:10:03,145 --> 00:10:04,813
THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT!

256
00:10:04,897 --> 00:10:06,106

IT'S ALWAYS GOOD
TO GET A JOLT OF CAFFEINE

262
00:10:19,161 --> 00:10:21,038
BEFORE THE SCHOOL
DROP OFF.

263
00:10:21,121 --> 00:10:22,789
YOU'RE NOT HAVING ONE?

264
00:10:22,873 --> 00:10:24,958
NO, I NEED TO WATCH

272
00:10:45,687 --> 00:10:48,065
I KNOW I ASKED A LOT,
BUT-

273
00:10:48,148 --> 00:10:49,441
NO, IT'S NOT THE MONEY,

274
00:10:49,525 --> 00:10:52,152
IT'S UM...
IT'S ILLEGAL.

275
00:10:53,153 --> 00:10:56,406
BUT IT'S NOT AGAINST THE LAW
IF YOU DONATE IT.

280
00:11:10,003 --> 00:11:12,631
I'M AT WORK

281
00:11:12,714 --> 00:11:14,466
OKAY, I'M ASKING THE WORLD,
I KNOW.

282
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:16,802

THREE MONTHS TO RECOVER

284
00:11:19,263 --> 00:11:21,014

285
00:11:21,098 --> 00:11:22,432
I'M A SINGLE MOM.

286
00:11:23,433 --> 00:11:24,977
YOU'D BE GIVING ME
MY LIFE.

287
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:28,146
I CAN'T AFFORD TO TAKE
THAT KIND OF TIME OFF WORK.

288
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:30,941

00:11:31,024 --> 00:11:32,860
YOU UNDERSTAND,
RIGHT?

290
00:11:34,069 --> 00:11:36,071
I UNDERSTAND THAT
YOU'RE SO SELFISH

291
00:11:36,154 --> 00:11:38,782
YOU'LL LITERALLY GIVE UP
A BABY WITHOUT A THOUGHT.

292
00:11:38,866 --> 00:11:40,242
AND THEN WHEN YOU CAN
SAVE HER LIFE...

293
00:11:40,325 --> 00:11:41,326
HOLLY J, PLEASE!

294
00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:42,911

NOT MUCH, KATIE.

307
00:12:07,144 --> 00:12:10,480
I SAW YOUR LITTLE DISAGREEMENT
ABOUT GSP WITH MO.

308
00:12:10,564 --> 00:12:11,481
GLAD TO KNOW YOU'RE A FAN.

309
00:12:11,565 --> 00:12:13,817
SO, YOU GONNA RUN
AND TELL ARMSTRONG AGAIN?

310
00:12:13,901 --> 00:12:15,694
FOR THE RECORD?
THAT WASN'T ME.

311
00:12:15,777 --> 00:12:17,988
I SWORE OFF TATTLE-TALING
IN KINDERGARTEN.

312
00:12:18,071 --> 00:12:20,449
I JUST WANT TO ASK
YOU SOMETHING.

313
00:12:20,532 --> 00:12:23,452
IN THAT CASE,
YES, I AM FREE FOR PROM.

314
00:12:24,453 --> 00:12:25,871
SO WHAT DO YOU
GET OUT OF IT?

315
00:12:25,954 --> 00:12:28,790
I MEAN, DO YOU LIKE HURTING
PEOPLE OR SOMETHING?

316
00:12:28,874 --> 00:12:30,626
DREW:
IT'S NOT ABOUT
HURTING ANYONE.

317
00:12:30,709 --> 00:12:32,252
ME AND THE GUYS
DO A LOT OF SPORTS.

318
00:12:32,336 --> 00:12:36,048
MOST SPORTS DON'T INVOLVE
WAILING ON EACH OTHER.

319
00:12:36,131 --> 00:12:37,633
'KAY, WAIT.
WHY DO YOU CARE?

320
00:12:37,716 --> 00:12:38,634
I'M WRITING SOMETHING
FOR THE PAPER

321
00:12:38,717 --> 00:12:39,885
ON VIOLENCE
IN YOUTH CULTURE.

322
00:12:39,968 --> 00:12:41,136
WHAT? NO.
YOU CAN'T-

323
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:43,722
DON'T WORRY,
IT'S ANONYMOUS.

324
00:12:43,805 --> 00:12:46,558
AND MAYBE
I'M A LITTLE CURIOUS...

325
00:12:46,642 --> 00:12:47,976
ABOUT YOU.

326
00:12:52,814 --> 00:12:53,732
OKAY, LOOK,

327
00:12:53,815 --> 00:12:56,610
WHEN I BEAT SOMEONE,
HAND-TO-HAND,

328
00:12:57,611 --> 00:12:59,738
I KNOW THAT I CAN SURVIVE.

329
00:12:59,821 --> 00:13:02,241
I KNOW THAT THEY HAVEN'T
COMPLETELY BEATEN ME DOWN.

330
00:13:02,324 --> 00:13:03,283
AND WHO ARE THEY?

331
00:13:03,367 --> 00:13:05,661
NOBODY.
JUST AN EXPRESSION.

332
00:13:07,287 --> 00:13:08,664
OKAY. COOL.

333
00:13:18,423 --> 00:13:20,300
OH, HEY CUTIE!

334
00:13:20,384 --> 00:13:22,427
LET ME SPRING SOMETHING
ON YOU HERE:

335
00:13:22,511 --> 00:13:25,764
HOW WOULD YOU FEEL ABOUT
MEETING MY PARENTS TONIGHT?

336
00:13:25,848 --> 00:13:26,765
COOL.

337
00:13:26,849 --> 00:13:27,766
YOU'RE GONNA BE GREAT,

338
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:28,767
YOU'VE NOTHING
TO WORRY ABOUT.

339
00:13:28,851 --> 00:13:30,102
I'M NOT WORRIED.
I'M INTO IT.

340
00:13:30,185 --> 00:13:31,144
OKAY, SO I'LL MEET YOU
AFTER SCHOOL

341
00:13:31,228 --> 00:13:32,396
FOR A QUICK PREP SESSION.

342
00:13:32,479 --> 00:13:34,481
(STUTTERS) PREP?

343
00:13:34,565 --> 00:13:35,482
YOU KNOW, THE BASICS:

344
00:13:35,566 --> 00:13:37,526
WHAT TO SAY,
WHAT NOT TO SAY.

345
00:13:37,609 --> 00:13:38,735
AM I MEETING THE QUEEN
OF ENGLAND,

346
00:13:38,819 --> 00:13:40,445
OR AM I MEETING
YOUR PARENTS?

347
00:13:40,529 --> 00:13:41,697
YOU ALREADY KNOW
MOST ADULTS LOVE ME.

348
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:43,365
MY PARENTS AREN'T
MOST ADULTS.

349
00:13:43,448 --> 00:13:44,992
LET'S JUST SAY
THEY'RE A LITTLE...

350
00:13:45,075 --> 00:13:46,410
PARTICULAR.

351
00:13:46,493 --> 00:13:48,370
BUT IF OUR MEETING
GOES WELL,

352
00:13:48,453 --> 00:13:50,956
YOU AND I GET TO HANG OUT
AT MY PLACE WHENEVER WE WANT,

353
00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:52,124
NO SNEAKING AROUND.

354
00:13:52,207 --> 00:13:53,542
ALL RIGHT.
I LIKE THE SOUND OF THAT.

355

00:20:25,267 --> 00:20:27,769
OKAY, THAT'S NOT WHAT I MEANT.
NO...

530
00:20:28,812 --> 00:20:29,563
MORE TEA?

531
00:20:29,646 --> 00:20:30,564
SORRY, I ACTUALLY
GOTTA HEAD OUT;

532
00:20:30,647 --> 00:20:32,566
MY DAD NEEDS HELP
IN THE YARD.

533
00:20:32,649 --> 00:20:34,318
MRS. BHANDARI:
OF COURSE.

534
00:20:34,401 --> 00:20:35,611
COME BACK AND VISIT AGAIN SOON.

535
00:20:35,694 --> 00:20:37,696
OKAY. ALL RIGHT.
THANK YOU.

536
00:20:40,782 --> 00:20:43,160
(KEYBOARD KEYS CLACK,
DOOR OPENS)

537
00:20:43,243 --> 00:20:44,953
DREW:
YOU LIED TO ME.

538
00:20:45,037 --> 00:20:46,205
EXCUSE ME?

539
00:20:46,288 --> 00:20:47,206
I JUST GOT OUT OF DETENTION.

540
00:20:47,289 --> 00:20:49,625
YOUR STUPID PIECE
WASN'T ANONYMOUS!

541
00:20:49,708 --> 00:20:51,168
THERE ISN'T A SINGLE
NAME IN IT.

542
00:20:51,251 --> 00:20:53,921
SORRY, BUT I'M TRYING TO FINISH
THE INTRAMURAL ROUND-UP.

543
00:20:54,004 --> 00:20:55,297
NOT A SINGLE WRITER
ON STAFF

544
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:57,758
HAS ANY INTEREST
IN SPORTS.

545
00:20:58,759 --> 00:21:00,552
SIMPSON SHUT
THE WEIGHT ROOM DOWN.

546
00:21:00,636 --> 00:21:01,553
YOU NEED TO SIGN UP

547
00:21:01,637 --> 00:21:02,846
AND HAVE A TEACHER
SUPERVISE NOW.

548
00:21:02,930 --> 00:21:04,348
SO THE PRINCIPAL
FINALLY FIGURED OUT

549
00:21:04,431 --> 00:21:06,099
WHAT'S GOING ON
IN HIS OWN SCHOOL.

550
00:21:06,183 --> 00:21:08,101
HOW IS THAT MY PROBLEM?

551
00:21:10,604 --> 00:21:12,523
I THOUGHT YOU LIKED ME.

552
00:21:17,819 --> 00:21:21,198
LOOK, I'VE HEARD STORIES
ABOUT YOU;

553
00:21:21,281 --> 00:21:22,866
RUMOURS ABOUT
WHY YOU MISSED SCHOOL

554
00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:25,035
AFTER SPRING BREAK.

555
00:21:25,118 --> 00:21:26,703
IF YOU'RE HIDING
SOMETHING,

556
00:21:26,787 --> 00:21:28,205
MAYBE I CAN HELP.

557
00:21:29,915 --> 00:21:31,333
HOW?

558
00:21:31,416 --> 00:21:34,253
BY PUTTING MY PERSONAL CRAP
IN YOUR PAPER?

559
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:35,629
WELL,
HERE'S THE STORY:

560
00:21:35,712 --> 00:21:37,714
DREW TORRES IS AN IDIOT.

561
00:21:37,798 --> 00:21:40,008
HE THOUGHT KATIE MALTIN
WAS SOMEONE HE COULD TRUST.

562
00:21:40,092 --> 00:21:41,927
(CHAIR CRASHES)

563
00:21:42,010 --> 00:21:43,011
(DOOR BANGS SHUT)
