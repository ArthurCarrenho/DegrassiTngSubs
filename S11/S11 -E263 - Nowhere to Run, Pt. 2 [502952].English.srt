00:00:04,213 --> 00:00:05,506
(SWITCH CLUNKS)

2
00:00:05,589 --> 00:00:07,132
THERE.

3
00:00:07,216 --> 00:00:08,592
I'M GONNA LOOK FOR CLARE.

4
00:00:08,675 --> 00:00:09,843
MARISOL:
WHAT IF THE POWER
GOES OUT AGAIN?

5
00:00:09,927 --> 00:00:11,303
JAKE: IT WON'T.
MARISOL: HOW DO YOU KNOW?

6
00:00:11,386 --> 00:00:13,096
CAN SOMEONE HANDLE HER?
I'M LEAVING.

7
00:00:14,681 --> 00:00:17,309
DREW:
JAKE, CLARE IS JUST BEING
A DRAMA QUEEN.

8
00:00:17,392 --> 00:00:18,894
SHE'S GONNA COME BACK, MAN.

9
00:00:18,977 --> 00:00:19,978
BIANCA:
HELLO?

10
00:00:20,062 --> 00:00:22,022
THE GIRL CAME ALL THE WAY
UP HERE FOR HER STEP-BROTHER,

11
00:00:22,105 --> 00:00:23,899
THEN FOUND HIM KISSING BANDARI.

12
00:00:23,982 --> 00:00:26,360
I WOULDN'T WANNA BE HERE EITHER.

13
00:00:26,443 --> 00:00:28,946
SHE COULDN'T HAVE GONE
TOO FAR.

14
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:30,864
THE WOODS ARE DENSE
AROUND HERE.

15
00:00:30,948 --> 00:00:31,865
IT COULD GET DANGEROUS

16
00:00:31,949 --> 00:00:32,908
IF YOU DON'T KNOW
YOUR WAY AROUND.

17
00:00:32,991 --> 00:00:34,618
'KAY, I'M COMING WITH YOU, MAN.

18
00:00:34,701 --> 00:00:36,411
ALLI: ME TOO.
JAKE: NO, NOT A GOOD IDEA.

19
00:00:36,495 --> 00:00:37,746
ALLI:
BUT SHE'S MY BEST FRIEND.

20
00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:39,748
YOU'LL JUST GET
IN THE WAY.

21
00:00:40,749 --> 00:00:42,000
BIANCA:
YOU'RE BETTER OFF HERE.

22
00:00:42,084 --> 00:00:43,126
IN HORROR MOVIES,

23
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:45,796
BAD STUFF HAPPENS TO PEOPLE
WHO GO OUT TO THE WOODS,

24
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:47,422
AND CONSIDERING
YOU'RE THE SKANKY BITCH

25
00:00:47,506 --> 00:00:48,799
IN THIS SCENARIO,

26
00:00:48,882 --> 00:00:49,883
YOU DIE FIRST.

27
00:00:51,218 --> 00:00:53,136
THIS ISN'T A STUPID MOVIE,
BIANCA!

28
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:54,972
CLARE COULD ACTUALLY
BE HURT.

29
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:57,766
OH!
AND WHOSE FAULT IS THAT?

30
00:00:58,767 --> 00:00:59,768
SCOOCH OVER.

31
00:01:01,812 --> 00:01:03,814

READY?
YEAH, LET'S GO.

33
00:01:10,904 --> 00:01:12,990

WHY WOULD SHE COME UP
HERE?

69
00:03:04,852 --> 00:03:06,144
WHY AREN'T THEY BACK YET?

70
00:03:06,228 --> 00:03:07,938
BECAUSE SOMETHING BAD
IS HAPPENING.

FUNNY,

00:03:12,693 --> 00:03:15,904
EVERYTHING YOU JUST LISTED
ALWAYS LEADS TO A MURDER.

75
00:03:15,988 --> 00:03:16,905
THAT'S IT,
I'M DRIVING HOME.

UP HERE WITH DREW.

SIT. I'LL MAKE YOU
SOME HERBAL TEA, OKAY?

86
00:03:42,764 --> 00:03:45,017

GET THAT?

YOUR STUPID PRANK!

FINE.
IT'S YOUR FUNERAL.

NOT IN HERE.

102
00:04:15,172 --> 00:04:16,298
JUST GO OUTSIDE.

OKAY, FINE.

104
00:04:22,596 --> 00:04:24,264
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

105
00:04:27,309 --> 00:04:28,352
JAKE:
I CAN'T BELIEVE CLARE
FOLLOWED ME

106
00:04:28,435 --> 00:04:29,603
ALL THE WAY HERE.

107
00:04:29,686 --> 00:04:31,271
HOW DOES SHE EXPECT ME
TO MOVE ON?

108
00:04:31,355 --> 00:04:33,065
DREW:
CLEARLY SHE DOESN'T
WANT YOU TO, BRO.

109
00:04:33,148 --> 00:04:35,734
JAKE:
JUST EARLIER TODAY
SHE SAID WE WERE "SO OVER."

110
00:04:35,817 --> 00:04:37,027
DREW:
YOU'VE MET GIRLS, RIGHT?

111
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:38,487
USUALLY WHEN THEY SAY
ONE THING

112
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:41,532
THEY MEAN
THE COMPLETE OPPOSITE.

113
00:04:41,615 --> 00:04:42,533
IF I KNEW
SHE WAS COMING UP,

114
00:04:42,616 --> 00:04:44,243
I NEVER WOULD'VE
KISSED ALLI.

115
00:04:44,326 --> 00:04:45,744
THINK SHE'LL EVER
FORGIVE ME?

116
00:04:45,827 --> 00:04:47,246
MAYBE -
IF YOU FIND HER,

117
00:04:47,329 --> 00:04:51,083
AND SAVE HER FROM
THE DARK SCARY WOODS.

118
00:04:52,793 --> 00:04:53,961
COME ON.
OH NO.

119
00:04:54,962 --> 00:04:56,755
OKAY.

120
00:04:56,839 --> 00:04:57,840
UM...

121
00:04:58,841 --> 00:05:01,176
UH, WHAT IS THAT?

122
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:03,846
IT'S UH...
IT'S CLARE'S.

123
00:05:03,929 --> 00:05:05,472
HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT?

124
00:05:05,556 --> 00:05:07,516
SHE WAS WEARING IT
WHEN SHE CAME.

125
00:05:07,599 --> 00:05:09,893
DREW:
UM, JAKE, IS THAT...?

126
00:05:09,977 --> 00:05:10,978
IT'S BLOOD.

127
00:05:13,063 --> 00:05:14,189
WHAT IF THE MURDERER
GOT HER?

128
00:05:14,273 --> 00:05:16,984
THAT WAS JUST
A STUPID STORY!

129
00:05:17,985 --> 00:05:19,486
COME ON.
NO!

130
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:22,781
CLARE!

131
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:25,826
OH MY GOD.
CLARE!

132
00:05:26,869 --> 00:05:29,663
ALL RIGHT, JAKE,
WHAT NOW?

133
00:05:29,746 --> 00:05:30,956
LET'S GO THIS WAY.
OKAY.

134
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:32,040
JAKE AND DREW:
CLARE! CLARE!

135
00:05:34,918 --> 00:05:36,587
(LATCH CLICKS,
DOOR CREAKS OPEN)

136
00:05:43,385 --> 00:05:46,221
WHAT IF SOMETHING HAPPENS
TO CLARE?

137
00:05:46,305 --> 00:05:49,474
BIANCA:
YOU'LL PROBABLY NEVER
FORGIVE YOURSELF.

138
00:05:49,558 --> 00:05:52,394
BUT HANG IN THERE,
IT GETS BETTER.

139
00:05:55,147 --> 00:05:57,024
(SIGHS) I'M NEVER LEAVING
MY HOUSE AGAIN.

140
00:05:57,107 --> 00:05:58,692
EVERY TIME I TRY TO HAVE
A LITTLE FUN,

141
00:05:58,775 --> 00:06:00,986
IT ALWAYS TURNS
INTO A DISASTER.

142
00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:03,822
EVEN FOR YOU,
KISSING JAKE WAS LOW.

143
00:06:03,906 --> 00:06:05,282
EXCUSE ME?

144
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:07,159
THIS COMING FROM
BOILER-ROOM BIANCA?

145
00:06:07,242 --> 00:06:08,285
RING A BELL?

146
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:10,621
YOU AND DREW,
MY BOYFRIEND AT THE TIME?

147
00:06:10,704 --> 00:06:12,164
THAT'S DIFFERENT.

148
00:06:12,247 --> 00:06:15,209
YOU WEREN'T
MY BEST FRIEND FOREVER.

149
00:06:16,293 --> 00:06:18,670
I'VE NEVER ROASTED
A MARSHMALLOW BEFORE.

150
00:06:18,754 --> 00:06:20,088
INTERESTED?

151
00:06:20,172 --> 00:06:21,965
(BANGING AT THE DOOR)

152
00:06:22,049 --> 00:06:23,050
ALLI:
UH...

153
00:06:27,137 --> 00:06:28,430
DON'T ANSWER.

154
00:06:28,514 --> 00:06:30,807
WHAT IF IT'S CLARE
AND JAKE?

155
00:06:30,891 --> 00:06:32,601
(POUNDING AT THE DOOR)

156
00:06:33,602 --> 00:06:36,146
THE DOOR'S UNLOCKED.

157
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:37,481
THEN WHO WOULD BE
KNOCKING?

158
00:06:39,983 --> 00:06:41,902
(TERRIFIED SCREAMS)

159
00:06:41,985 --> 00:06:43,862
(COUGHS)
WHAT WAS THAT?

160
00:06:43,946 --> 00:06:46,323
PROBABLY BIANCA
TRYING TO SCARE US.

161
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:48,116
ARE YOU DONE?
CAN WE GO BACK IN NOW?

162
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,201
WHERE THE SCREAMING'S
COMING FROM,

163
00:06:49,284 --> 00:06:51,203
AND A MURDERER
ON THE LOOSE?

164
00:06:51,286 --> 00:06:52,788
ARE YOU NUTS?

165
00:06:52,871 --> 00:06:54,164
MARE,
I NEED TO MAKE SURE

166
00:06:54,248 --> 00:06:56,542
BIANCA ISN'T LOOKING
FOR DREW.

167
00:06:56,625 --> 00:06:59,002
I SAW HER USING
HER FEMININE WILES ON HIM

168
00:06:59,086 --> 00:07:00,212
IN DREW'S HOUSE.

169
00:07:00,295 --> 00:07:01,839
FEMININE WILES...

170
00:07:01,922 --> 00:07:04,716
I'VE GOT THOSE.
(LAUGHS)

171
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,176
WHAT IF SOMETHING HAPPENED
WHILE I WAS AWAY

172
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:07,261
AT OUR SOCCER TOURNAMENT?

173
00:07:07,344 --> 00:07:10,848
YOU THINK DREW
AND BIANCA SEXED?

174
00:07:10,931 --> 00:07:13,016
NOW WHO'S PARANOID?

175
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:15,519
YOU'RE A TERRIBLE FRIEND
WHEN YOU'RE HIGH.

176
00:07:15,602 --> 00:07:17,187
I'M GONNA GIVE BIANCA
A PIECE OF MY MIND;

177
00:07:17,271 --> 00:07:19,314
FIND OUT THE TRUTH.

178
00:07:22,192 --> 00:07:24,027
IT'S LOCKED.

179
00:07:24,111 --> 00:07:25,904
SOMEONE LOCKED US IN.

180
00:07:25,988 --> 00:07:27,531
WHO WOULD DO THAT
TO US?

181
00:07:27,614 --> 00:07:29,283
HMM...
TAKE ONE GUESS.

182
00:07:29,366 --> 00:07:31,368
STARTS WITH A B...

183
00:07:32,369 --> 00:07:34,371
AND RHYMES WITH...

184
00:07:35,956 --> 00:07:38,709
ACTUALLY IT DOESN'T RHYME
WITH ANYTHING.

185
00:07:38,792 --> 00:07:40,377
SUCKS FOR HER.

186
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:41,461
BOTH:
(LAUGH)

187
00:07:46,967 --> 00:07:47,968
WE NEED TO FIND
A WAY OUT.

188
00:07:50,596 --> 00:07:51,930

(SHRIEKS)
LET GO OF ME! NO! HELP!

195
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:32,846
MALE:
IT'S OKAY. CALM DOWN!
IT'S ME!

196
00:08:32,930 --> 00:08:33,931
IT'S ELI!

(GASPING FOR BREATH)

198
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:38,393
WHAT'RE YOU DOING HERE?

199
00:08:38,477 --> 00:08:40,103
I'M SORRY I SCARED YOU.
I WENT TO THE CABIN

200
00:08:40,187 --> 00:08:42,606
AND ALLI AND BIANCA SAID
THAT YOU WERE MISSING.

201
00:08:42,689 --> 00:08:44,024
THEY ALSO SCREAMED
WHEN THEY SAW ME.

202
00:08:44,107 --> 00:08:46,443
WHY IS EVERYONE SO JUMPY?

203
00:08:46,527 --> 00:08:48,278
IT'S BEEN A LONG DAY.

204
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:51,031
HOW DID YOU GET HERE?

205
00:08:51,114 --> 00:08:52,199
I TOOK A BUS
TO THE NEAREST TOWN,

206
00:08:52,282 --> 00:08:53,951
THEN I BIKED THE REST.

207
00:08:54,034 --> 00:08:55,410
YOU BIKED?

208
00:08:55,494 --> 00:08:57,287
YEAH. I'VE BEEN DOING IT
ALL SUMMER.

209
00:08:57,371 --> 00:08:59,873
I PASSED BY JAKE AND THEM
AT THE DOT AND...

210
00:08:59,957 --> 00:09:01,583
WELL, I THOUGHT IT
MIGHT BE A GOOD IDEA

211
00:09:01,667 --> 00:09:02,584
TO HANG OUT
WITH SOME SENIORS

212
00:09:02,668 --> 00:09:04,795
BEFORE SCHOOL STARTS.

213
00:09:04,878 --> 00:09:07,673
SO HE INVITED EVERYONE
BUT ME.

214
00:09:08,674 --> 00:09:10,133
YOUR HAND LOOKS BAD.

215
00:09:10,217 --> 00:09:11,552
I FELL.

216
00:09:11,635 --> 00:09:14,137
HERE.
LET ME LOOK AT IT.

217
00:09:23,814 --> 00:09:26,567
KATIE: LET US OUT!

218
00:09:26,650 --> 00:09:27,734
OH, IT'S NO USE,

219
00:09:27,818 --> 00:09:30,654
WE ARE GOING TO DIE
IN HERE.

220
00:09:34,783 --> 00:09:36,159

OURSELVES OUT.

THE SECONDHAND SMOKE

222
00:09:38,453 --> 00:09:40,622
IS GETTING TO YOUR HEAD.

223
00:09:40,706 --> 00:09:41,623
WHAT DO YOU EXPECT?

224
00:09:41,707 --> 00:09:44,626
IT'S LIKE A HOT BOX
IN HERE!

225
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:45,878
IF WE DIG A HOLE
BY THE DOOR,

226
00:09:45,961 --> 00:09:48,046
WE CAN CRAWL UNDER.

227
00:09:49,798 --> 00:09:50,716
FINE.

228
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:53,552
BUT ONLY BECAUSE
I WANNA TONE MY ARMS

229
00:09:53,635 --> 00:09:55,804
FOR THE POWER SQUAD.

236
00:10:13,614 --> 00:10:14,615
BLING.

237
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:19,119
LOOK,
THEY'RE ENGRAVED.

WHAT IF THEY'RE THE PEOPLE
FROM JAKE'S STORY?

241
00:10:26,543 --> 00:10:28,504
WHAT IF THE JEALOUS KILLER'S
THE ONE WHO LOCKED US IN?

242
00:10:28,587 --> 00:10:29,838
WHAT IF HE HURT
OUR FRIENDS?

243
00:10:29,922 --> 00:10:30,839
WE'RE NEXT!

244
00:10:30,923 --> 00:10:31,924

248
00:10:41,099 --> 00:10:43,393
HERE, PUT THIS ON.

249
00:10:43,477 --> 00:10:44,561
THANKS.

250
00:10:50,359 --> 00:10:52,194
SO, DID I INTERRUPT
AN INTENSE GAME

251
00:10:52,277 --> 00:10:53,445

(SCOFFS) NO.

253
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:56,323
SO, MAY I ASK,

254
00:10:56,406 --> 00:10:57,783
WHY DID YOU RUN
INTO A DARK FOREST

255
00:10:57,866 --> 00:10:59,409
BY YOURSELF?

256
00:10:59,493 --> 00:11:01,745
LET'S JUST SAY
A CERTAIN SOMEONE MOVED ON

257
00:11:01,828 --> 00:11:03,664
BEFORE I HAD A CHANCE
TO TALK TO HIM.

258
00:11:03,747 --> 00:11:06,208
STOP! YOU'RE OVERWHELMING ME
WITH DETAILS.

259
00:11:07,751 --> 00:11:09,962
IS IT WEIRD TO BE GLAD
YOU WERE THE ONE TO FIND ME?

YOU FOUND HER.

266
00:11:21,306 --> 00:11:22,307
I DID.

267
00:11:23,934 --> 00:11:25,394
ARE YOU OKAY?

268
00:11:25,477 --> 00:11:27,437

I THINK...
I THINK HE'S GONE.

271
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:46,790
THAT'S WHAT HE WANTS US
TO THINK.

272
00:11:46,874 --> 00:11:47,791

I KNEW IT!

296
00:12:49,228 --> 00:12:50,646
YOU LOCKED US IN THERE.

UH, NO,
I WAS ROASTING MARSHMALLOWS.

298
00:12:53,148 --> 00:12:54,358
YOU'RE TRYING
TO GET RID OF ME

299
00:12:54,441 --> 00:12:56,485
SO YOU CAN HOOK UP
WITH DREW.

300
00:12:56,568 --> 00:12:57,861
WAIT.
SO YOU ACTUALLY THINK

301
00:12:57,945 --> 00:12:59,988
THAT I'M TRYING TO STEAL
DREW FROM YOU?

302
00:13:00,072 --> 00:13:01,448
WHY ELSE WOULD YOU COME
ALL THE WAY UP HERE

303
00:13:01,532 --> 00:13:04,368
AND LOCK ME IN
A TOOL SHED?

304
00:13:04,451 --> 00:13:05,619
YOU'RE RIGHT;

305
00:13:05,702 --> 00:13:07,162
WEED DOES MAKE YOU PARANOID.

306
00:13:07,246 --> 00:13:08,705
I KNOW HOW YOU WORK.

307
00:13:08,789 --> 00:13:09,790
YOU DID IT TO ALLI-

308
00:13:09,873 --> 00:13:11,166
OH, PLEASE LEAVE ME
OUT OF THIS.

309
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:14,378
AND I WON'T LET YOU
DO IT TO ME.

310
00:13:14,461 --> 00:13:17,005
I WATCH YOU, BIANCA.

311

YOU'RE ALWAYS READY
TO POUNCE.

MUST'VE BEEN A REASON.

326
00:14:10,142 --> 00:14:11,476
THERE WAS.

327
00:14:12,477 --> 00:14:13,562

REALLY?

331
00:14:18,901 --> 00:14:20,235
YEAH, AND KISSING HER BACK
WAS THE STUPIDEST THING

332
00:14:20,319 --> 00:14:22,029
I'VE EVER DONE.

333
00:14:24,489 --> 00:14:25,574
WELL, THAT SHOULD DO IT.

334
00:14:25,657 --> 00:14:26,700

00:14:31,788 --> 00:14:33,624
LOOK, I TRIED...

337
00:14:35,417 --> 00:14:38,837
I TRIED GETTING OVER YOU
ALL SUMMER

338
00:14:41,006 --> 00:14:42,758
AND I COULDN'T.

339
00:14:44,009 --> 00:14:47,429
AND WHEN I FOUND
YOUR HEAD BAND,

340
00:14:47,513 --> 00:14:50,140
I... I THOUGHT THAT SOMETHING
REALLY BAD HAPPENED

341
00:14:50,224 --> 00:14:52,142
AND I REGRETTED EVERY MINUTE
THAT I DIDN'T SPEND WITH YOU.

342
00:14:52,226 --> 00:14:53,227
STOP.

343
00:14:55,979 --> 00:14:58,690
I THOUGHT ABOUT
KISSING ELI

344
00:15:00,984 --> 00:15:03,028
TO GET BACK AT YOU.

345
00:15:06,448 --> 00:15:07,449
OH.

346
00:15:09,159 --> 00:15:10,661
LOOK, CLARE,

347
00:15:12,871 --> 00:15:15,332
I'M SORRY I RAN AWAY
ALL SUMMER -

348
00:15:15,415 --> 00:15:18,085
FROM THE WEDDING...

00:15:19,253 --> 00:15:20,879

SO? WHAT'D YOU GIRLS GET UP TO
WHILE WE WERE OUT?

353
