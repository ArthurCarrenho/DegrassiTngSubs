WHAT DO YOU EXPECT?

9
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:25,150
IT'S HARD ENOUGH ADJUSTING

10
00:00:25,234 --> 00:00:26,401
ONE OF THEM BEING
MY EX-BOYFRIEND

11
00:00:26,485 --> 00:00:28,654

HELEN:
NONSENSE!

20
00:00:43,043 --> 00:00:44,127
YOU DON'T TURN SEVENTEEN

00:13:53,083 --> 00:13:55,085
HOPE IT WASN'T TOO WEIRD,

350
00:13:55,169 --> 00:13:57,004
ME CALLING YOU
OUT OF THE BLUE?

351
00:13:57,087 --> 00:13:58,172
WELL, I HAVE TO SAY
I WAS A BIT SURPRISED

352
00:13:58,255 --> 00:14:00,007
WHEN YOU CALLED.

353
00:14:00,090 --> 00:14:01,008
BUT I'D NEVER TURN DOWN
A DINNER DATE

354
00:14:01,091 --> 00:14:02,092
WITH MY DAUGHTER.

355
00:14:02,176 --> 00:14:04,386
GOOD. WE HAVE A LOT
TO TALK ABOUT.

356
00:14:04,469 --> 00:14:07,014
YEAH.
I'M NOT SURPRISED.

357
00:14:07,097 --> 00:14:08,015
WE HAVEN'T SPENT
MUCH TIME TOGETHER

358
00:14:08,098 --> 00:14:09,266
SINCE THE DIVORCE.

359
00:14:14,062 --> 00:14:16,481
I'M JUST HAPPY
YOU AND I ARE TALKING.

360
00:14:16,565 --> 00:14:17,858
IS EVERYTHING OKAY
WITH YOU?

361
00:14:17,941 --> 00:14:19,193
HOW'S THE NEW FAMILY?

362
00:14:19,276 --> 00:14:22,654
THAT'S UH...
THAT'S ACTUALLY WHY I CALLED.

363
00:14:22,738 --> 00:14:25,365
RIGHT NOW,
I HATE BEING AT HOME.

364
00:14:25,449 --> 00:14:28,410
AND EVERYONE IS HAPPY
BUT ME.

365
00:14:29,494 --> 00:14:33,248
I COULD REALLY USE
A CHANGE OF SCENERY.

366
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,418
WITH ME?

367
00:14:38,378 --> 00:14:40,339
CLARE, MY NEW CONDO
IS REALLY SMALL.

368
00:14:40,422 --> 00:14:44,218
I'LL SLEEP ON THE SOFA,
I DON'T CARE.

369
00:14:44,301 --> 00:14:47,971
WELL, I'LL HAVE SOME
CONVINCING TO DO.

370
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:53,477
YOU'RE LIVING WITH HER?

371
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:54,770
IRENE. YEAH.

372
00:14:55,771 --> 00:14:56,939
OH.

373
00:14:57,022 --> 00:14:58,649
WITH HER KIDS
EVERY OTHER WEEK,

374
00:14:58,732 --> 00:15:00,984
THINGS GET A BIT CROWDED.

375
00:15:01,985 --> 00:15:05,656
BUT MAYBE WE COULD WORK
SOMETHING OUT.

376
00:15:06,907 --> 00:15:10,911
SO YOU STILL LIKE
CHINESE BUFFET?

377
00:15:10,994 --> 00:15:12,079
YEAH.

378
00:15:13,247 --> 00:15:14,248
SURE.

379
00:15:21,088 --> 00:15:22,297
FIONA:
HEY, CAPTAIN AMERICA.

380
00:15:22,381 --> 00:15:23,757
YOU'RE LUCKY
THIS IS ON MY ROUTE.

381
00:15:23,841 --> 00:15:24,758
WHAT'S UP?

382
00:15:24,842 --> 00:15:28,846
OH, YOU KNOW,
THIS AND THAT AND IMOGEN.

383
00:15:28,929 --> 00:15:30,264
HUH?

384
00:15:30,347 --> 00:15:32,599
YOU TWO HAVE BEEN SPENDING
A LOT OF TIME TOGETHER.

385
00:15:32,683 --> 00:15:35,269
I WONDERED IF YOU HAD
FEELINGS FOR HER?

386
00:15:35,352 --> 00:15:37,437
UH, WE'RE GOOD FRIENDS.

387
00:15:37,521 --> 00:15:38,939
THAT WASN'T THE QUESTION.

388
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:41,483
I... OKAY,

389
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:43,193
WHY ARE YOU ALL UP
IN MY BUSINESS ABOUT THIS?

390
00:15:43,277 --> 00:15:44,278
YOU DO HAVE FEELINGS
FOR HER!

391
00:15:44,361 --> 00:15:45,696
I KNEW IT!

392
00:15:45,779 --> 00:15:47,531
SO WHY THE FEET OF CLAY?

393
00:15:47,614 --> 00:15:48,615
I HURT HER,

394
00:15:48,699 --> 00:15:50,909
AND I DON'T THINK
I HAVE A SHOT.

395
00:15:50,993 --> 00:15:52,411
OF COURSE YOU DO.

396
00:15:52,494 --> 00:15:54,162
IF SHE SEEMS WARY,
IT'S CAUSE YOU'RE A BLOCKHEAD!

397
00:15:54,246 --> 00:15:55,455
THANKS.

398
00:15:55,539 --> 00:15:57,040
IMOGEN DOESN'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE THINKING.

399
00:15:57,124 --> 00:15:58,041
YOU JUST NEED TO BE DIRECT.

400
00:15:58,125 --> 00:16:00,002
I DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW
TO START THAT CONVERSATION.

401
00:16:00,085 --> 00:16:02,629
JUST LEAVE IT TO ME,
AMIGO.

402
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:06,091
WHY THE SUDDEN INTEREST
IN MATCHMAKING?

403
00:16:06,175 --> 00:16:09,595
I JUST WANT TO SEE
MY TWO BESTIES HAPPY.

404
00:16:09,678 --> 00:16:11,597
IT'S A NOBLE CAUSE!

405
00:16:12,598 --> 00:16:13,765
HEY!

406
00:16:13,849 --> 00:16:15,851
HEY, YOU'LL GET OVER IT.

407
00:16:16,894 --> 00:16:18,145

408
00:16:21,398 --> 00:16:23,650
MO:
YOU KNOW, THE ONLY THING I LIKE
BETTER THAN POWER SQUAD GIRLS?

409
00:16:23,734 --> 00:16:25,194
BAND GEEK GIRLS.

410
00:16:25,277 --> 00:16:28,697
ESPECIALLY ONES
THAT PLAY THE FRENCH HORN.

411
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:30,741
I DON'T...
I'M ONE-QUARTER FRENCH
ON MY MOM'S SIDE,

412
00:16:30,824 --> 00:16:33,410
SO...

413
00:16:33,493 --> 00:16:35,329

414
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:37,748
(LAUGHS)

415
00:16:45,547 --> 00:16:47,674
WHAT ARE YOU LAUGHING AT,
CONEHEAD?

416
00:16:47,758 --> 00:16:49,843
YOUR JOKE.
IT WAS FUNNY.

417
00:16:49,927 --> 00:16:51,011
WHAT WAS FUNNY?

418
00:16:51,094 --> 00:16:53,180
I WANT YOU AND YOUR MEGAMIND
TO DISSECT FOR ME

419
00:16:53,263 --> 00:16:54,848
WHY THAT JOKE WAS FUNNY.

420
00:16:54,932 --> 00:16:55,849
CONNOR:
I DON'T KNOW.

421
00:16:55,933 --> 00:16:57,726
I JUST LAUGHED BECAUSE
EVERYONE ELSE WAS LAUGHING;

422
00:16:57,809 --> 00:16:59,394
THAT'S WHAT I'M SUPPOSED TO DO.

423
00:16:59,478 --> 00:17:00,729
WHAT YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO?

424
00:17:00,812 --> 00:17:02,606
MO, IT'S NOT LIKE THAT.
CONNOR HAS A PROBLEM-

425
00:17:02,689 --> 00:17:03,565
NO, SHUT UP, KC!

426
00:17:03,649 --> 00:17:05,025
MY ONLY PROBLEM
IS THIS GUY!

427
00:17:05,108 --> 00:17:07,277
THEN LET ME BREAK THIS DOWN
FOR YOU IN NERD CODE.

428
00:17:07,361 --> 00:17:09,530
THINKING A JOKE IS FUNNY
EQUALS LAUGHING.

429
00:17:09,613 --> 00:17:12,199
NOT THINKING A JOKE IS FUNNY
MEANS KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT.

430
00:17:12,282 --> 00:17:13,200
GET WHAT I'M SAYING?

431
00:17:13,283 --> 00:17:14,284
I NEVER GET
WHAT YOU'RE SAYING.

432
00:17:14,368 --> 00:17:15,285
NOW YOU'RE MOCKING ME?

433
00:17:15,369 --> 00:17:16,745
I'M NOT!

434
00:17:16,828 --> 00:17:19,706
WHOA!
EASY THERE, BLIND SIDE.

435
00:17:19,790 --> 00:17:22,167
I THOUGHT I WAS
GIRL KRYPRONITE!

436
00:17:22,251 --> 00:17:23,252
(SCOFFS)

437
00:17:28,632 --> 00:17:29,633
COME ON.

438
00:17:38,934 --> 00:17:40,185
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

439
00:17:44,565 --> 00:17:45,983
WHAT IS IT?

440
00:17:47,317 --> 00:17:48,443
YOU OKAY?

441
00:17:49,444 --> 00:17:50,904
NOT REALLY.

442
00:17:50,988 --> 00:17:52,739
YOU STILL MAD
ABOUT YESTERDAY?

443
00:17:52,823 --> 00:17:54,324
YOU WERE A COMPLETE HYPOCRITE
ABOUT JENNA!

444
00:17:54,408 --> 00:17:56,243
IF I'D A BABY,
YOU'D HAVE SENT ME TO MARS!

445
00:17:56,326 --> 00:17:57,536
SHE WAS JAKE'S GUEST!

446
00:17:57,619 --> 00:17:58,871
WHAT WAS I SUPPOSED TO DO?

447
00:17:58,954 --> 00:18:00,581
AND THEN GLENN TREATS ME
LIKE SOME FOUR-YEAR-OLD.

448
00:18:00,664 --> 00:18:02,457
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU TOOK HIS SIDE.

449
00:18:02,541 --> 00:18:03,458
HE IS MY HUSBAND.

450
00:18:03,542 --> 00:18:05,419
I'M YOUR DAUGHTER!

451
00:18:07,671 --> 00:18:09,006
THERE HAVE BEEN A LOT
OF CHANGES IN THIS HOUSE,

452
00:18:09,089 --> 00:18:10,007
VERY QUICKLY.

453
00:18:10,090 --> 00:18:11,175
I KNOW YOU'RE STRUGGLING,

454
00:18:11,258 --> 00:18:13,927
BUT WE'RE IN A BETTER PLACE,
AREN'T WE?

455
00:18:14,011 --> 00:18:15,971
I NEED TO TALK
ABOUT THIS, MOM.

456
00:18:16,054 --> 00:18:16,972
I WISH I COULD HELP,

457
00:18:17,055 --> 00:18:20,017
BUT I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS
I'M SUPPOSED TO DO.

458
00:18:23,353 --> 00:18:26,064
THAT'S WHY I'M GONNA
GO STAY WITH DAD.

459
00:18:30,485 --> 00:18:31,528
RANDALL WOULD NEVER
AGREE TO THAT!

460
00:18:31,612 --> 00:18:33,947
THEN CALL HIM
AND ASK HIM,

461
00:18:34,031 --> 00:18:37,201
IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME!

462
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:42,372
THEN PLEASE CALL ME
WHEN YOU GET THERE.

463
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:53,884

468
00:19:00,224 --> 00:19:02,476
I HAD A FEELING
SHE'D COME.

469
00:19:06,396 --> 00:19:08,190
CAN I STAY?

470
00:19:08,273 --> 00:19:10,150
YES. YES, OF COURSE.

471
00:19:10,234 --> 00:19:11,235
JOIN US.

472
00:19:13,403 --> 00:19:15,155

473
00:19:15,239 --> 00:19:18,742

virgin bride ♪

474

475
00:19:25,624 --> 00:19:26,583
YOU OKAY?

476
00:19:26,667 --> 00:19:27,793
I ACTED THE WAY
I WAS SUPPOSED TO

477
00:19:27,876 --> 00:19:29,211
AND IT DIDN'T WORK.

478
00:19:29,294 --> 00:19:30,838
I DON'T KNOW WHY MO
KEEPS ON BUGGING ME.

479
00:19:30,921 --> 00:19:32,673
BECAUSE IF THEY WEREN'T
LAUGHING AT YOU,

480
00:19:32,756 --> 00:19:34,174
THEY'D BE LAUGHING
AT HIM.

481
00:19:34,258 --> 00:19:36,677
AND HE KNOWS THAT,
SO HE MAKES CONNOR JOKES.

482
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:38,804
SO WHAT IF I MADE
A MO JOKE?

483
00:19:38,887 --> 00:19:40,097
WHAT KIND OF JOKE?

484
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:41,098
WELL, MO ONLY PLAYS
FOOTBALL

485
00:19:41,181 --> 00:19:42,599
BECAUSE IT'LL HELP HIM
SCORE A GIRL.

486
00:19:42,683 --> 00:19:44,560
SO IF MO WANTS A GIRL,
I'LL GIVE HIM ONE.

487
00:19:44,643 --> 00:19:46,854
THEN HE WON'T NEED
FOOTBALL.

488
00:19:46,937 --> 00:19:49,356
THIS CONVERSATION
JUST GOT SKETCHY.

489
00:19:49,439 --> 00:19:50,732
HOW ARE YOU GONNA GIVE MO

490
00:19:50,816 --> 00:19:53,193
