1
00:00:02,169 --> 00:00:03,337
A BUH BUH BABY -

2
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:05,172
MY LITTLE BABY.

3
00:00:05,255 --> 00:00:08,217
YO MAMA'S IN THE SCHOOL
YOU'RE COVERED IN DROOL.

4
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:11,094
(LAUGHS)
HERE'S MY MAN
OF MANY TALENTS.

5
00:00:11,178 --> 00:00:13,847
WHAT'S THE SMALL FRY
DOING AT SCHOOL?

6
00:00:13,931 --> 00:00:15,390
WE KINDA NEED
TO COOL IT.

7
00:00:15,474 --> 00:00:16,725
YEAH, I KNOW.

8
00:00:16,808 --> 00:00:18,018
NOT AT SCHOOL.

9
00:00:18,101 --> 00:00:21,021
BUT WE CAN HAVE FUN
AT WORK, RIGHT?

10
00:00:22,356 --> 00:00:23,607
JENNA IS TALKING
TO SIMPSON.

11
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:26,693
SHE'S COMING BACK
TO DEGRASSI.

12
00:00:28,862 --> 00:00:32,449
SO, MEXICAN NIGHT TONIGHT
AT WORK, EH?

13
00:00:32,533 --> 00:00:33,867
WELL, I'LL BRING
MY SOMBRERO.

14
00:00:33,951 --> 00:00:34,952
'KAY.

15
00:00:37,538 --> 00:00:38,747
SO WHAT'D HE SAY?

16
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:40,457
CAN YOU COME BACK?

17
00:00:40,541 --> 00:00:42,251
(SIGHS) NO.

18
00:00:42,334 --> 00:00:44,878
I MEAN, I CAN,
IT'S JUST...

19
00:00:44,962 --> 00:00:46,630
WE HAVE NO CHILDCARE.

20
00:00:46,713 --> 00:00:48,006
SO I CAN'T.

21
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:50,133
IS THERE ANYTHING
I CAN DO?

22
00:00:50,217 --> 00:00:51,468
STAY HOME WITH TY?

23
00:00:51,552 --> 00:00:53,637
I DON'T REALLY HAVE
THE RIGHT EQUIPMENT.

24
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:55,556
DON'T CALL MY BOOBS
EQUIPMENT, KC.

25
00:00:55,639 --> 00:00:56,723
MY MOM COULD WATCH HIM?

26
00:00:56,807 --> 00:00:59,309
SHE TOLD US SHE WOULDN'T
BE A BABY-SITTER, REMEMBER?

27
00:00:59,393 --> 00:01:01,144
OKAY, WHAT ABOUT
THE MOMMIES GROUP?

28
00:01:01,228 --> 00:01:03,313
UGH, THOSE LADIES
ARE SUPER COMPETITIVE!

29
00:01:03,397 --> 00:01:04,857
IT'S SO ANNOYING.

30
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:06,817
MAYBE YOU COULD ASK THEM
HOW THEY DO IT.

31
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:08,318
FINE, I'LL ASK.

32
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:11,989
BUT ONE WAY OR ANOTHER,

33
00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:14,741
I NEED TO COME BACK
TO DEGRASSI.

51
00:02:12,549 --> 00:02:14,218
DID YOU KNOW
SHE'S A MUSICIAN?

52
00:02:14,301 --> 00:02:15,719
RUTH BADER GINSBERG?

53
00:02:15,802 --> 00:02:17,179
NO, MS. OH!

54
00:02:17,262 --> 00:02:18,972
SHE PLAYED VIOLIN
IN SOME INDIE BAND.

55
00:02:19,056 --> 00:02:20,807
THEY TOURED WITH ARCADE FIRE!

56
00:02:20,891 --> 00:02:23,227
DID YOU KNOW THIS PRESENTATION
IS DUE NEXT PERIOD?

57
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:24,728
YEAH, I KNOW, ALL I'M SAYING
IS, YOU KNOW,

58
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:27,231
SHE'S PROBABLY THE COOLEST
TEACHER, LIKE, EVER.

59
00:02:27,314 --> 00:02:31,068
DUDE, SET ASIDE YOUR TEACHER
CRUSH FOR ONE SECOND AND FOCUS!

60
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:33,946
THERE'S NO CRUSH!
I'M FOCUSED.

61
00:02:34,029 --> 00:02:34,947
SAV!

62
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:36,615
I'M SUPERVISING THE SCORE
FOR THE SCHOOL PLAY

63
00:02:36,698 --> 00:02:38,075
AND I WAS HOPING YOU'D
COME OUT FOR IT.

64
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:39,076
TODAY AT LUNCH?

65
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:41,662
SURE.
YEAH, IT'S A DATE!

66
00:02:46,834 --> 00:02:48,627
OH YEAH,
NO CRUSH AT ALL.

67
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:50,254
NO, IT'S JUST LIKE...

68
00:02:50,337 --> 00:02:51,255
YOU KNOW, I REALLY
HAVEN'T HAD ANYONE

69
00:02:51,338 --> 00:02:52,923
TO TALK MUSIC WITH
IN A WHILE.

70
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:54,675
AND SHE'D MAKE
A GREAT MENTOR!

71
00:02:54,758 --> 00:02:57,553
IS THAT WHAT THE KIDS
ARE CALLING IT THESE DAYS?

72
00:02:57,636 --> 00:02:58,720
MENTOR?

73
00:02:58,804 --> 00:03:00,305
(LAUGHS)

74
00:03:00,389 --> 00:03:02,057
ANNOUNCEMENT:
TICKETS ARE ON SALE NOW
FOR THE GRADE 11

75
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:04,393
ORIGINAL THEATRE PRODUCTION,

76
00:03:04,476 --> 00:03:05,978
BASED ON A TRUE STORY.

77
00:03:06,061 --> 00:03:07,646
WHY THANK YOU, JAKE.
YOU ARE SO-

78
00:03:07,729 --> 00:03:08,647
STRONG?

79
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:11,650
I WAS GONNA SAY
CHIVALROUS.

80
00:03:11,733 --> 00:03:14,903
SO ANY NEW IDEAS ON HOW
TO AVOID OUR PARENTS?

81
00:03:14,987 --> 00:03:16,738
WELL, I GUESS BEING IN DENIAL
THAT THEY'RE DATING

82
00:03:16,822 --> 00:03:17,948
ISN'T GOING TO MAKE IT
GO AWAY.

83
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:20,158
(GROANS)
NOT SO FAR, NO.

84
00:03:20,242 --> 00:03:21,159
(LAUGHS)

85
00:03:21,243 --> 00:03:22,953
HOW 'BOUT YOU COME OVER
AFTER SCHOOL?

86
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:26,790
MY MOM'S WORKING LATE,
WE CAN RENOVATE MY BEDROOM.

87
00:03:26,874 --> 00:03:28,083
MMM HOT.

88
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:29,459
BUT I CAN'T TONIGHT.

89
00:03:29,543 --> 00:03:31,628
NO PROBLEM! SHE WORKS
LATE ALL WEEK.

90
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:34,298
SEE THIS IS WHY I LIKE YOU
CLARE, YOU'RE SO EASY-GOING.

91
00:03:34,381 --> 00:03:35,549
I TRY.

92
00:03:35,632 --> 00:03:37,843
WHAT ARE YOU DOING TONIGHT,
ANYWAY? JUST ASKING!

93
00:03:37,926 --> 00:03:39,678
OH, I DIDN'T TELL YOU?

94
00:03:39,761 --> 00:03:42,806
I'M BUILDING THE SETS
FOR THE NEW PLAY.

95
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:44,141
THE SCHOOL PLAY?

96
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:45,851
WRITTEN BY
AND STARRING MY EX?

97
00:03:45,934 --> 00:03:48,061
ELI?
YEAH. I GUESS SO.

98
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:50,939
IS THAT ALL RIGHT?

99
00:03:51,023 --> 00:03:53,066
YEAH, YEAH.
TOTALLY.

100
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:54,193
COOL.

101
00:03:54,276 --> 00:03:55,861
YOU KNOW, I'M GLAD I FINALLY
FOUND SOMETHING I LIKE TO DO

102
00:03:55,944 --> 00:03:57,446
AT DEGRASSI.

103
00:03:58,989 --> 00:04:00,991
YOU KNOW, BESIDES YOU.

104
00:04:06,205 --> 00:04:07,206
(SIGHS)

105
00:04:09,708 --> 00:04:11,293
HE'S SO LITTLE, BUT HE'S
ALREADY OUTGROWING

106
00:04:11,376 --> 00:04:13,045
ALL HIS NEWBORN CLOTHES!

107
00:04:14,046 --> 00:04:16,006
THANK GOD MY SISTER
AND I BOTH HAD GIRLS.

108
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:18,509
HAND-ME-DOWNS ARE A SAVIOR.

109
00:04:18,592 --> 00:04:20,594
IT'S TOO BAD YOU HAD A BOY,
OR I COULD PASS IT ON.

110
00:04:20,677 --> 00:04:21,845
OH, IT'S OKAY.

111
00:04:21,929 --> 00:04:23,430
I'M A THRIFT-STORE
REGULAR.

112
00:04:23,514 --> 00:04:27,518
YEAH, YOU CAN FIND SOME GOOD
STUFF. SAVE SOME MONEY...

113
00:04:27,601 --> 00:04:29,436
SAYS THE MOM WITH
THE THOUSAND DOLLAR STROLLER.

114
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:32,189
(LAUGHS) I KNOW.
I'M THE WORST.

115
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:35,025
WHENEVER I SEE SOMETHING
I LIKE, I JUST HAVE TO BUY IT.

116
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:37,027
WHETHER IT'S A STROLLER,
TOYS, CLOTHES...

117
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:39,696
HER NANNY CAN BARELY KEEP UP
WITH THE LAUNDRY.

118
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:40,697
OH, YOU HAVE A NANNY?

119
00:04:40,781 --> 00:04:42,074
YEAH, JUST AFTERNOONS.

120
00:04:42,157 --> 00:04:43,951
WE'RE LOOKING FOR
A SHARE. SHE'S GREAT.

121
00:04:44,034 --> 00:04:45,077
FOR MORNINGS?

122
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,370
REALLY? HOW MUCH?

123
00:04:46,453 --> 00:04:48,747
ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED
A WEEK.

124
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:49,831
WHOA.

125
00:04:50,958 --> 00:04:53,794
I GUESS IT CAN ADD UP,
BUT IF YOU CAN MAKE IT WORK,

126
00:04:53,877 --> 00:04:57,840
THOSE COUPLE OF HOURS
OF ESCAPE ARE HEAVEN.

127
00:04:57,923 --> 00:04:59,925
(SIGHS)
I'M SURE THEY ARE.

128
00:05:13,981 --> 00:05:15,649
SAV!

129
00:05:15,732 --> 00:05:17,234
YOU'RE EARLY!

130
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:18,652
UH YEAH, YEAH.

131
00:05:18,735 --> 00:05:20,737
I BROUGHT MY FAVOURITE
MUSICAL SCORES-

132
00:05:20,821 --> 00:05:23,574
TRON, SOCIAL NETWORK,
THERE WILL BE BLOOD.

133
00:05:23,657 --> 00:05:24,825
SHOULD WE LISTEN?

134
00:05:24,908 --> 00:05:26,451
WE SHOULD PROBABLY
WAIT A LITTLE.

135
00:05:26,535 --> 00:05:27,452
RIGHT. YEAH.

136
00:05:27,536 --> 00:05:30,080
PROBABLY TALK MUSIC FIRST.

137
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:32,249
SO, DID YOU REALLY TOUR
WITH ARCADE FIRE?

138
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:35,502
OH, YEAH.
YOU HEARD ABOUT THAT?

139
00:05:35,586 --> 00:05:37,337
FUN TOUR.
TOUGH LIFE THOUGH.

140
00:05:37,421 --> 00:05:38,589
MMM, YEAH.

141
00:05:38,672 --> 00:05:41,800
UH, EXCUSE ME, THERE'S
A MEETING IN HERE.

142
00:05:41,884 --> 00:05:43,343
YEAH!
FOR THE PLAY'S HIT SCORE.

143
00:05:43,427 --> 00:05:46,054
BY YOURS TRULY,
MO MASHKOOOUUUUR!

144
00:05:47,055 --> 00:05:49,266
MS. OH:
OKAY, THANK-YOU
ALL FOR COMING.

145
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:51,602
AS DEGRASSI'S MOST
TALENTED MUSICIANS,

146
00:05:51,685 --> 00:05:54,271
ONE OF YOU WILL WRITE
THE SCORE TO THE PLAY.

147
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:56,315
(SNEEZING)
MO MASHKOUR.

148
00:05:58,317 --> 00:05:59,610
AND SINCE THERE'S
SO MUCH INTEREST,

149
00:05:59,693 --> 00:06:01,278
I'M MAKING IT
A COMPETITION.

150
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:02,946
AND THE WINNER WILL WORKSHOP
THE FINAL VERSION

151
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:04,698
WITH LITTLE OLD ME.

152
00:06:04,781 --> 00:06:06,950
YOU'LL ALL PRESENT YOUR
ROUGH IDEAS TOMORROW.

153
00:06:07,034 --> 00:06:07,951
IMPRESS ME!

154
00:06:08,035 --> 00:06:08,952
I WILL, MS. OH!

155
00:06:09,036 --> 00:06:10,370
(SNEEZES)
TEACHER'S PET.

156
00:06:10,454 --> 00:06:12,623
SORRY. GOT A BIT OF
A TICKLE IN MY THROAT.

157
00:06:12,706 --> 00:06:15,667
MS. OH:
NOW, SOME GUIDELINES:

158
00:06:15,751 --> 00:06:17,461
THEY WANT SOMETHING MOODY,

159
00:06:17,544 --> 00:06:18,921
HAUNTING...

160
00:06:21,548 --> 00:06:27,054
DO YOU THINK ELI WOULD SABOTAGE
MY RELATIONSHIP WITH JAKE?

161
00:06:27,137 --> 00:06:31,475
MY LIST OF THINGS ELI
WOULDN'T DO IS VERY SHORT.

162
00:06:31,558 --> 00:06:33,519
AND WHY ARE WE TALKING
ABOUT ELI AGAIN?

163
00:06:33,602 --> 00:06:35,395
ELI ASKED JAKE
TO BUILD HIS SETS.

164
00:06:35,479 --> 00:06:37,648
JAKE'S A CARPENTER, RIGHT?

165
00:06:37,731 --> 00:06:38,690
MAYBE IT'S FOR REALS.

166
00:06:38,774 --> 00:06:41,652
ELI'S TAKING THE PLAY
PRETTY SERIOUSLY.

167
00:06:41,735 --> 00:06:43,237
UH, ZINC?

168
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:45,656
JUST TELL ME
I'M BEING PARANOID.

169
00:06:45,739 --> 00:06:47,574
YOU TOTALLY ARE.

170
00:06:49,952 --> 00:06:53,747
UNLESS ELI ACTUALLY
WANTED TO POISON JAKE.

171
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:57,042
WHAT? HE POISONED FITZ
WITH IPECAC.

172
00:06:57,125 --> 00:06:58,502
I MEAN, HE'S BEEN
OFF HIS MEDS A LOT.

173
00:06:58,585 --> 00:07:00,796
BUT YOU DON'T THINK HE'D
ACTUALLY TRY AND HURT JAKE?

174
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:02,172
I'M TEASING.

175
00:07:02,256 --> 00:07:04,091

00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,492
THAT CLARA LIKES ARI.

353
00:15:09,826 --> 00:15:12,746
MAYBE SHE JUST STANDS IN
A DOORWAY, WATCHING HIM WORK.

354
00:15:12,829 --> 00:15:15,457
WHOA,
THAT'S REALLY GOOD!

355
00:15:18,335 --> 00:15:20,754
I'M GONNA LET YOU TWO TALK.

356
00:15:26,385 --> 00:15:28,971
IT'S BAD ENOUGH THAT THIS PLAY
DRAGS MY NAME THROUGH THE MUD,

357
00:15:29,054 --> 00:15:31,098
BUT CAN YOU PLEASE LEAVE
JAKE OUT OF THIS?

358
00:15:31,181 --> 00:15:32,099
JAKE?

359
00:15:32,182 --> 00:15:33,517
MY BOYFRIEND.

360
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:34,518
BUILDING YOUR SETS.

361
00:15:34,601 --> 00:15:36,019
OH JAKE.

362
00:15:36,103 --> 00:15:37,896
STRAPPING. HANDSOME.
GOOD WITH HIS HANDS.

363
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:39,523
GREAT HIRE.

364
00:15:39,606 --> 00:15:42,234
JUST PROMISE NOT TO SAY
ANYTHING MEAN ABOUT ME

365
00:15:42,317 --> 00:15:43,235
AROUND HIM.

366
00:15:43,318 --> 00:15:44,319
WHERE IS THIS VENOM
COMING FROM?

367
00:15:44,403 --> 00:15:46,405
IT'S NOT- UGH.

368
00:15:48,323 --> 00:15:50,242
YOU'RE OFF YOUR MEDS.
YOU'RE UNSTABLE.

369
00:15:50,325 --> 00:15:52,369
I'M FINE.
I'M THINKING CLEARLY.

370
00:15:52,452 --> 00:15:54,121
THEN WHY DOESN'T THAT
MAKE ME FEEL ANY BETTER?

371
00:15:54,204 --> 00:15:56,748
CLARE, I WOULD NEVER
BAD-MOUTH YOU...

372
00:15:56,832 --> 00:15:57,958
ON PURPOSE.

373
00:15:58,041 --> 00:15:59,918
BUT WHEN I'M IN HERE-

374
00:16:00,002 --> 00:16:03,630
MY CREATIVITY
CAN'T BE CONTAINED.

375
00:16:03,714 --> 00:16:06,925
DO YOU HATE ME SO MUCH YOU'D
YOU'D RUIN MY RELATIONSHIP?

376
00:16:07,009 --> 00:16:08,510
CLAIRE,
I DON'T HATE YOU.

377
00:16:08,594 --> 00:16:09,636
I JUST DON'T KNOW WHY
YOU'RE SO UPSET.

378
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:10,804
HE'LL BE OUT OF THE PICTURE
SOON ENOUGH.

379
00:16:10,888 --> 00:16:13,182
WAIT.
OUT OF THE PICTURE?

380
00:16:13,265 --> 00:16:14,725
WHAT IS THAT SUPPOSED
TO MEAN?

381
00:16:14,808 --> 00:16:18,812
(LAUGHS) OH CLARE,
ALWAYS SO CURIOUS...

382
00:16:18,896 --> 00:16:19,897

383
00:16:25,152 --> 00:16:26,153

386
00:16:34,119 --> 00:16:35,871
HEY!

387
00:16:35,954 --> 00:16:37,873
I'VE HEARD YOU'VE GOT A...
THING?

388
00:16:37,956 --> 00:16:39,791
JENNA!
THANK GOD YOU'RE HERE.

389
00:16:39,875 --> 00:16:41,543
I HAVE TO WRITE A SONG
FOR THE SCHOOL PLAY

390
00:16:41,627 --> 00:16:42,836
AND IT'S KILLING ME.

391
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:45,130
OKAY. WHAT DO YOU
HAVE SO FAR?

392
00:16:45,214 --> 00:16:46,507
UH, OKAY.

393
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:51,970
HM HM HM HM HM HM HM
HUNTER'S KNIFE.

394
00:16:54,890 --> 00:16:57,768
UM, ISN'T THAT
ROW ROW ROW YOUR BOAT?

395
00:16:57,851 --> 00:17:02,064
YES! I'VE ALSO WRITTEN YMCA,
AND THE NATIONAL ANTHEM.

396
00:17:02,147 --> 00:17:04,650
(LAUGHS)
YOU DO NEED MY HELP.

397
00:17:04,733 --> 00:17:06,360
CAN YOU COME AND JAM
IN THE MUSIC ROOM?

398
00:17:06,443 --> 00:17:07,361
NOW?

399
00:17:07,444 --> 00:17:09,738
YEAH, UNLESS YOU HAVE
TO GET BACK TO THE BABY.

400
00:17:09,821 --> 00:17:10,739
UH, NO.

401
00:17:10,822 --> 00:17:12,407
I'LL CHECK IN
WITH GRANDMA.

402
00:17:12,491 --> 00:17:14,952
I'M SURE SHE WOULDN'T MIND
WATCHING HIM A LITTLE LONGER.

403
00:17:15,035 --> 00:17:16,203
PERFECT!

404
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:29,508
WORKS ALONE, MY ASS.

405
00:17:30,425 --> 00:17:34,054
OH SAV, YOU REALLY SHOULD NOT
LEAVE YOUR THINGS UNATTENDED.

406
00:17:41,144 --> 00:17:42,479
THERE'S HIS BAG.

407
00:17:44,314 --> 00:17:46,692
YOU'RE SERIOUSLY GONNA
GO THROUGH HIS STUFF.

408
00:17:46,775 --> 00:17:48,026
HE'S BEEN OKAY LATELY.

409
00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:49,152
I KNOW HE'S UP TO SOMETHING

410
00:17:49,236 --> 00:17:50,362
I JUST DON'T HAVE ANY PROOF.

411
00:17:50,445 --> 00:17:52,239
ADAM:
WELL, IF YOU'RE SO WORRIED,
TALK TO DAWES OR SOMETHING.

412
00:17:52,322 --> 00:17:53,365

416
00:17:59,955 --> 00:18:01,540
JAKE:
HEY CLARE!

417
00:18:01,623 --> 00:18:03,375

00:18:03,458 --> 00:18:05,586
JAKE?
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

419
00:18:05,669 --> 00:18:08,380
ELI ASKED ME TO HANG
SOME LIGHTS.

420
00:18:08,463 --> 00:18:10,716
DON'T YOU THINK THAT STUFF
SHOULD BE SECURED?

421
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:12,217
NAW, IT'S STURDY.

422
00:18:15,637 --> 00:18:16,555
HOW ABOUT I HOLD IT STEADY,

423
00:18:16,638 --> 00:18:19,892
AND YOU BE A LITTLE
MORE CAREFUL, OKAY?

424
00:18:20,517 --> 00:18:22,936
THINK I'M BEING
PARANOID NOW?

LITTLE MISS STEAK'S LANDLINE

468
00:20:41,325 --> 00:20:42,951
TO REACH YOU?
I'VE BEEN HERE AN HOUR!

469
00:20:43,035 --> 00:20:46,079
I WAS BUSSING TABLES,
I DIDN'T HEAR MY PHONE BUZZ.

WHAT DID YOU DO,
ANYWAY?

IT WAS AN ACCIDENT!

00:20:48,707 --> 00:20:49,875
HE WAS ON THE CHANGE TABLE,
AND THEN-

473
00:20:49,958 --> 00:20:52,294
THEN YOU ACCIDENTALLY
DROPPED HIM ON HIS HEAD?!

474
00:20:52,377 --> 00:20:53,337
WERE YOU EVEN PAYING
ATTENTION?

475
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:55,964
DO NOT ACCUSE ME
OF BEING A BAD MOTHER!

WHILE YOU'RE OFF HAVING FUN.

FUN? I WORK!

478
00:21:01,345 --> 00:21:02,471

00:21:02,554 --> 00:21:05,599
ARE YOU SAYING IT'S NOT WORK
TO STAY HOME WITH THE BABY?!

480
00:21:05,682 --> 00:21:07,142
I DON'T KNOW, BUT IT MUST
BE NICE TO SIT AT HOME,

481
00:21:07,226 --> 00:21:09,311
WATCH TV AND PLAY GUITAR,

482
00:21:09,394 --> 00:21:11,230

A TABLE!

483
00:21:11,313 --> 00:21:12,481
YOU'RE SUCH AN ASS!

484
00:21:12,564 --> 00:21:13,649
EXCUSE ME?

485
00:21:13,732 --> 00:21:15,692
GOOD NEWS.
TY'S GOING TO BE OKAY.

486
00:21:15,776 --> 00:21:17,110
OH THANK GOODNESS.

487
00:21:17,194 --> 00:21:18,612
NURSE:
HE PASSED ALL THE TESTS,

488
00:21:18,695 --> 00:21:20,322
BUT HE MAY STILL
HAVE A CONCUSSION,

489
00:21:20,405 --> 00:21:22,824
SO YOU'LL HAVE
TO MONITOR HIM.

490
00:21:22,908 --> 00:21:24,326
WE CAN DO THAT.

491
00:21:24,409 --> 00:21:25,536
THERE IS ONE OTHER THING.

492
00:21:25,619 --> 00:21:27,120
OH GOD. WHAT?

493
00:21:28,121 --> 00:21:30,791
GIVEN THE NATURE OF YOUR
BABY'S INJURIES AND YOUR...

494
00:21:30,874 --> 00:21:32,167
...SITUATION,

495
00:21:32,251 --> 00:21:34,795
I HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO FILE
A REPORT TO CHILD SERVICES.

496
00:21:34,878 --> 00:21:37,005
BUT WE DIDN'T DO ANYTHING
WRONG. IT WAS AN ACCIDENT.

497
00:21:37,089 --> 00:21:38,757
I'M SORRY.
THAT'S POLICY.
