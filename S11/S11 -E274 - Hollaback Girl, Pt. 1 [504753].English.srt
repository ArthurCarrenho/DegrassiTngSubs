I CAN SEE
WHY YOU'RE UPSET.

153
00:06:34,311 --> 00:06:35,479
SOMETIMES SHE ACTS
REALLY WEIRD

154
00:06:35,562 --> 00:06:36,522
AROUND OTHER PEOPLE.

155
00:06:36,605 --> 00:06:38,857
LIKE WE WERE HOLDING HANDS
IN THE HALL THE OTHER DAY,

156
00:06:38,941 --> 00:06:39,858
AND PEOPLE SAW US

157
00:06:39,942 --> 00:06:41,485
AND SHE DROPPED MINE
LIKE A HOT POTATO.

158
00:06:41,568 --> 00:06:42,611
THEN SHE WENT ON TO SAY,

159
00:06:42,694 --> 00:06:45,113
THAT WE'RE NOT "OFFICIAL"
OFFICIAL.

160
00:06:45,197 --> 00:06:46,740

NO.

166
00:07:00,921 --> 00:07:02,923
TAKE HER OUT,
MAKE IT OFFICIAL...

167
00:07:03,006 --> 00:07:05,259

I LOVE SURPRISES.

367
00:15:18,377 --> 00:15:19,795
BUT IF I DON'T KNOW
WHAT IT IS,

368
00:15:19,878 --> 00:15:22,047
HOW DO I KNOW
WHAT TO WEAR?

369

WHAT SHOULD I DO?

NO. I'M NOT TOUCHING
THAT ONE.

ADVICE RIGHT NOW.

WHY NOT?

473
00:20:24,933 --> 00:20:26,685
BECAUSE MY HONEST ADVICE

474
00:20:26,768 --> 00:20:27,936
WOULD PROBABLY BE
SOMETHING LIKE,

475
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:29,354
IF YOU'RE THAT MISERABLE

476
00:20:29,438 --> 00:20:30,355
YOU SHOULD BREAK UP
WITH HER

477
00:20:30,439 --> 00:20:31,607
AND BE WITH ME...

478
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:39,364
AND THAT WOULD BE
A REALLY STUPID THING TO SAY.

479
00:20:39,448 --> 00:20:41,658
YOU'RE JOKING, RIGHT?

480

EVER HAPPENED, PLEASE?

NO.

489
00:21:12,606 --> 00:21:14,608
NO, BECAUSE I FEEL
THE SAME WAY ABOUT YOU.

490
00:21:14,691 --> 00:21:15,692
SHUT UP.

492
00:21:23,867 --> 00:21:24,826
ARE YOU TRYING
TO PUSH MY BUTTONS?
