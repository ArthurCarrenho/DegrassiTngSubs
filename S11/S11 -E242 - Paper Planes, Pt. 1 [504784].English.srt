00:06:36,897 --> 00:06:38,482
I PROMISE.
WHAT'S UP?

179
00:06:38,565 --> 00:06:41,568
OKAY, YOU MIGHT
WANT TO SIT DOWN.

180
00:06:42,569 --> 00:06:43,904
UM...

181
00:06:45,155 --> 00:06:47,324
LAST NIGHT
I TRIED COCAINE.

182
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:48,408
ANYA!

183
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:51,828
I MEAN, ANYA.
WHY?

184
00:06:51,912 --> 00:06:53,121
(SIGHS)
UM...

185
00:06:53,205 --> 00:06:55,332
SOME OF OWEN'S FRIENDS
WERE DOING IT

186
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:57,626
AND I WAS HAVING
A REALLY BAD NIGHT.

187
00:06:57,709 --> 00:06:58,919
CLEARLY.

188
00:06:59,002 --> 00:07:00,963
I PROMISE
I WON'T DO IT AGAIN.

189
00:07:01,046 --> 00:07:02,339
GOOD.

190
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:03,340
'CAUSE IN A FEW MONTHS

191
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:05,509
WE'RE GOING TO BE ON
TO BIGGER AND BETTER THINGS.

192
00:07:05,592 --> 00:07:07,052
DON'T LET SOME GRADE ELEVEN

193
00:07:07,135 --> 00:07:08,595
WITH BLUE EYES
AND TOO MUCH GEL

194
00:07:08,679 --> 00:07:09,763
DRAG YOU DOWN.

195
00:07:09,847 --> 00:07:11,014
STOP BLAMING OWEN
FOR EVERYTHING.

196
00:07:11,098 --> 00:07:12,182
HE DIDN'T MAKE ME DO IT.

197
00:07:12,266 --> 00:07:13,308
FINE.

198
00:07:13,392 --> 00:07:15,936
JUST FOCUS ON YOUR ESSAY.

199
00:07:16,019 --> 00:07:16,937
CONSIDERING YOU MISSED
THE DEADLINES,

200
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:19,106
YOUR CHANCES HERE
ARE KINDA SLIM TO NONE.

201
00:07:19,189 --> 00:07:22,693
WELL, THANK YOU FOR THE VOTE
OF CONFIDENCE.

202
00:07:22,776 --> 00:07:26,738
I WOULD BE AN IDEAL CANDIDATE
FOR YOUR UNIVERSITY BECAUSE...

203
00:07:26,822 --> 00:07:29,366
BIANCA:
ATTENTION!
ASK ME WHAT IT'S LIKE-

204
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:32,202
NO, NO, NO,
NOT LISTENING.

205
00:07:32,286 --> 00:07:37,040
OKAY, I'VE GOT APPLICATIONS
AND I'VE GOT TO FOCUS, OKAY?

206
00:07:37,124 --> 00:07:39,376
PLEASE TELL ME YOU'RE HERE
TO HELP ME MAKE POSTERS?

207
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:40,377
ASK ME WHAT IT'S LIKE

208
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:42,671
LIVING WITH THE MOST
BEAUTIFUL GIRL ON EARTH.

209
00:07:42,754 --> 00:07:44,047
WHAT IS IT LIKE LIVING
WITH THE MOST-

210
00:07:44,131 --> 00:07:46,216
WONDERFUL!
SHE BROUGHT ME COFFEE.

211
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:47,384
OOH LA-LA!

212
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:51,054
I'M SO GLAD MAMA COYNE
LET CHARLIE MOVE IN.

213
00:07:52,055 --> 00:07:52,973
MAMA COYNE HAS NO CLUE.

214
00:07:53,056 --> 00:07:53,974
ONCE SHE GETS BACK

215
00:07:54,057 --> 00:07:55,100
FROM HER BUSINESS TRIP
IN NEW YORK

216
00:07:55,184 --> 00:07:56,101
AND SEES HOW HAPPY I AM,

217
00:07:56,185 --> 00:07:58,228
SHE'LL NEVER KICK
CHARLIE OUT.

218
00:07:58,312 --> 00:08:00,606
DOES CHARLIE KNOW
SHE'S A DIRTY LITTLE SECRET?

219
00:08:00,689 --> 00:08:02,983
AS THEY SAY, NO NEED
TO AIR OUT DIRTY LAUNDRY

220
00:08:03,066 --> 00:08:05,068
WHEN THERE'S PLENTY
OF FRESH!

221
00:08:05,152 --> 00:08:06,403
I DON'T KNOW ANYBODY
WHO SAYS THAT.

222
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:07,404
(LAUGHS)

223
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:09,907
HOLLY J, WE HAVE SO MANY
GOOD THINGS TO DISCOVER

224
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:10,908
ABOUT EACH OTHER

225
00:08:10,991 --> 00:08:13,076
AS WE FALL DEEPLY IN LOVE.

226
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,203
WHY GET HUNG UP
ON THE BAD?

227
00:08:14,286 --> 00:08:15,204
AND SHE HAS A CUTE KITTY.

228
00:08:15,287 --> 00:08:18,415
HIS NAME IS
MR. TUXEDO PANTS.

229
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:20,584
AND YOU'RE ALLERGIC
TO HIM?

230
00:08:20,667 --> 00:08:22,169
DON'T SAY THAT!

231
00:08:22,252 --> 00:08:23,587
I LOVE KITTIES.

232
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:24,671
BOTH:
(LAUGH)

233
00:08:26,673 --> 00:08:28,717
SO, I LEAVE FOR MY HOCKEY
TOURNAMENT TOMORROW.

234
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,178
DO I GET SOME ANYA TIME
BEFORE I GO?

235
00:08:31,261 --> 00:08:34,640
I'M ONLY THREE LINES
INTO MY ADMISSION ESSAY.

236
00:08:34,723 --> 00:08:36,683
SO, I GUESS WE'RE NOT
HANGING OUT.

237
00:08:36,767 --> 00:08:38,143
OKAY, WHAT IF I DON'T
GET IN, OWEN?

238
00:08:38,227 --> 00:08:40,270
THIS IS ALL I HAVE
GOING FOR ME RIGHT NOW.

239
00:08:40,354 --> 00:08:41,813
YOU KNOW, SCHOOLS AREN'T GOING
TO CARE IF YOU SUBMIT

240
00:08:41,897 --> 00:08:43,982
SOME STUPID APPLICATION.

241
00:08:44,066 --> 00:08:45,651
SO YOU'RE SAYING
I SHOULD JUST GIVE UP?

242
00:08:45,734 --> 00:08:47,110
YOU'RE SUCH
A CRAB BUCKET-ER!

243
00:08:47,194 --> 00:08:49,780
NO. I'M SAYING,
IF YOU WANT SOMETHING,

244
00:08:49,863 --> 00:08:50,781
TAKE IT.

245
00:08:50,864 --> 00:08:52,199
LIKE I DID WITH YOU.

246
00:08:52,282 --> 00:08:53,450
AND WHAT IS THAT
SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

247
00:08:53,534 --> 00:08:55,452
CALL 'EM.
TELL THEM YOUR STORY.

248
00:08:55,536 --> 00:08:57,037
YOU CAN'T JUST CALL.
THAT'S NOT HOW IT WORKS.

249
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,789
SAYS WHO?

250
00:08:58,872 --> 00:09:00,541
EXPLAIN YOU HELPED YOUR MOM
THROUGH CANCER.

251
00:09:00,624 --> 00:09:02,292
THAT'S WHY YOU'RE LATE.

252
00:09:03,293 --> 00:09:05,295
YOU THINK THEY'LL CARE?

253
00:09:05,379 --> 00:09:08,882
LOOK, A FEW PIECES OF PAPER
WITH SOME CHECKED BOXES ON IT

254
00:09:08,966 --> 00:09:11,969
AREN'T GONNA SHOW THEM
HOW AMAZING YOU ARE.

255
00:09:12,052 --> 00:09:14,471
AND AT OWEN UNIVERSITY,
YOU'D BE ON THE DEAN'S LIST.

256
00:09:14,555 --> 00:09:15,848
SHUT UP.

257
00:09:15,931 --> 00:09:17,015
(DIALLING BEEPS)

258
00:09:17,099 --> 00:09:18,016
NO, NO, NO.

259
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:20,060
YOU KNOW HOW NERVOUS I GET
ON THE PHONE!

260
00:09:20,143 --> 00:09:21,895
I'LL BE RIGHT HERE.

261
00:09:22,896 --> 00:09:23,856
(BELL RINGS)

262
00:09:23,939 --> 00:09:25,983
HI, ADMISSIONS?

263
00:09:26,066 --> 00:09:29,653
ELI:

WE OPEN THE PLAY WITH A SONG,

264
00:09:29,736 --> 00:09:31,280

00:09:31,363 --> 00:09:32,739
SO, LIKE A THEME SONG?

266
00:09:32,823 --> 00:09:33,824

268
00:09:38,078 --> 00:09:41,999
YEAH, I'M ALLERGIC
TO MR. TUXEDO PANTS.

269
00:09:42,082 --> 00:09:43,292
I'M NOT FOLLOWING.

270
00:09:43,375 --> 00:09:46,378
MY ROOMMATE'S CAT.
AND LOOK - HIVES!

271
00:09:48,422 --> 00:09:50,174
ELI:
THOSE LOOK LIKE BITES.

272
00:09:50,257 --> 00:09:51,175
MAY I?

273
00:09:51,258 --> 00:09:53,927
GROSS.
WHAT KIND OF BITES?

274
00:09:59,766 --> 00:10:01,810
ELI:
WEIRD. YOU'VE GOT BED BUGS.

275
00:10:01,894 --> 00:10:03,645
THEY HAVE EYES?

276
00:10:03,729 --> 00:10:06,773
UGH! OKAY,
I DO NOT HAVE BED BUGS!

277
00:10:07,774 --> 00:10:08,775
EWW!

278
00:10:11,737 --> 00:10:12,738
(BELL RINGS)

279
00:10:15,741 --> 00:10:18,869
ANYA:
A FACE-TO-FACE INTERVIEW
WITH THE HEAD OF ADMISSIONS!

280
00:10:18,952 --> 00:10:20,495
I TOLD YOU.
YOU'RE AMAZING.

281
00:10:20,579 --> 00:10:22,497
YOU KNOW, YOU'RE LIKE
MY CONFIDENCE.

282
00:10:22,581 --> 00:10:23,999
YOU MAKE ME FEEL
LIKE I CAN DO ANYTHING.

283
00:10:24,082 --> 00:10:25,918
OH STOP,
I'M BLUSHING.

284
00:10:26,001 --> 00:10:27,169
YOU KNOW, MY MOM ACTUALLY
DROPPED THE PHONE

285
00:10:27,252 --> 00:10:28,545
WHEN I TOLD HER.

286

WHO'S MADE ME FEEL GOOD
ABOUT MYSELF IN WEEKS.

289
00:10:37,262 --> 00:10:38,931
ARE YOU REWARDING ME
BY BEING IN A BIKINI?

290
00:10:39,014 --> 00:10:40,349
AND BY GOING OUT TONIGHT.

291

TWO TEAMS,
TWENTY BUCKS A PIECE.

300
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:58,575
WHAT'S THAT,
LIKE FORTY BUCKS?

301
00:10:58,659 --> 00:10:59,785
THERE ARE MORE TEAMS
REGISTERED.

302
00:10:59,868 --> 00:11:00,827
THEY'RE ON THEIR WAY.

WHAT HE MEANT TO SAY

304
00:11:02,162 --> 00:11:04,206
IS THAT HE CALLED SOME OF HIS
HOCKEY FRIENDS TO COME PLAY

305
00:11:04,289 --> 00:11:06,542
AND THAT THEY WILL
BE HERE SOON.

306

LET'S TALK ABOUT MY FUTURE
AS A UNIVERSITY GIRL.

00:11:11,922 --> 00:11:13,882
DO YOU THINK I CAN
GET INTO A SORORITY?

310
00:11:14,967 --> 00:11:15,884
THEN I'LL CODE
THE ALGORITHM.

311
00:11:15,968 --> 00:11:19,137
WAIT, FOR THE APP COMPETITION?
THIS SOUNDS ADVANCED.

312
00:11:19,221 --> 00:11:20,305
NO, IT'S ACTUALLY
QUITE SIMPLE.

313
00:11:20,389 --> 00:11:21,306
BEFORE THE DRESS CODE,

314
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:22,391
I STRUGGLED
WITH PICKING CLOTHES,

315
00:11:22,474 --> 00:11:23,892
AND GIRLS HAVE SO MANY
VARIETIES OF MATERIALS

316
00:11:23,976 --> 00:11:25,143
AND COLOURS.

317
00:11:25,227 --> 00:11:26,895

TO SOMETHING HERE.

318
00:11:26,979 --> 00:11:28,897

EQUALS OUTFIT X!

321
00:11:31,441 --> 00:11:32,734
AND THEN THE USERS TELL THE APP
HOW THEY'RE FEELING,

322
00:11:32,818 --> 00:11:33,735
AND THEN IT RECOMMENDS
AN OUTFIT

323
00:11:33,819 --> 00:11:35,904
FROM ARTICLES
IN THEIR WARDROBE.

324
00:11:35,988 --> 00:11:37,281

(GARBAGE CAN CLATTERS)

330

IT'S DEFINITELY BED BUGS.

331
00:12:48,435 --> 00:12:50,187
WHY DIDN'T I SEE THEM?

332
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:52,022
MY MOM IS GONNA BE
SO MAD AT ME.

333
00:12:52,105 --> 00:12:54,816
WELL, THESE BLOOD SUCKERS
ONLY COME OUT AT NIGHT.

334
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:56,735
THEY HIDE IN SMALL PLACES -

335
00:12:56,818 --> 00:13:00,531
SEAMS, TUFTS,
THE CREVICES IN YOUR MATTRESS.

336
00:13:00,614 --> 00:13:01,949
UGH! DISGUSTING!

337
00:13:03,951 --> 00:13:04,868
WHAT DO I NEED TO DO?

338
00:13:04,952 --> 00:13:06,537
WELL, IT'S A PROCESS.

339

YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO GET
ALL YOUR CLOTHES, LINENS,

340
00:13:08,413 --> 00:13:09,331

AND WE CAN HELP YOU WITH
THE CLEANING AND STEAMING,

342
00:13:10,249 --> 00:13:12,417

TO KEEP UP THE WORK

343
00:13:12,501 --> 00:13:13,919
TO MAKE SURE
THEY DON'T COME BACK.

344
00:13:14,002 --> 00:13:15,671
I'M A CLEAN PERSON,
YOU KNOW!

345
00:13:15,754 --> 00:13:17,631
HOW DID THEY EVEN
GET IN HERE?

346
00:13:17,714 --> 00:13:19,508
WELL, THEY CAN COME
FROM APARTMENT COMPLEXES,

347
00:13:19,591 --> 00:13:21,510
HOTEL BEDS, MOVIE THEATRES...

348
00:13:21,593 --> 00:13:23,345
I HAVEN'T BEEN
TO ANY OF THE ABOVE.

349
00:13:23,428 --> 00:13:25,180
WELL, MAYBE SOMEONE ELSE
