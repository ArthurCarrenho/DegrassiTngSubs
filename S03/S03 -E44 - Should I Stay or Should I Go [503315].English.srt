US, SOME MUSIC, MY BED.

187
00:11:18,178 --> 00:11:19,596
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

188
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,056
COMPLETELY.

189
00:11:25,686 --> 00:11:26,812
LOOK OUT!

190
00:11:26,895 --> 00:11:30,190
IT'S THE RETURN OF SNAKE'S
WICKED NACHO EXTRAVAGANZA!

191
00:11:30,274 --> 00:11:31,775
HEAVY ON THE GUAC.

192
00:11:33,193 --> 00:11:35,445
HONEY, COME ON,
YOU LOVE NACHOS.

193
00:11:35,529 --> 00:11:37,447
ARE YOU INSANE,
CHRISTINE?

194
00:11:37,531 --> 00:11:39,741
NACHOS?
YOU KNOW I'M NAUSEOUS.

195
00:11:39,825 --> 00:11:42,119
I THOUGHT THEY
MIGHT BE TEMPTING.

196
00:11:42,202 --> 00:11:43,871
YOU NEED TO KEEP UP
YOUR STRENGTH.

197
00:11:43,954 --> 00:11:46,832
WHAT I NEED
IS PEACE AND QUIET.

198
00:11:46,915 --> 00:11:47,749
(DOORBELL)

199
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:50,711
WHAT IS THIS,
GRAND CENTRAL STATION?

200
00:11:50,794 --> 00:11:51,795
I'LL GET IT.

201
00:11:58,969 --> 00:12:00,554
HEY, JOEY JEREMIAH,

202
00:12:01,388 --> 00:12:04,308
THE ONE MAN CHEER-UP MACHINE
HAS ARRIVED.

203
00:12:04,391 --> 00:12:05,976
PUT THIS ON, BUDDY.

204
00:12:09,062 --> 00:12:10,772
NICE TRY, JOEY.

205
00:12:12,524 --> 00:12:15,652
COME ON, EVERYBODY KNOWS
THAT SNAKE "STRIKE" SIMPSON

206
00:12:15,736 --> 00:12:18,655
CAN'T RESIST A FEW FRAMES
OF BOWLING.

207
00:12:18,739 --> 00:12:21,575
FILTHY BOWLING BALLS,
USED SHOES...

208
00:12:22,492 --> 00:12:23,785
CAN'T YOU JUST SMELL IT?

209
00:12:23,869 --> 00:12:25,829
IT'S NOT GOOD FOR MY CHEMO
COMPROMISED IMMUNITY

210
00:12:25,913 --> 00:12:26,997
AND I DON'T FEEL LIKE-

211
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,749
SPIKE (ANGRY):
PUT THE SHIRT ON, ARCHIE!

212
00:12:28,832 --> 00:12:30,334
YOU ARE NOT DEAD YET!

213
00:12:30,417 --> 00:12:32,920
PUT THE DAMN SHIRT ON,
AND GO!

214
00:12:41,428 --> 00:12:44,431
JOEY:
HEY, HE'S STILL GOT IT, FOLKS!

215
00:12:46,433 --> 00:12:48,936
NEXT UP?
GUTTER BALL FOR SURE.

216
00:12:49,019 --> 00:12:50,354
WHEELS:
SNAKE?

217
00:12:50,437 --> 00:12:52,439
NEVER GUTTERS OUT.

218
00:12:57,319 --> 00:12:57,736
JOEY?

219
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:04,201

220
00:13:04,284 --> 00:13:04,952
THANKS.

221
00:13:11,667 --> 00:13:13,335
JIMMY:
SHE'S COMING!

222
00:13:23,303 --> 00:13:26,723
SORRY, AM I KEEPING YOU
FROM SOMETHING?

223
00:13:26,807 --> 00:13:28,100
TONIGHT...

224
00:13:28,183 --> 00:13:30,602
AFTER EVERYBODY LEAVES?

225
00:13:30,686 --> 00:13:33,397
GUESS WHO'S STAYING OVER.

226
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:34,898
SHUT UP.

227
00:13:34,982 --> 00:13:37,901
YEAH, BELIEVE IT.
JUST A FEW HOURS...

228
00:13:37,985 --> 00:13:39,528
EVERYBODY:
SURPRISE!

229
00:13:39,611 --> 00:13:40,237
HOLY-

230
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,989
PAIGE:
A SURPRISE PARTY FOR ME?

231
00:13:42,072 --> 00:13:42,823
YOU GUYS!

232
00:13:44,157 --> 00:13:45,826
OH, THANK YOU.

233
00:13:48,662 --> 00:13:50,122
SPINNER:
HAPPY BIRTHDAY.

234
00:13:51,623 --> 00:13:52,165
HEY!

235
00:13:53,625 --> 00:13:54,877
WHAT ARE THEY DOING?

236
00:14:11,101 --> 00:14:12,519
WHEELS
WOO! ALL RIGHT!

237
00:14:14,021 --> 00:14:16,523
I HEARD YOU WERE SICK.

238
00:14:16,607 --> 00:14:17,733
YOU DON'T LOOK IT.

239
00:14:17,816 --> 00:14:18,734
NO.

240
00:14:18,817 --> 00:14:21,612
I JUST LIKE SHAVING MY HEAD
AND EYEBROWS FOR KICKS.

241
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:23,780
I'VE SEEN STRANGER.

242
00:14:26,617 --> 00:14:28,368
YOU DOIN' OKAY?

243
00:14:30,078 --> 00:14:30,829
NO.

244
00:14:32,206 --> 00:14:36,293
I'M STARTING TO WISH
IT WAS ALL JUST... OVER.

245
00:14:37,336 --> 00:14:40,047
YEAH, I KNOW
HOW THAT FEELS.

246
00:14:40,923 --> 00:14:42,549
NO YOU DON'T.

247
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:46,136
I'M SORRY
BUT THERE'S NO WAY YOU DO.

248
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:49,056
SNAKE, I WAS DRUNK,
I DROVE,

249
00:14:53,852 --> 00:14:55,521
I KILLED A KID.

250
00:14:56,563 --> 00:15:00,817
I THINK I KNOW WHAT WANTING
TO DIE FEELS LIKE.

251
00:15:04,196 --> 00:15:05,322
WHAT DID YOU DO?

252
00:15:05,405 --> 00:15:09,701
BECAUSE I HAVE NO IDEA
WHERE TO GO FROM HERE.

253
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:13,664
JUST FOUND SOMETHING
INSIDE ME

254
00:15:13,747 --> 00:15:16,416
THAT WANTED TO KEEP GOING.

255
00:15:19,419 --> 00:15:22,297
I'M REALLY SCARED,
WHEELS.

256
00:15:22,381 --> 00:15:25,050
I CAN'T EVEN TELL MY WIFE.

257
00:15:25,717 --> 00:15:28,053
BUT I'M REALLY SCARED.

258
00:15:30,097 --> 00:15:33,433
YOU HAVE TO KEEP FIGHTING,
BUDDY.

259
00:15:36,395 --> 00:15:39,773
JOEY:
OKAY, WE GOT
THREE SHIRLEY TEMPLES.

260
00:15:40,899 --> 00:15:42,609
NO, I'M KIDDING.
HERE.

261
00:15:43,443 --> 00:15:46,196
TO HEADS THAT MATCH
OUR BOWLING BALLS,

262
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:47,781
AND TO OLD FRIENDS.

263
00:15:47,865 --> 00:15:48,615
WHEELS:
CHEERS

264
00:15:48,699 --> 00:15:49,283
SIMPSON:
CHEERS.

265
00:15:53,579 --> 00:15:54,329
(CHEERING)

266
00:16:13,265 --> 00:16:14,641
ASHLEY:
YOU TOLD HIM?

267
00:16:14,725 --> 00:16:17,853
IT'S JUST SPIN
BEING AN IDIOT.

268
00:16:17,936 --> 00:16:19,104
WE HAVEN'T
EVEN HAD SEX YET,

269
00:16:19,188 --> 00:16:20,480
AND YOU'RE GOING
AROUND BRAGGING.

270
00:16:20,564 --> 00:16:21,857
WHOA, I TOLD ONE FRIEND.

271
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:23,734
THAT'S NOT EXACTLY
GOING AROUND.

272
00:16:23,817 --> 00:16:26,320
I THOUGHT THIS MEANT
SOMETHING TO YOU.

273
00:16:26,403 --> 00:16:27,696
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

274
00:16:27,779 --> 00:16:29,740
THIS WAS SUPPOSED TO BE
A PRIVATE THING -

275
00:16:29,823 --> 00:16:30,574
BETWEEN US.

276
00:16:30,657 --> 00:16:31,617
WELL I ONLY TOLD SPINNER

277
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:32,993
BECAUSE I WAS HAPPY.

278
00:16:33,076 --> 00:16:33,785
I BET YOU WERE.

279
00:16:33,869 --> 00:16:35,996
YOU CONNED ME INTO THINKING
I WANTED TO HAVE SEX WITH YOU

280
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:37,122
AND NOW YOU'RE-

281
00:16:37,206 --> 00:16:38,582
WAIT. WAIT.
I CONNED YOU INTO IT?

282
00:16:38,665 --> 00:16:40,709
WITH THAT STUPID LIE
OF A SONG.

283
00:16:40,792 --> 00:16:41,752
THAT WASN'T A LIE.

284
00:16:41,835 --> 00:16:42,544
WRONG.

285
00:16:42,628 --> 00:16:43,795
YOU DON'T KNOW HOW TO SAY IT,
CRAIG,

286
00:16:43,879 --> 00:16:46,632
BECAUSE YOU DON'T
REALLY LOVE ME.

287
00:17:00,437 --> 00:17:02,439
JIMMY:
YO MAN, YOU OKAY?

288
00:17:12,783 --> 00:17:13,784
(SLAMS DOOR)

289
00:17:23,085 --> 00:17:24,586
MANNY:
CRAIG! HEY!

290
00:17:26,588 --> 00:17:28,882
NOT NOW, MANNY.
OKAY?

291
00:17:29,424 --> 00:17:31,093
WHAT HAPPENED?

292
00:17:35,305 --> 00:17:36,807
I MESSED UP.

293
00:17:38,392 --> 00:17:41,061
AGAIN AND AGAIN
AND AGAIN-

294
00:17:42,563 --> 00:17:45,274
I'M SURE,
I'M SURE YOU DIDN'T.

295
00:17:45,357 --> 00:17:47,276
TELL ASHLEY THAT.

296
00:17:49,027 --> 00:17:51,655
YOU KNOW THAT SONG
YOU SANG TODAY?

297
00:17:51,738 --> 00:17:53,490
YOU HEARD THAT?

298
00:17:53,574 --> 00:17:55,450
IT WAS AMAZING.

299
00:17:55,534 --> 00:17:57,995
AND IF IT WAS FOR ME?

300
00:17:58,078 --> 00:18:01,290
I'D BE HAPPY
FOR MONTHS.

301
00:18:01,373 --> 00:18:02,541
FOREVER.

302
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:08,839

310
00:18:40,621 --> 00:18:42,206
IT'S NOT BAD.

311
00:18:44,958 --> 00:18:48,128
YOU WROTE THAT SONG
RIGHT HERE?

312
00:18:49,296 --> 00:18:51,840
WILL YOU PLAY IT
FOR ME?

313
00:18:51,924 --> 00:18:52,966
PLEASE?

314
00:18:55,511 --> 00:18:56,470

00:19:23,747 --> 00:19:24,998
AND WHAT?

318
00:19:26,667 --> 00:19:29,503
AND IF ASH
DOESN'T SEE THAT,

319
00:19:31,505 --> 00:19:34,424
THEN SHE DOESN'T
DESERVE YOU.

320
00:20:00,409 --> 00:20:01,743
IT'S OKAY.

321
00:20:36,570 --> 00:20:38,155
IT WAS THE BEST NIGHT
OF MY LIFE.

322
00:20:38,238 --> 00:20:39,656
JUST TELL ME
WHAT HAPPENED ALREADY!

323
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:42,826
NO, I CAN'T, NOT YET.
BUT SOON.

324
00:20:45,954 --> 00:20:47,247
HEY CRAIG!

325
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:50,792
I LEFT YOU, LIKE,
A ZILLION MESSAGES.

326
00:20:50,876 --> 00:20:52,920
YOU MUST'VE BEEN
REALLY BUSY.

327
00:20:53,003 --> 00:20:54,546
I MISSED YOU!

328
00:20:54,630 --> 00:20:56,215
LOOK MANNY, I'M NOT
REALLY SURE WHAT HAPPENED-

329
00:20:56,298 --> 00:20:57,299
ASHLEY:
HEY.

330
00:20:58,091 --> 00:21:01,762
UM, MANNY, CAN I TALK
TO CRAIG FOR A MINUTE?

331
00:21:07,184 --> 00:21:09,520
PAIGE AND I HAD A LONG TALK
AFTER YOU LEFT,

332
00:21:09,603 --> 00:21:10,896
AND I'M SO SORRY.

333
00:21:10,979 --> 00:21:12,731
I COMPLETELY OVER-REACTED.

334
00:21:12,814 --> 00:21:13,649
ASHLEY-

335
00:21:13,732 --> 00:21:17,528
ASHLEY:
LOOK, I KNOW WHAT YOU MEANT
ABOUT THIS NOT BEING EASY?

336
00:21:17,611 --> 00:21:21,031
IF YOU'D BE WILLING TO GIVE ME
ONE MORE CHANCE...

337
00:21:21,114 --> 00:21:22,366
YOU WANT ME BACK?

338
00:21:22,449 --> 00:21:24,034
MORE THAN ANYTHING.

339
00:21:24,952 --> 00:21:27,955
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
I LOVE YOU.
