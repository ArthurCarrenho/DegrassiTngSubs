EMMA? WHAT IS IT?

346
00:16:46,089 --> 00:16:47,257
NOTHING.

347
00:16:48,634 --> 00:16:51,303
MANNY:
THEN WHY DO YOU LOOK
LIKE YOU'RE GONNA CRY?

348
00:16:51,386 --> 00:16:54,723
HOME'S NOT TOO GOOD
RIGHT NOW, OKAY?

349
00:16:57,226 --> 00:16:58,477
MANNY:
IS IT THE BABY?

350
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:01,146
ARE YOUR,
ARE YOUR PARENTS FIGHTING?

351
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:04,691
SNAKE IS SICK
AND IT MIGHT BE BAD.

352
00:17:04,775 --> 00:17:06,151
BUT THEY'RE JUST
DOING TESTS,

353
00:17:06,235 --> 00:17:10,405
THERE MIGHT BE NOTHING
WRONG AT ALL, RIGHT?

354
00:17:10,489 --> 00:17:12,908
YEAH, HE'S GONNA BE FINE, EM.

355
00:17:14,493 --> 00:17:15,827
I KNOW IT.

356
00:17:21,083 --> 00:17:22,543
DIDN'T TOUCH THE RIM,

357
00:17:22,626 --> 00:17:26,255
SO SIXTEEN TO FOUR
EXTRA POINT POUR MOI.

358
00:17:26,338 --> 00:17:27,339
DUDE, I KNOW BASKETBALL'S
NOT YOUR GAME

359
00:17:27,422 --> 00:17:29,591
BUT COME ON, AT LEAST TRY.

360
00:17:36,056 --> 00:17:39,101
OH! WHAT'S THAT?
SIXTEEN TO FIVE?

361
00:17:39,184 --> 00:17:42,855
NO. NO IT'S NOT BECAUSE THIS
IS TWENTY-ONE WE'RE PLAYING.

362
00:17:42,938 --> 00:17:45,107
YOU SHOOT AND YOU SCORE.

363
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:46,400
THERE ARE NO LAY-UPS.

364
00:17:46,483 --> 00:17:48,902
OH WELL, WE MUST FOLLOW ALL
THE RULES TO THE LETTER

365
00:17:48,986 --> 00:17:51,488
OR MR. TEACHER WILL GET MAD.

366
00:17:51,572 --> 00:17:53,991
DUDE, YOU'RE WORSE THAN MARCO.

367
00:17:55,409 --> 00:17:57,202
WHAT'S BUGGING YOU NOW?

368
00:17:57,286 --> 00:17:58,787
SPINNER:
WHAT'S BOTH-

369
00:17:58,871 --> 00:18:01,456
THE GUY GETS A BLACK EYE,
AND IT'S THE END OF THE WORLD.

370
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:05,210
OH, OH, MY PRETTY LITTLE FACE.
(MOCK CRYING)

371
00:18:06,962 --> 00:18:07,296
HEY!

372
00:18:08,213 --> 00:18:10,549
LOOK, YOU WEREN'T THERE LAST
NIGHT WHEN I FOUND HIM, OKAY?

373
00:18:10,632 --> 00:18:13,260
OKAY, CALM DOWN, HERO.

374
00:18:13,343 --> 00:18:14,428
JUST RELAX.

375
00:18:14,511 --> 00:18:16,221
YOU'RE SUCH A LOSER.

376
00:18:16,305 --> 00:18:17,764
SPINNER:
WHY? 'CAUSE I'M NOT
ALL BROKEN UP

377
00:18:17,848 --> 00:18:20,392
OVER MARCO AND HIS
STOLEN DANCING SHOES?

378
00:18:20,475 --> 00:18:22,436
LOOK IF HE WOULD HAVE WALKED
TO THE GAME WITH US,

379
00:18:22,519 --> 00:18:23,562
NONE OF THAT WOULDA HAPPENED.

380
00:18:23,645 --> 00:18:26,565
LAST NIGHT WAS HIS FAULT,
NOT MINE!

381
00:18:37,576 --> 00:18:39,578
SO WAS IT THE HOSPITAL?

382
00:18:42,998 --> 00:18:43,415
AND...?

383
00:18:45,417 --> 00:18:48,212
BETTER GET USED
TO THE NEW LOOK.

384
00:18:48,295 --> 00:18:52,216
MY FIRST ROUND OF CHEMO'S
IN A COUPLE OF DAYS.

385
00:18:52,299 --> 00:18:54,635
IT LOOKS PRETTY SEXY, I THINK.

386
00:18:54,718 --> 00:18:56,929
YOU KNOW,
GET ME SOME FANCY DUDS,

387
00:18:57,012 --> 00:19:00,432
BUY ME A NEW SPORTS CAR,
I'LL BE STYLIN'.

388
00:19:03,143 --> 00:19:04,311
EM, DON'T CRY.

389
00:19:06,396 --> 00:19:07,439
DON'T CRY.

390
00:19:07,523 --> 00:19:09,024
THERE'S NOTHING
TO CRY ABOUT.

391
00:19:09,107 --> 00:19:11,527
SNAKE, YOU HAVE CANCER!

392
00:19:11,610 --> 00:19:14,530
YOU'RE SICK AND YOU'RE
ALWAYS JUST SO CALM,

393
00:19:14,613 --> 00:19:16,865
OR JOKING OR SHAVING YOUR HEAD
LIKE NOTHING'S WRONG.

394
00:19:16,949 --> 00:19:21,370
BECAUSE I HAVE TO BE LIKE THIS,
EMMA, IF I'M GONNA BEAT IT.

395
00:19:21,453 --> 00:19:22,955
AND ARE YOU?

396
00:19:23,455 --> 00:19:24,289
YES.

397
00:19:27,543 --> 00:19:30,045
I PROMISE YOU,
AND JACK,

398
00:19:30,838 --> 00:19:32,464
AND YOUR MOM.

399
00:19:33,924 --> 00:19:34,758
YES.

400
00:19:47,771 --> 00:19:49,481
JAY:
HEY MARCO.

401
00:19:50,148 --> 00:19:54,653
I ALWAYS KNEW YOU AND DYLAN
WERE MEANT FOR EACH OTHER.

402
00:19:55,153 --> 00:19:55,779
WHAT?

403
00:19:55,863 --> 00:19:56,530
(LAUGHS)

404
00:20:11,837 --> 00:20:12,754
NO, HUH?

405
00:20:12,838 --> 00:20:15,424
YOU DIDN'T TELL ANYBODY
MY SECRET, DID YOU SPIN?

406
00:20:15,507 --> 00:20:16,383
I DON'T NEED THIS.

407
00:20:16,466 --> 00:20:18,760
MAN, ALL I DID
WAS TELL YOU THE TRUTH.

408
00:20:18,844 --> 00:20:20,053
SPINNER:
I NEVER ASKED YOU TO.

409
00:20:20,137 --> 00:20:23,223
AND JUST LIKE I
DIDN'T ASK TO BE GAY.

410
00:20:23,307 --> 00:20:25,100
OR YOU DIDN'T ASK
TO LIKE PAIGE,

411
00:20:25,184 --> 00:20:26,810
OR CRAIG DIDN'T ASK
TO LIKE ASH!

412
00:20:26,894 --> 00:20:28,896
IT'S NOT THE SAME.

413
00:20:29,563 --> 00:20:31,732
NO, YOU GET IT EASY.

414
00:20:34,193 --> 00:20:36,361
THEN STOP BEING GAY!

415
00:20:37,529 --> 00:20:38,989
OH RIGHT, SPIN.
I'M JUST GOING TO GO DO THAT.

416
00:20:39,072 --> 00:20:40,073
WELL, WHY NOT?

417
00:20:40,157 --> 00:20:43,285
IT'S NOT LIKE YOU'VE
ACTUALLY DONE ANYTHING YET.

418
00:20:43,368 --> 00:20:45,662
NOT THAT I NEED TO KNOW.

419
00:20:45,746 --> 00:20:46,705
SPIN.

420
00:20:46,788 --> 00:20:48,415
SPINNER:
AND NOBODY ELSE
NEEDS TO KNOW EITHER.

421
00:20:48,498 --> 00:20:52,544
I MEAN, YOU CAN TRY
DATING HAZEL, FOR REAL.

422
00:20:54,463 --> 00:20:55,631
WHY NOT?

423
00:20:58,675 --> 00:21:00,844
EVEN STRANGERS KNOW, SPIN.

424
00:21:04,431 --> 00:21:07,518
AND LAST NIGHT WASN'T
ABOUT MY SHOES.

425
00:21:07,601 --> 00:21:09,937
THOSE GUYS... THEY KNEW.

426
00:21:11,855 --> 00:21:15,442
AND THEY BASHED ME,
BECAUSE THEY HATE IT.

427
00:21:15,526 --> 00:21:17,444
JUST LIKE YOU DO.

428
00:21:20,572 --> 00:21:21,823
DUDE, THAT'S BRUTAL,

429
00:21:21,907 --> 00:21:25,661
BUT YOU CAN'T COMPARE
ME TO THOSE GUYS.

430
00:21:26,161 --> 00:21:27,246
REALLY?

431
00:21:27,913 --> 00:21:29,206
WHY NOT?
