168
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:03,525
YOU LIKE HIM, RIGHT?

169
00:08:03,609 --> 00:08:05,027
THEN ASK HIM OUT.

170
00:08:06,612 --> 00:08:08,488
I DON'T THINK
HE'S READY.

171
00:08:08,572 --> 00:08:11,283
WHAT'S THE WORST
THAT COULD HAPPEN?

172

173
00:08:16,121 --> 00:08:17,915
AND IT WAS A DISASTER.

174
00:08:17,998 --> 00:08:19,708
I JUST DON'T WANT TO PUT MARCO
THROUGH THAT.

175
00:08:19,791 --> 00:08:21,126
IT WON'T HAPPEN.

176
00:08:21,793 --> 00:08:24,505
WHAT DO YOU KNOW
ABOUT BEING GAY?

177
00:08:24,588 --> 00:08:26,673
WELL, I KNOW MARCO.

HOW CAN A FRUITY-BOY

356
00:18:29,359 --> 00:18:33,030
CARRY THOSE PLATES
WITH THOSE LIMP WRISTS?

357
00:18:33,113 --> 00:18:33,488
PA...

358
00:18:33,572 --> 00:18:35,199
MR. DEL ROSSI:
I NEVER UNDERSTAND THAT KIND?

359
00:18:35,282 --> 00:18:38,035
TWO MEN. TOGETHER...
IS DISGUSTING.

360
00:18:38,952 --> 00:18:40,037
MARCO:
PA...

361
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:40,913
IT'S SICKENING.

362
00:18:40,996 --> 00:18:41,663
PA, STOP!

363
00:18:47,127 --> 00:18:47,836
THE TIME -

364
00:18:49,046 --> 00:18:52,508
UH, I'VE GOT EARLY PRACTICE
TOMORROW SO...

365
00:18:52,591 --> 00:18:54,343
NICE MEETING YOU BOTH.

366
00:18:55,677 --> 00:18:59,348
MR. DEL ROSSI:
NICE TO MEET YOU TOO.

367
00:18:59,431 --> 00:19:00,891
THAT'S A NICE BOY.

368
00:19:00,974 --> 00:19:01,767
MRS. DEL ROSSI:
HOW CAN YOU SAY THAT?

369
00:19:01,850 --> 00:19:02,726
MR. DEL ROSSI:
SAY WHAT?

370
00:19:02,809 --> 00:19:03,352
MRS. DEL ROSSI:
YOU GOT A BIG MOUTH.

371
00:19:03,435 --> 00:19:04,186
MR. DEL ROSSI:
I GOT A BIG MOUTH?

372
00:19:04,269 --> 00:19:06,730
JUST PUT THE PASTA IN YOUR BIG
MOUTH AND LEAVE ME ALONE.

373
00:19:06,813 --> 00:19:07,606
I DON'T MAKE NO COMMOTIONS,
YOU MAKE...

374
00:19:16,281 --> 00:19:18,992
JAY:
HEY, WHERE'S YOUR DOG, DAWG?

375
00:19:20,285 --> 00:19:23,372
SEAN:
HAS HE BEEN GETTING UP
IN YOUR FRIES?

376
00:19:26,416 --> 00:19:30,254
IT'S A FUN WAY TO START
TO THE DAY, HUH?

377
00:19:32,631 --> 00:19:35,342
JT, YOUR COMMERCIAL SUCKED.

378
00:19:35,425 --> 00:19:36,009
THANKS.

379
00:19:37,469 --> 00:19:38,720
BUT YOU DIDN'T.

380
00:19:40,347 --> 00:19:42,099
YOU WERE GREAT.

381
00:19:44,476 --> 00:19:47,104
WELL, YOU MIND TELLING
EVERYONE IN THE SCHOOL THAT?

382
00:19:47,187 --> 00:19:49,189
COMING FROM THE SCHOOL TRAMP,

383
00:19:49,273 --> 00:19:51,608
I DON'T THINK THEY'D LISTEN.

384
00:19:53,402 --> 00:19:55,320
I DO NOT WANT TO GO
IN THERE.

385
00:19:55,404 --> 00:19:57,364
MANNY:
I KNOW,

386
00:19:57,447 --> 00:19:59,950
BUT WE'VE GOT ARMSTRONG'S TEST

387
00:20:00,659 --> 00:20:03,287
AND WE HAVE TO GET OUR MATH ON.

388
00:20:03,996 --> 00:20:06,164
I AM SO GOING TO KILL YOU!

389
00:20:12,588 --> 00:20:14,590
MARCO:
LOOK SPIN, I'M TELLING YOU,
OKAY?

390
00:20:14,673 --> 00:20:16,842
IT WAS THE DATE FROM HELL.

391
00:20:17,509 --> 00:20:21,513
AND I DON'T KNOW HOW I'M GOING
TO FACE DYLAN TODAY, NOW.

392
00:20:22,347 --> 00:20:25,434
WELL, YOU'RE ABOUT
TO FIND OUT.

393
00:20:28,604 --> 00:20:29,730
DYLAN:
HEY.

394
00:20:29,813 --> 00:20:30,147
HEY.

395
00:20:31,982 --> 00:20:33,483
TALK TO YOU A SEC?

396
00:20:34,484 --> 00:20:34,860
OKAY.

397
00:20:38,363 --> 00:20:42,534
MARCO:
LOOK, YOU DON'T HAVE TO EXPLAIN
ABOUT WHAT MY DAD SAID.

398
00:20:42,618 --> 00:20:43,827
DYLAN:
NO, IT WAS STUPID AND OFFENSIVE,

399
00:20:43,911 --> 00:20:46,872
BUT YOU KNOW,
WE'VE BOTH HEARD WORSE.

400
00:20:46,955 --> 00:20:49,499
YEAH, BUT THE WAY
YOU JUST RUN OFF LIKE THAT...

401
00:20:49,583 --> 00:20:51,627
YOU LOOKED LIKE YOU WERE
GOING INTO CARDIAC ARREST.

402
00:20:51,710 --> 00:20:52,753
I WAS SPARING YOU.

403
00:20:52,836 --> 00:20:53,837
(BOTH LAUGH)

404
00:20:55,214 --> 00:20:59,551
MAN, AFTER THAT PIMP HAT,
AND THE BEE INCIDENT,

405
00:21:01,094 --> 00:21:03,764
AND THEN
WHAT MY DAD SAID?

406
00:21:05,891 --> 00:21:06,683
I JUST...

407
00:21:06,767 --> 00:21:09,520
I THOUGHT YOU WERE NEVER
GOING TO TALK TO ME AGAIN.

408
00:21:09,603 --> 00:21:12,356
WELL, IT CROSSED MY MIND,
BUT UH...

409
00:21:13,148 --> 00:21:15,651
I DO THINK
YOU'RE PRETTY CUTE.

410
00:21:16,401 --> 00:21:20,197
SO THEN, DOES THAT MEAN
I GET ANOTHER SHOT?

411
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:22,449
A CHANCE TO REDEEM MYSELF?

412
00:21:23,283 --> 00:21:25,118
THAT DEPENDS.

413
00:21:30,415 --> 00:21:32,376
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
THIS FRIDAY?

414
00:21:32,459 --> 00:21:33,126
(BREATHY CHUCKLE)
