00:00:18,519 --> 00:00:18,852
HEY.

4
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:25,526
SAYING GOODBYE
IS THE WORST PART.

5
00:00:25,609 --> 00:00:26,860
SERIOUSLY.

6
00:00:26,944 --> 00:00:28,153
I'M GONNA BE FINE.

7
00:00:28,237 --> 00:00:30,239
IT'S JUST A
PEACEKEEPING MISSION.

8
00:00:30,322 --> 00:00:31,949
I KNOW, BUT-

9
00:00:36,787 --> 00:00:38,080
YOUR MOTHER'S FINE.

10
00:00:38,163 --> 00:00:40,707
SHE'S UNDER CONTROL.

11
00:00:40,791 --> 00:00:43,418
THERE'S MY GIRL,
COME ON.

12
00:00:47,464 --> 00:00:49,132
IT'LL BE FINE.

WHAT ARE YOU,
MY COUNSELOR?

37
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,634
SORRY. IT'S JUST,
YOUR DAD LEFT YESTERDAY, AND-

38
00:02:13,717 --> 00:02:16,887
HE'S IN THE ARMY.
HE LEAVES. IT HAPPENS.

39
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:18,972
SO DO YOU WANT TO GO
TO A MOVIE AFTER SCHOOL?

40
00:02:19,056 --> 00:02:20,807
SWEET. AND I WOULD,

41
00:02:20,891 --> 00:02:22,559
BUT I GOT MY CO-OP INTERVIEW.

42
00:02:22,643 --> 00:02:24,311
RIGHT. YOU NERVOUS?

43
00:02:24,394 --> 00:02:26,730
INTERVIEWING FOR
MY DREAM JOB?

44
00:02:26,813 --> 00:02:29,399
WHY WOULD THAT
MAKE ME NERVOUS?

45
00:02:29,483 --> 00:02:30,651
NOT THAT IT MATTERS.

46
00:02:30,734 --> 00:02:32,236
PAIGE IS GONNA GET IT.

47
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:34,947
WELL, CAITLIN'S TV SHOW IS
ABOUT SOCIAL ISSUES, RIGHT?

48
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:37,282
PAIGE PROBABLY THINKS
IT'S ABOUT SOCIAL LIFE.

49
00:02:37,366 --> 00:02:40,869
"HI, I'M PAIGE M.
REPORTING FOR STYLE FACTOR."

50
00:02:40,953 --> 00:02:42,204
YOU'LL GET IT.
JUST BE YOURSELF.

51
00:02:42,287 --> 00:02:45,374
LIKE THAT'S GONNA
GET ME THE JOB.

52
00:02:49,503 --> 00:02:50,879
HAZEL:
BY THE TIME SCOTT
CALLS ME BACK?

53
00:02:50,963 --> 00:02:54,174
I'M ON THE OTHER LINE
WITH PAIGE.

54
00:02:54,258 --> 00:02:55,676
YOUR SECRET ADMIRER
STRUCK AGAIN!

55
00:02:55,759 --> 00:02:57,469
THAT'S THE FOURTH ONE.

56
00:02:57,553 --> 00:02:58,846
AND YOU HAVE NO IDEA
WHO IT IS?

57
00:02:58,929 --> 00:03:01,139
CAN'T YOU JUST ASK
YOUR TAROT CARDS?

58
00:03:01,223 --> 00:03:04,393
TAROT DOESN'T WORK
LIKE THAT.

59
00:03:04,476 --> 00:03:07,020
BESIDES, WITH MY LUCK
IT'S PROBABLY THE JANITOR.

60
00:03:07,104 --> 00:03:09,189
PLEASE,
IT COULD BE ANYONE.

61
00:03:09,273 --> 00:03:12,025
I KNOW WHO I WANT IT
TO BE.

62
00:03:15,112 --> 00:03:16,655
YOU'VE GOT THE HOTS
FOR RICK?

63
00:03:16,738 --> 00:03:17,906
SHHHH!

64
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:19,199
YOU SHOULD ASK HIM OUT.

65
00:03:19,283 --> 00:03:20,242
BUT WHAT IF IT'S NOT HIM?

66
00:03:20,325 --> 00:03:21,493
COME ON...

67
00:03:23,954 --> 00:03:26,373
TERRI:
I GOT TO GET TO CLASS.

68
00:03:32,796 --> 00:03:34,381
ELLIE:
HOMEWORK.

69
00:03:34,464 --> 00:03:35,591
TALK TO ME.

70
00:03:35,674 --> 00:03:38,010
MARCO:
WHAT? YOU DIDN'T DO IT?

71
00:03:38,093 --> 00:03:39,428
ELLIE,
READY FOR THE INTERVIEW?

72
00:03:39,511 --> 00:03:40,888
I AM SO NERVOUS.

73
00:03:40,971 --> 00:03:42,764
MY MOM WAS LIKE,
"PAIGE, YOU'VE GOT THE CLOTHES,

74
00:03:42,848 --> 00:03:44,725
YOU'VE GOT THE BRAINS,
YOU'RE FINE."

75
00:03:44,808 --> 00:03:45,684
OF COURSE.

76
00:03:45,767 --> 00:03:47,394
PAIGE:
PLEASE. MOTHERS ALWAYS
SAY THAT.

77
00:03:47,477 --> 00:03:49,438
IT IS SO TEDIOUS.

78
00:03:50,898 --> 00:03:53,442
ARMSTRONG:
OKAY FOLKS,
PUT YOUR BOOKS AWAY.

79
00:03:53,525 --> 00:03:54,318
NO WAY.

80
00:03:54,401 --> 00:03:56,570
ARMSTRONG:
WE'RE STARTING TODAY
WITH A POP QUIZ.

81
00:03:56,653 --> 00:03:59,740
NOW IF YOU DID YOUR HOMEWORK,
YOU SHOULD BE FINE.

82
00:03:59,823 --> 00:04:03,493
PAIGE? CAN YOU HAND THESE
OUT FOR ME, PLEASE?

83
00:04:04,453 --> 00:04:06,371
BREAK A LEG, HON.

84
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:15,839
MARCO:
OKAY SO, WHY DO TEACHERS LIE?

85
00:04:15,923 --> 00:04:17,257
I DID THE HOMEWORK,
LIKE HE SAID.

86
00:04:17,341 --> 00:04:19,092
I WAS NOT FINE.

87
00:04:19,176 --> 00:04:20,844
MARCO,
YOU GOT A B-PLUS.

88
00:04:20,928 --> 00:04:23,096
YEAH,
BUT MY AVERAGE IS-

89
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:24,723
ELLIE:
IT'S ONLY WORTH WHAT?

90
00:04:24,806 --> 00:04:26,600
TWO PERCENT OF OUR FINAL GRADE?

91
00:04:26,683 --> 00:04:27,893
WE'RE BOTH GONNA PASS.

92
00:04:27,976 --> 00:04:30,145
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU'RE
THIS COOL ABOUT IT!

93
00:04:30,229 --> 00:04:31,772
ACTUALLY, MARCO, I-

94
00:04:31,855 --> 00:04:33,565
OH DIO MIO. (MY GOD)

95
00:04:39,029 --> 00:04:41,365
UM, YEAH,
HOLD THAT THOUGHT.

96
00:04:47,204 --> 00:04:49,706
PAIGE:
(SIGHS) SUCKS TO BE STRAIGHT.

97
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:51,750
COME ON, IT'S GOTTA BE HARD

98
00:04:51,834 --> 00:04:56,964
WATCHING YOUR EX-BOYFRIEND FALL
MADLY IN LOVE WITH MY BROTHER?

99
00:04:57,047 --> 00:04:58,340
SAUVE:
HI GIRLS, SORRY TO INTERRUPT
YOUR LUNCH.

100
00:04:58,423 --> 00:05:01,468
I NEED YOU TO FILL THESE OUT
BEFORE YOUR CO-OP INTERVIEWS.

101
00:05:01,552 --> 00:05:03,178
AND ASHLEY, CONGRATS.

102
00:05:03,262 --> 00:05:04,721
IT'S REALLY HARD TO GET
THOSE RECORD COMPANY JOBS.

103
00:05:04,805 --> 00:05:08,392
BUT REMEMBER SCHOOL
IS YOUR FIRST PRIORITY.

104
00:05:10,769 --> 00:05:13,355
SINCE WHEN DO YOU WEAR GLASSES?

105
00:05:13,438 --> 00:05:15,649
ALL RIGHT,
WHAT'S MY GOAL?

106
00:05:15,732 --> 00:05:18,151
HELLO - ON-CAMERA, ANCHOR DESK.

107
00:05:18,235 --> 00:05:20,612
IT'S NOT AN ON-CAMERA JOB.

108
00:05:20,696 --> 00:05:22,948
IT'S TELEVISION - SAME DEAL.

109
00:05:24,116 --> 00:05:24,283
WHAT'S YOUR GOAL?

110
00:05:24,366 --> 00:05:25,075
ELLIE:
PAIGE-

111
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:26,159
PAIGE:
WHAT? I'M JUST-

112
00:05:29,746 --> 00:05:31,832
OH ELLIE, I AM SO SORRY-

113
00:05:34,501 --> 00:05:35,919
DON'T. IT'S FINE.

114
00:05:41,258 --> 00:05:43,927
PAIGE:
WHAT? IT WAS AN ACCIDENT.

115
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:09,536
PAIGE:
I AM THRILLED THAT I FINALLY
GOT TO MEET YOU, CAITLIN.

116
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:12,873
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR
THE AMAZING INTERVIEW.

117
00:06:12,956 --> 00:06:15,542
CAITLIN:
OH YOU'RE VERY WELCOME.
BYE, BYE.

118
00:06:15,626 --> 00:06:18,295
ELLIE, HI.
IS THAT FOR ME?

119
00:06:20,088 --> 00:06:21,048
GREAT.

120
00:06:21,131 --> 00:06:23,217
YOU CAN TAKE THE COAT OFF.

121
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:23,800
RIGHT.

122
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:27,804
SO I REALLY LOVED
THE PIECE ON TENT CITY.

123
00:06:27,888 --> 00:06:30,224
I ACTUALLY INTERVIEWED ONE OF
THOSE GUYS FOR THE GRAPEVINE.

124
00:06:30,307 --> 00:06:32,017
OH REALLY?
WHICH ONE?

125
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,395
AH, I FORGET HIS NAME.

126
00:06:36,897 --> 00:06:39,525
YOUNG. BROWN HAIR, GLASSES...

127
00:06:39,608 --> 00:06:40,984
ANDREW LISTER?

128
00:06:41,068 --> 00:06:43,070
THAT'S IT.
I-I ACTUALLY-

129
00:06:47,491 --> 00:06:47,991
SORRY.

130
00:06:49,993 --> 00:06:51,328
I'M REALLY NERVOUS.

131
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:53,413
THAT'S OKAY.
HERE.

132
00:06:54,581 --> 00:06:55,457
HAVE A SEAT,

133
00:06:55,541 --> 00:06:58,085
AND JUST TELL ME WHAT
YOU WERE GOING TO WISH FOR.

134
00:06:58,168 --> 00:07:00,671
JUST IT'S PROBABLY
STUPID BUT...

135
00:07:01,213 --> 00:07:03,590
IT'D BE COOL TO SEE THOSE
ACTIVISTS NOW,

136
00:07:03,674 --> 00:07:05,634
NOW THAT THE TENTS ARE GONE.

137
00:07:05,717 --> 00:07:08,554
ACTUALLY? WE'RE DOING
A FOLLOW-UP.

138
00:07:09,805 --> 00:07:11,056
OKAY. WELL, UH...

139
00:07:11,807 --> 00:07:13,308
TELL ME ABOUT THE GRAPEVINE.

140
00:07:13,392 --> 00:07:14,977
HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN
WRITING FOR THEM?

141
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:16,061
UM, A WHILE.

142
00:07:18,105 --> 00:07:19,982
CAITLIN:
IT'S A GREAT PAPER
TO BE WRITING FOR.

143
00:07:21,984 --> 00:07:24,194
HAZEL:
STOP BEING SUCH A CHICKEN.

144
00:07:24,278 --> 00:07:26,530
ANYONE ELSE WOULD JUST ASK HIM.

145
00:07:26,613 --> 00:07:28,824
HEY MANNY, HELP ME OUT HERE.

146
00:07:28,907 --> 00:07:29,992
SAY YOU LIKE A GUY-

147
00:07:30,075 --> 00:07:31,076
IS HE SINGLE?

148
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:32,911
WE THINK SO.
DO YOU GO FOR IT?

149
00:07:32,995 --> 00:07:35,372
COMPLETELY.
LIFE'S TOO SHORT.

150
00:07:36,957 --> 00:07:38,208
TERRI:
FINE.

151
00:07:38,292 --> 00:07:39,376
TOMORROW, IN GEOGRAPHY
I'LL--

152
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:41,211
TOBY:
HELLO, THERESE.

153
00:07:42,963 --> 00:07:43,463
HELLO.

154
00:07:44,381 --> 00:07:47,467
DO YOU KNOW WHAT
I'M THINKING?

155
00:07:47,551 --> 00:07:48,385
NO.

156
00:07:48,802 --> 00:07:50,387
OH. I THINK YOU DO.

157
00:07:51,263 --> 00:07:53,765
MANNY:
TOBY, STOP BEING WEIRD.

158
00:07:54,850 --> 00:07:56,894
UNTIL NEXT WE MEET.

159
00:07:58,896 --> 00:08:02,399
HAZEL:
OR MAYBE YOUR ADMIRER IS TOBY.

160
00:08:03,066 --> 00:08:03,901
BOTH:
UGH.

161
00:08:08,197 --> 00:08:09,406
ELLIE:
MOM?

162
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:10,741
SORRY I'M LATE.

163
00:08:20,626 --> 00:08:21,793
MOM? YOU OKAY?

164
00:08:25,506 --> 00:08:25,839
MMM...

165
00:08:32,846 --> 00:08:36,183
I BROUGHT US SOME DINNER
LIKE YOU ASKED.

166
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:58,580
HAD MY INTERVIEW.

167
00:08:59,581 --> 00:09:01,250
TOTAL DISASTER.

168
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:04,211
MY WHOLE DAY WAS A DISASTER.

169
00:09:05,379 --> 00:09:06,797
LOOK AT MY SHIRT.

170
00:09:13,178 --> 00:09:14,930
UGH, THE SMELL.

171
00:09:30,612 --> 00:09:30,988
OKAY.

172
00:09:32,823 --> 00:09:33,198
OKAY.

173
00:09:35,951 --> 00:09:36,326
OKAY.

174
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:47,838
MRS. NASH:
(CRASH) OH NO...

175
00:09:50,048 --> 00:09:51,717
(THROWING UP SOUNDS)

176
00:10:18,493 --> 00:10:19,161
(CRYING)

177
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:35,719
(ALARM)

178
00:10:48,649 --> 00:10:49,983
PAIGE:
CAITLIN IS AWESOME.

I'M JUST SORRY IT'S ONLY

00:18:15,429 --> 00:18:18,432
SO, YOU'RE NOT

LOOK, I DON'T CARE
IF YOU GET MAD.

301
00:18:45,459 --> 00:18:47,419
WHAT YOU'RE DOING
IS DANGEROUS, OKAY?

302
00:18:47,503 --> 00:18:48,921
IT'S SCARY.

303
00:18:50,088 --> 00:18:52,299
YOU CAN'T HANDLE IT.

304
00:18:52,382 --> 00:18:55,802
YOU HAVE TO TAKE AWAY
THE ONE THING THAT MATTERS.

305
00:18:55,886 --> 00:18:57,679
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING
ABOUT?

306
00:18:57,763 --> 00:19:00,015
YOU WANT MY CO-OP JOB.

307
00:19:00,098 --> 00:19:01,725
I DON'T CARE ABOUT
THE STUPID JOB!

308
00:19:01,808 --> 00:19:04,311
YOU'RE HURTING YOURSELF.

309
00:19:05,312 --> 00:19:06,688
THIS IS BEYOND ME.

310
00:19:06,772 --> 00:19:07,439
I DON'T KNOW HOW
TO HELP YOU,

311
00:19:07,523 --> 00:19:08,732
BUT SAUVE WILL.

312
00:19:08,815 --> 00:19:09,816
I DON'T NEED HELP.

313
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:11,860
THEN SHOW ME YOUR ARM.

314
00:19:11,944 --> 00:19:13,695
ELLIE:
THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH ME.

315
00:19:13,779 --> 00:19:15,614
THEN SHOW ME YOUR ARM.

316
00:19:18,909 --> 00:19:19,409
ELLIE.

317
00:19:20,994 --> 00:19:23,664
ELLIE, PLEASE,
SHOW ME YOUR ARM.

318
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:40,514
OH, ELLIE...

319
00:19:44,726 --> 00:19:45,561
IT'S OKAY.

320
00:19:48,814 --> 00:19:49,648
IT'S OKAY.

321
00:19:51,358 --> 00:19:52,693
IT'S OKAY.

322
00:20:05,330 --> 00:20:05,956
UH, HI.

323
00:20:08,125 --> 00:20:10,043
UM... YES,
YOU'VE CAUGHT ME.

324
00:20:10,127 --> 00:20:12,004
I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR HOURS.

325
00:20:12,087 --> 00:20:13,755
I CAN'T BELIEVE
HOW SNEAKY YOU ARE.

326
00:20:13,839 --> 00:20:15,007
WELL, FOR ONE,

327
00:20:15,549 --> 00:20:17,843
A SECRET ADMIRER
IS A DEMANDING OCCUPATION.

328
00:20:17,926 --> 00:20:19,970
AND TWO,
YOU'RE WORTH IT.

329
00:20:24,975 --> 00:20:26,852
I DO HOPE LEAVING ROSES
WASN'T INTRUSIVE.

330
00:20:26,935 --> 00:20:28,437
I'M A LITTLE SHY.

331
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:29,897
ME TOO.

332
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:32,399
AND I THINK IT'S SWEET.

333
00:20:32,983 --> 00:20:34,735
RICK:
YOU HAD NO INKLING IT WAS ME?

334
00:20:34,818 --> 00:20:37,779
TERRI:
NOPE. GUESS I'M NOT PSYCHIC.

335
00:21:05,224 --> 00:21:08,727
SAUVE:
WELL, THAT'S ALL THE TIME
WE HAVE FOR TODAY.

336
00:21:08,810 --> 00:21:09,311
SORRY.

337
00:21:11,730 --> 00:21:13,190
I WASTED YOUR TIME.

338
00:21:13,273 --> 00:21:13,524
NO.

339
00:21:14,691 --> 00:21:16,777
YOU'LL TALK
WHEN YOU'RE READY.

340
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:20,864
BUT RECOGNIZING THAT YOU
NEED TO TALK, AND NOT CUT -

341
00:21:20,948 --> 00:21:23,450
THAT'S A BIG FIRST STEP.

342
00:21:26,286 --> 00:21:27,788
SO TOMORROW?

343
00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:36,004
TOMORROW.
