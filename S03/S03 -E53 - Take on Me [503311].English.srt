00:00:26,777 --> 00:00:28,362
RADITCH:
GOOD MORNING, STUDENTS.

2
00:00:28,445 --> 00:00:31,448
GLAD YOU COULD ALL MAKE IT
ON A BEAUTIFUL SATURDAY.

3
00:00:31,532 --> 00:00:34,785
BUT THEN, IT'S NOT LIKE
YOU HAD MUCH CHOICE.

4
00:00:34,868 --> 00:00:36,995
WELCOME TO DETENTION.

5
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:38,455
NO TALKING.

6
00:00:39,373 --> 00:00:40,624
NO CHEWING GUM.

7
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:43,502
NO GETTING UP.

8
00:00:43,585 --> 00:00:45,295
NO FEET ON THE TABLE.

9
00:00:46,213 --> 00:00:47,673
NO DOING YOUR NAILS.

10
00:00:47,756 --> 00:00:49,675
NO EATING, UNTIL I SAY.

11
00:00:50,467 --> 00:00:55,097
THERE IS ONE BATHROOM PASS
WHICH YOU MUST CARRY WITH YOU.

12
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:57,099
YOU GET ONE HALF HOUR
FOR LUNCH.

13
00:00:57,182 --> 00:01:00,561
THE REST OF THE TIME
IS SPENT DOING HOMEWORK.

14
00:01:00,644 --> 00:01:04,147
THIS IS A TIME TO REFLECT
ON PAST BEHAVIOR.

15
00:01:05,399 --> 00:01:07,901
