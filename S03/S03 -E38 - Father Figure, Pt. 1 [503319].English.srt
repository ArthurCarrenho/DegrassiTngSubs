MR. SIMPSON MARRIED MY MOM,

99
00:04:44,243 --> 00:04:46,495
DOESN'T MEAN I AUTOMATICALLY
TOOK HIS NAME.

100

149
00:06:50,369 --> 00:06:52,788
EX-BOYFRIEND.
CAN WE DROP IT?

150
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:55,958
CRAIG:
WHY? WHAT'D HE DO?

151
00:06:57,751 --> 00:07:01,171
OKAY, WELL UH... GUESS I'LL JUST
HAVE TO GO ASK MR. SIMPSON.

152
00:07:01,255 --> 00:07:01,880
HEY MR. S?!

153
00:07:01,964 --> 00:07:02,881
FINE.

154
00:07:05,509 --> 00:07:09,471
HE GOT MY MOM PREGNANT
AND THEN TOOK OFF.

155
00:07:10,597 --> 00:07:12,307
THAT'S YOUR DAD?

156
00:07:12,391 --> 00:07:13,392
SHANE MCKAY.

157
00:07:14,142 --> 00:07:17,646
BUT I ONLY MET HIM ONCE...
WHEN I WAS THREE.

158
00:07:18,856 --> 00:07:20,941
WE VISITED HIM AT WORK.

159
00:07:21,024 --> 00:07:22,150
HE'S A DOCTOR AND IT DIDN'T
GO WELL.

160
00:07:22,234 --> 00:07:23,610
SPIKE:
I DIDN'T WANT EMMA
COMING HERE TODAY.

161
00:07:23,694 --> 00:07:25,404
SHANE:
WELL I JUST THINK THAT YOU'RE
TALKING ABOUT EMMA

162
00:07:25,487 --> 00:07:26,363
LIKE SHE CAN'T HEAR YOU
RIGHT NOW,

163
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:27,823
AND THAT WASN'T THE DEAL
AT ALL.

164
00:07:27,906 --> 00:07:28,991
SPIKE:
WELL YOU KNOW WHAT?

165
00:07:29,074 --> 00:07:30,200
I THINK IT'S A LITTLE CONFUSING
FOR HER,

166
00:07:30,284 --> 00:07:31,535
SO MAYBE YOU SHOULD THINK
ABOUT THAT.

167
00:07:31,618 --> 00:07:32,786
SHANE:
WELL I THINK SHE CAN HEAR
YOU RIGHT NOW

168
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:33,871
AND YOU'RE PRETENDING
SHE CAN'T,

169
00:07:33,954 --> 00:07:35,789
SO MAYBE WE CAN TALK ABOUT THIS
ANOTHER TIME.

170
00:07:35,873 --> 00:07:37,833
I REFUSE TO NOT BE INVOLVED
IN THIS CHILD'S LIFE!

171
00:07:37,916 --> 00:07:39,459
SHE NEEDS ME.

172
00:07:39,543 --> 00:07:42,254
ASHLEY:
SO HE'S NOT AROUND AT ALL?

173
00:07:42,337 --> 00:07:42,838
NEVER.

174
00:07:44,256 --> 00:07:48,886
BUT I LIKE TO LOOK AT THIS

THE OLD ROOM'S LOOKING
PRETTY GOOD, HUH?

180
00:08:04,026 --> 00:08:07,404
DID YOU CHANGE MY NAME
AT SCHOOL?

181
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:08,488
PARDON ME?

182
00:08:08,572 --> 00:08:09,364
TODAY DURING ATTENDANCE

183
00:08:09,448 --> 00:08:12,659
MS. HATZILAKOS SAID
EMMA SIMPSON.

184
00:08:12,743 --> 00:08:14,703
SPIKE:
I'M SURE IT WAS JUST
A MISTAKE, EM.

185
00:08:14,786 --> 00:08:17,206
THE OFFICE PROBABLY GOT
CONFUSED.

186
00:08:17,289 --> 00:08:20,042
HOW? UNLESS SNAKE SAID
SOMETHING.

187
00:08:20,584 --> 00:08:22,544
UH, NO. I MEAN UH,

188
00:08:22,628 --> 00:08:25,297
THE NEW SECRETARY DOES KNOW
YOU'RE MY DAUGHTER.

189
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:27,549
BUT I'M NOT YOUR DAUGHTER.

190
00:08:29,218 --> 00:08:30,886
EM, WHAT'S GOING ON?

191
00:08:31,637 --> 00:08:35,182
I'M HIS STEP-DAUGHTER.
I ONLY HAVE ONE DAD

192
00:08:35,265 --> 00:08:37,017
AND HE'S NOT HERE.

193
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:37,684

195
00:08:42,022 --> 00:08:44,525
HE'S HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH YOU
FOR TEN YEARS.

196
00:08:44,608 --> 00:08:48,362
ELEVEN... AND A LOT CAN CHANGE
IN ELEVEN YEARS.

197
00:08:48,445 --> 00:08:50,155
WHERE ARE YOU GOING WITH THIS?

198
00:08:50,239 --> 00:08:52,074
I DUNNO, I JUST THOUGHT IT
MIGHT BE NICE

199
00:08:52,157 --> 00:08:54,451
TO ACTUALLY KNOW WHO HE IS.

200
00:08:56,161 --> 00:08:57,079
OR WHERE?

201
00:08:57,162 --> 00:09:00,832
NO! I'M SORRY, BUT NO.
THAT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN.

214
00:09:34,992 --> 00:09:36,076
YOU DON'T NEED IT.

215
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:37,703
YOU CAN JUST BREATHE
RIGHT THROUGH THE PAIN.

216
00:09:37,786 --> 00:09:39,788
STILL, SPIKE,
AREN'T YOU SCARED?

217
00:09:39,872 --> 00:09:40,998
WHY WOULD I BE?

I NEEDED PARK PLACE

276
00:12:54,024 --> 00:12:55,692
BUT I DIDN'T HAVE
ENOUGH MONEY.

277
00:12:55,776 --> 00:12:57,444
SOUNDS FAMILIAR.

278
00:12:57,528 --> 00:12:59,863
ANYWAY, SHE NEEDED ATLANTIC,
WHICH MY DAD HAD,

279
00:12:59,947 --> 00:13:01,990
AND HE NEEDED VERMONT,
WHICH I HAD.

280
00:13:02,074 --> 00:13:02,950
SO...

281
00:13:03,033 --> 00:13:04,993

FINDING MY BIRTH DAD

296
00:13:35,315 --> 00:13:37,067
IS A LITTLE MORE IMPORTANT?

297
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:38,610
