00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:06,630
EMMA:

178
00:09:06,713 --> 00:09:09,716

186
00:09:37,703 --> 00:09:39,663

187
00:09:39,746 --> 00:09:40,414
EMMA:

JAY:
JUST A FEW CHOCOLATE BARS.

189
00:09:42,165 --> 00:09:42,875
BIG DEAL.

190
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:44,960
LOOK, WE'RE BANNED FOR LIFE.

191
00:09:45,043 --> 00:09:48,589

EMMA:
AND WHAT IS YOUR IDEA
OF FUN, JAY?

196
00:09:56,138 --> 00:09:57,931
STEALING THE SCHOOL'S DVD

197
00:09:58,015 --> 00:09:58,974
JAY:
LOADS.

198
00:09:59,516 --> 00:10:01,018
BUT STEALING A LAPTOP?

199
00:10:02,019 --> 00:10:03,437
WAY BETTER.

200
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:04,354
SEAN:
JAY.

201
00:10:06,523 --> 00:10:08,108
JAY:
WHAT'S SHE GONNA DO?

202
00:10:08,192 --> 00:10:10,319
IF SHE'S SMART,
SHE'LL SHUT UP FOR ONCE.

203
00:10:23,999 --> 00:10:26,251
WHAT'RE YOU DOING UP?

204
00:10:27,002 --> 00:10:28,921

00:10:29,004 --> 00:10:29,922
JACK WAKE YOU?

206
00:10:30,005 --> 00:10:32,799
NO. JACK'S A GOOD SLEEPER.

207
00:10:32,883 --> 00:10:35,219

NOT SO GOOD.

208
00:10:39,973 --> 00:10:41,308
OH, PLEASE. NOT AGAIN.

209
00:10:41,391 --> 00:10:42,851

210
00:10:42,935 --> 00:10:44,353
SIMPSON:
HEY, IT WAS THE BEST
YOUR MOM COULD AFFORD

211
00:10:44,436 --> 00:10:45,771
AND I'M TOUCHED.

212
00:10:46,939 --> 00:10:50,150
ALL IT NEEDS IS A LITTLE
FINE TUNING.

213
00:10:50,234 --> 00:10:51,693
I'LL UPGRADE THE RAM.

214
00:10:51,777 --> 00:10:53,070
EMMA:
SHE SHOULDN'T HAVE HAD TO BUY
YOU A NEW ONE

215
00:10:53,153 --> 00:10:55,155
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

216
00:10:55,239 --> 00:10:57,699
SIMPSON:
WELL, IF I HADN'T LOST
MY LAST ONE.

217
00:10:57,783 --> 00:10:59,368
EMMA:
YOU DIDN'T LOSE IT.

218
00:11:01,495 --> 00:11:02,704
SIMPSON:
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

219
00:11:02,788 --> 00:11:05,207
EMMA:
NOTHING.
I DON'T MEAN ANYTHING.

220
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:06,792
I'M JUST TIRED.

221
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:09,294
I'M GONNA GO HAVE A SHOWER,
OKAY?

222
00:11:09,378 --> 00:11:11,046
SIMPSON:

CHRIS:
EMMA, I GOT THE COOLEST CD

224
00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:29,481
WE NEED TO GET
THAT LAPTOP.

225
00:11:30,274 --> 00:11:31,066
WELL GOOD LUCK.

226
00:11:31,149 --> 00:11:32,734
THEY SOLD IT
THE DAY THEY STOLE IT.

227
00:11:32,818 --> 00:11:34,486
SO WHAT ARE WE
SUPPOSED TO DO?

228
00:11:34,570 --> 00:11:36,071
TELL MR. RADITCH?

229
00:11:36,154 --> 00:11:38,407
THAT JAY SORT OF,
KIND OF CONFESSED?

230
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:40,075
WE NEED PROOF.

231
00:11:40,158 --> 00:11:42,327

THEY'RE FOR SHOP.

257
00:13:23,303 --> 00:13:25,097
WHAT, DID YOU THINK THERE WAS
GONNA BE A DVD PLAYER IN THERE?

258
00:13:27,933 --> 00:13:30,644

SO I BLEW MY FIRST LESSON
WITH FALCONE.

265
00:13:54,751 --> 00:13:55,878
IT COULD HAPPEN TO ANYBODY.

266
00:13:55,961 --> 00:13:56,837

AH, BUT IT DIDN'T.

267
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:58,046

WHO THINKS SO.

277
00:14:20,319 --> 00:14:21,904

282
00:14:48,847 --> 00:14:51,767
SO, HOW ARE THINGS
GOING WITH EMMA?

283
00:14:52,851 --> 00:14:55,479

JT:
YEAH.

285
00:14:56,563 --> 00:14:59,983
I WOULDN'T WANT TO BE
HER NEXT BOYFRIEND.

286
00:15:00,609 --> 00:15:01,527
NO OFFENSE.

287
00:15:05,405 --> 00:15:06,573

TO DO SOMETHING.

289
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:14,665
CHRIS:
EMMA, I TOLD YOU,
THE COMPUTER'S LONG GONE.

290
00:15:14,748 --> 00:15:17,501
I KNOW, BUT THE DVD PLAYER
ISN'T.

291
00:15:18,502 --> 00:15:20,087
OKAY.
I WAS BEEN THINKING.

292
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:22,422
IF WE CAN GET RADITCH
TO SEARCH JAY'S CAR,

293
00:15:22,506 --> 00:15:25,050
WHO KNOWS WHAT
HE MIGHT FIND.

294
00:15:25,133 --> 00:15:27,803
IF I HELP,
YOU'LL LET THIS GO?

295
00:15:28,345 --> 00:15:29,179
I PROMISE.

I WANT TO CATCH WHOEVER
IS RESPONSIBLE.

297
00:15:35,644 --> 00:15:37,479
IF YOU KNOW ANYTHING,

298
00:15:37,563 --> 00:15:39,481
ALL TIPS ARE ANONYMOUS.

299
00:15:39,565 --> 00:15:41,650

302
00:15:43,861 --> 00:15:46,238
RADITCH:
OKAY. THE DVD PLAYER.

303
00:15:46,321 --> 00:15:47,990
WHEN DID YOU SEE THE CRIME
TAKE PLACE?

304
00:15:48,073 --> 00:15:49,950

SIMPSON'S COMPUTER?

348
00:18:09,131 --> 00:18:09,965
WHAT ABOUT IT?

349
00:18:10,048 --> 00:18:11,466
I THOUGHT THAT'S WHY
YOU DID ALL THIS.

350
00:18:11,550 --> 00:18:12,509
IT WAS.

351
00:18:12,593 --> 00:18:13,844
BUT NOW SEAN'S
FINALLY GONNA PAY

352
00:18:13,927 --> 00:18:16,638
FOR WHAT HE DID TO ME.

353
00:18:16,722 --> 00:18:19,474
OR SNAKE.
WHAT HE DID TO SNAKE.

354
00:18:19,558 --> 00:18:20,767
YOU LIED TO RADITCH.

355
00:18:20,851 --> 00:18:23,145
SO? EVERYBODY KNOWS
WHO'S BEEN STEALING.

356
00:18:23,228 --> 00:18:25,647
SEAN'S FINALLY GETTING
WHAT HE DESERVES.

357
00:18:25,731 --> 00:18:27,357
NO, HE ISN'T.

358
00:18:27,441 --> 00:18:30,235
JUST FACE IT EM,
YOU'RE NOT OVER HIM...

359
00:18:30,319 --> 00:18:31,278
CHRIS.

360
00:18:31,361 --> 00:18:33,864
AND I'M JUST WASTING
MY TIME.

361
00:18:40,537 --> 00:18:42,039
SPIKE:
HERE WE GO.

362
00:18:42,789 --> 00:18:43,874
SIMPSON:
WOW.

363
00:18:45,334 --> 00:18:46,543
THAT'S AWESOME.

364
00:18:49,630 --> 00:18:51,548
SPIKE:
HAPPY BIRTHDAY.

365
00:18:51,632 --> 00:18:53,133
MAKE A WISH.

366
00:18:56,053 --> 00:18:56,887
(CHEERING)

367
00:18:58,889 --> 00:19:02,809
OH, I FORGOT A KNIFE.
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

368
00:19:03,393 --> 00:19:05,187
HEY, HOW IS IT GOING, MAN?
THANKS FOR COMING.

369
00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:06,396
MAN:
HEY MAN, HAPPY BIRTHDAY.

370
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,232
SIMPSON:
SO, RUMOUR HAS IT YOUR NEW BEAU

371
00:19:08,315 --> 00:19:09,775
IS COMING BY THIS EVENING.

372
00:19:09,858 --> 00:19:11,318
UH, HE CAN'T MAKE IT.

373
00:19:11,401 --> 00:19:13,570
HE'S BUSY HATING
MY GUTS RIGHT NOW.

374
00:19:13,654 --> 00:19:16,698
TOTALLY MY FAULT -
I WENT PSYCHO.

375
00:19:16,782 --> 00:19:19,117
I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED
WITH YOU AND CHRIS,

376
00:19:19,201 --> 00:19:21,411
BUT IF HE'S WORTH HIS SALT,

377
00:19:21,495 --> 00:19:23,580
HE'LL CUT YOU SOME SLACK.

378
00:19:32,923 --> 00:19:34,550
I'M WORKING,
OKAY?

379
00:19:34,633 --> 00:19:36,260
AND EVERY DOLLAR I MAKE
FOR THE NEXT TEN YEARS

380
00:19:36,343 --> 00:19:39,429
GOES RIGHT TO FIXING
THAT STUPID CAR SO...

381
00:19:39,513 --> 00:19:42,307
SO PRETEND
I'M A CUSTOMER, OKAY?

382
00:19:42,391 --> 00:19:44,393
I'LL HAVE A CLUBHOUSE
SANDWICH,

383
00:19:44,476 --> 00:19:45,394
WITH A SIDE ORDER OF -

384
00:19:45,477 --> 00:19:46,395
SPINNER:
OF FALCONE?

385
00:19:48,063 --> 00:19:49,022
ANYWAY, I CAN'T TAKE YOUR
ORDER.

386
00:19:49,106 --> 00:19:51,191
I'M JUST THE DISHPIG,
REMEMBER?

387
00:19:51,275 --> 00:19:53,277
PAIGE:
BUT YOU'RE MY DISHPIG -

388
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:55,863
MY INSANELY JEALOUS DISHPIG.

389
00:19:55,946 --> 00:19:57,948
SPINNER:
I'M ONLY JEALOUS
'CAUSE I CARE.

390
00:19:58,031 --> 00:19:58,782
PAIGE:
I KNOW, HONEY.

391
00:19:58,866 --> 00:20:02,160
YOU PRACTICALLY DESTROYED
A CAR FOR ME.

392
00:20:03,537 --> 00:20:04,955
SPINNER:
SO, I GUESS YOU WON'T BE MAD

393
00:20:05,038 --> 00:20:08,083
WHEN YOU FIND OUT
I SWITCHED US BACK TO GONZALEZ?

394
00:20:08,166 --> 00:20:08,417
NO.

395
00:20:09,376 --> 00:20:11,628
ALTHOUGH I WILL MISS
THOSE DIMPLES,

396
00:20:11,712 --> 00:20:14,047
AND THAT CHISELED JAW.

397
00:20:15,883 --> 00:20:18,635
I'M KIDDING.
I'M TOTALLY KIDDING.

398
00:20:35,944 --> 00:20:39,156
I LOVE THAT ONE.
TRACK THREE.

399
00:20:39,239 --> 00:20:39,990
EM?

400
00:20:41,366 --> 00:20:43,410
I WAS HOPING
YOU'D BE HERE.

401
00:20:43,493 --> 00:20:43,994
LUCKY.

402
00:20:46,747 --> 00:20:49,750
I LIKE IT BETTER
WHEN YOU SMILE,

403
00:20:49,833 --> 00:20:52,211
AND I THINK YOU HAVE GREAT
TASTE IN HATS,

404
00:20:52,294 --> 00:20:54,922
AND EVEN BETTER TASTE
IN MUSIC...

405
00:20:55,464 --> 00:20:59,092
AND I LOVE IT THAT YOU
MAKE ME FEEL FUN AGAIN.

406
00:21:00,719 --> 00:21:03,096
I THINK YOU SHOULD
GIVE ME ANOTHER CHANCE.

407
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:04,556
YOU DO?

408
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:07,226
I PROMISE NEVER TO TALK
ABOUT SEAN AGAIN.

409
00:21:07,309 --> 00:21:08,268
YEAH?

410
00:21:09,269 --> 00:21:11,188
OKAY, ONCE MORE.

411
00:21:11,271 --> 00:21:15,317
ONLY TO SAY THAT
I ONLY DID WHAT I DID

412
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:18,111
BECAUSE HE BROKE MY HEART.

413
00:21:18,195 --> 00:21:20,656
IS IT FEELING
ANY BETTER?

414
00:21:20,739 --> 00:21:21,990
IT MIGHT...

415
00:21:22,866 --> 00:21:26,453
IF YOU'D COME OVER
FOR SOME BIRTHDAY CAKE.

416
00:21:26,537 --> 00:21:28,705
THAT'D BE NICE.
