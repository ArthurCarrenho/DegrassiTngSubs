1
00:00:03,712 --> 00:00:05,380
MARCO:
I CAN'T WAIT.

2
00:00:06,423 --> 00:00:08,008
RICK:
YOUR SEAT, M'LADY.

3
00:00:08,091 --> 00:00:11,386
TERRI:
WHY, THANK YOU.
YOU'RE SO SWEET.

4
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:15,182
KWAN:
SHHH. ALL RIGHT CLASS,

5
00:00:15,265 --> 00:00:17,684
TODAY WE'RE GOING TO START
OUR SCENE STUDIES.

6
00:00:17,768 --> 00:00:19,686
I WAS PLEASED THAT ONE GROUP

7
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:22,439
IS EVEN PERFORMING
AN ORIGINAL SCENE,

8
00:00:22,523 --> 00:00:25,150
WRITTEN BY OUR BUDDING
PLAYWRIGHT MARCO.

9
00:00:25,234 --> 00:00:27,569
SO, LET US START REHEARSING.

10
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:31,657
MARCO:
OKAY GUYS, SINCE I WROTE THIS,

11
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:33,742
I SORT OF DON'T FEEL
LIKE DIRECTING.

12
00:00:33,825 --> 00:00:34,535
JIMMY:
AND I DON'T WANT TO ACT.

13
00:00:34,618 --> 00:00:36,954
SO SAY HELLO TO YOUR
NEW DIRECTOR.

14
00:00:37,037 --> 00:00:39,039
WELL UH, NO OFFENCE, JIM,

15
00:00:39,122 --> 00:00:40,791
BUT THE THEATRE IS IN MY BLOOD.

16
00:00:40,874 --> 00:00:43,544
MY MOTHER WALKED THE BOARDS
AT STRATFORD FOR TEN YEARS.

17
00:00:43,627 --> 00:00:45,921
UM, WELL, MAYBE YOU CAN
STAGE MANAGE.

18
00:00:46,004 --> 00:00:47,714
ALL RIGHT.
WHO KNOWS?

19
00:00:47,798 --> 00:00:51,718
I MIGHT EVEN TEACH JIM
A FEW TRICKS OF THE TRADE.

20
00:00:51,802 --> 00:00:54,221
CASTING.
MARCO WILL PLAY RAY.

21
00:00:55,472 --> 00:00:57,057
HAZEL, WILL PLAY NURSE MEG,

22
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:59,893
AND OUR FEMALE LEAD WILL BE
PLAYED BY TERRI MACGREGOR.

23
00:00:59,977 --> 00:01:00,894
ME? REALLY?

24
00:01:05,607 --> 00:01:09,027
JIMMY:
COOL, SO LET'S GET STARTED.

25
00:01:09,111 --> 00:01:10,904
MAYBE I SHOULDN'T
PLAY THE LEAD.

26
00:01:10,988 --> 00:01:12,531
I COULD BE YOUR ASSISTANT.

27
00:01:12,614 --> 00:01:14,408
UH, NO, THANK YOU,
BUT-

28
00:01:14,491 --> 00:01:17,160
YOU'RE THE STAR.
YOU'LL BE BRILLIANT.

29
00:01:17,244 --> 00:01:19,413
THE STAGE MANAGER SAYS SO.

TERRI:

42
00:02:20,224 --> 00:02:21,350
JIMMY:
CUT!

43
00:02:21,433 --> 00:02:22,434
OKAY, TERRI?

44
00:02:23,185 --> 00:02:25,646
TRY TO BE A LITTLE MORE
NATURAL.

45
00:02:25,729 --> 00:02:28,065
I'M SORRY.
I'M JUST NERVOUS.

46
00:02:28,732 --> 00:02:29,816
JIMMY:
IT'S OKAY, THAT'S ALL RIGHT.

47
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:31,068
JUST TRY TO THINK ABOUT-

48
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:33,862
BREATHING. ALWAYS BREATHING.

49
00:02:33,946 --> 00:02:35,948
(BREATHING SOUNDS)

50
00:02:42,037 --> 00:02:45,415
JIMMY:
GREAT, THANKS. FROM THE TOP.

51
00:02:46,041 --> 00:02:46,959
MAMA?

52
00:02:51,296 --> 00:02:53,131
TERRI:
YES, SON...

53
00:02:55,092 --> 00:02:56,426
I AM HERE.

54
00:03:03,141 --> 00:03:06,103
OKAY GUYS, WE HAVE
A LOT OF WORK TO DO.

55
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:10,107
SO MEETING AT THE DOT
AFTER SCHOOL, OKAY?

56
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:13,694
IT'S HARD BEING
A FIRST-TIME DIRECTOR,

57
00:03:13,777 --> 00:03:16,029
BUT YOU'LL GET THERE.

58
00:03:19,825 --> 00:03:22,619
SPINNER:
SO MY BOSS HAS ME ON PROBATION
TO SEE IF I'LL WORK OUT

59
00:03:22,703 --> 00:03:24,454
AND MY FIRST CUSTOMER
GOES AND COMPLAINS.

60
00:03:24,538 --> 00:03:26,707
CRAIG:
SPIN, HE ORDERED A HAM SANDWICH

61
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:28,292
AND YOU BROUGHT HIM
A HAMBURGER.

62
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:29,710
SPINNER:
YEAH, BUT HE STILL ATE IT,

63
00:03:29,793 --> 00:03:32,588
AND HE DIDN'T EVEN LEAVE ME
A TIP, I MEAN LIKE-

64
00:03:32,671 --> 00:03:36,049
JT:
JUST THE DOG WAS JUST
LIKE LYING THERE.

65
00:03:36,133 --> 00:03:37,467
GREAT. JT AGAIN.

66
00:03:39,636 --> 00:03:42,055
JT WANTING PAIGE AROUND,
I CAN GET.

67
00:03:42,139 --> 00:03:44,558
BUT PAIGE WANTING JT AROUND?

68
00:03:44,641 --> 00:03:48,562
WELL, SHE HAD A HARD TIME LAST
YEAR AND JT WAS THERE FOR HER,

69
00:03:48,645 --> 00:03:50,689
SO SHE FEELS SHE OWES HIM.

70
00:03:50,772 --> 00:03:51,565
CRAIG:
BUT YOU DON'T.

71
00:03:51,648 --> 00:03:53,358
TELL HIM TO GET LOST.

72
00:03:55,861 --> 00:03:59,823
JT:
SO I SAID TO GAVIN,
WHOSE DOG IS IT ANYWAY?

73
00:04:00,574 --> 00:04:01,742
PAIGE:
HI, HON.

74
00:04:01,825 --> 00:04:02,242
SPINNER:
HI PAIGE.

75
00:04:02,326 --> 00:04:05,037
BYE JT. RUN ALONG NOW
AND JOIN THE OTHER CHILDREN.

76
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,581
BYE JT. RUN ALONG NOW
AND JOIN THE OTHER CHILDREN.

77
00:04:07,664 --> 00:04:09,333
SPINNER:
DUDE, DON'T.
I REALLY HATE THAT.

78
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:11,835
DUDE, DON'T.
I REALLY HATE THAT.

79
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:13,086
SPINNER:
THAT MAKES ME CRAZY.

80
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:14,630
THAT MAKES ME CRAZY.

81
00:04:14,713 --> 00:04:17,216
SPINNER:
JT, SHUT UP OR I'LL-

82
00:04:21,678 --> 00:04:23,764
NOT DO ANYTHING.

83
00:04:23,847 --> 00:04:26,600
GEEZ, MIGHT WANT TO CUT BACK
ON THE RED MEAT THERE, TIGER.

84
00:04:26,683 --> 00:04:29,603
EVER HEARD OF ANGER MANAGEMENT?

85
00:04:29,686 --> 00:04:32,314
PAIGE, WHEN ARE YOU GONNA
CUT YOUR LAPDOG LOOSE?

86
00:04:32,397 --> 00:04:34,441
SPIN, JUST GIVE HIM
A CHANCE, OKAY?

87
00:04:34,525 --> 00:04:36,360
TRY SOME MALE-BONDING.

88
00:04:43,408 --> 00:04:45,327
RICK:
SO HOW LONG HAVE
YOU KNOWN JIMMY?

89
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:47,329
HMM...
SINCE SEVENTH GRADE.

90
00:04:47,412 --> 00:04:48,539
GOOD FRIEND?

91
00:04:48,622 --> 00:04:50,541
SURE.
I LIKE HIM.

92
00:04:52,042 --> 00:04:54,294
BUT NOT LIKE THAT.

93
00:04:54,378 --> 00:04:55,879
YOU'RE THE ONLY GUY
I CARE ABOUT.

94
00:04:55,963 --> 00:04:56,672
YOU SURE?

95
00:04:56,755 --> 00:04:58,382
TERRI:
I'M POSITIVE.

96
00:04:58,465 --> 00:05:00,759
YOU MAKE ME SO HAPPY.

97
00:05:00,843 --> 00:05:02,469
HAPPIER THAN
I'VE EVER BEEN.

98
00:05:02,553 --> 00:05:05,138
YOU MAKE ME HAPPY, TOO,
M'LADY.

99
00:05:12,896 --> 00:05:14,356
COME ON, THEY'RE CUTE.

100
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:15,566
JIMMY:
THEY'RE NAUSEATING.

101
00:05:15,649 --> 00:05:17,276
NO. HE'S NAUSEATING.

102
00:05:17,359 --> 00:05:17,734
WHAT?

103
00:05:18,443 --> 00:05:20,070
WHAT RICK DOESN'T CREEP
YOU OUT?

104
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:21,488
HAZEL:
YEAH, HE'S A LITTLE STRANGE,

105
00:05:21,572 --> 00:05:22,823
BUT THEY'RE IN LOVE.

106
00:05:22,906 --> 00:05:24,491
AND HE'S TERRI'S FIRST
BOYFRIEND.

107
00:05:24,575 --> 00:05:25,742
SO DEAL, OKAY?

108
00:05:26,869 --> 00:05:28,787
SIMPSON:
GOOD MORNING ONE AND ALL.

109
00:05:28,871 --> 00:05:30,205
THE VIDEO ANNOUNCEMENTS
ARE DOWN THIS MORNING,

110
00:05:30,289 --> 00:05:35,627
SO I'LL BE READING THEM TO YOU
WITH THE OLD SCHOOL METHOD.

111
00:05:37,045 --> 00:05:38,505
RICK:
THE FIRST THING THAT ACTORS
ARE TAUGHT

112
00:05:38,589 --> 00:05:40,048
IS THE THREE QUARTER RULE.

113
00:05:40,132 --> 00:05:42,426
YOU MUST ALWAYS HAVE
THREE QUARTERS OF YOUR BODY

114
00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:43,677
FACING THE AUDIENCE.

115
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:44,428
OR WHAT?

116
00:05:45,387 --> 00:05:46,847
ONE, THE AUDIENCE
WON'T SEE YOU.

117
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:49,683
TWO, THE AUDIENCE
WON'T HEAR YOU.

118
00:05:50,267 --> 00:05:52,436
ALL RIGHT.
THANKS FOR THE TIP.

119
00:05:54,771 --> 00:05:56,815
SPINNER:
ALL RIGHT, IS EVERYONE READY?

120
00:05:56,899 --> 00:05:59,401
OH UM, I DON'T KNOW UM...

121
00:05:59,484 --> 00:06:00,402
WHAT ABOUT A BURGER?

122
00:06:00,485 --> 00:06:01,486
WHY NOT A SALAD?

123
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:03,197
YOU SAID YESTERDAY
YOU WERE CRAVING ONE.

124
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:06,366
DOES ANYONE REALLY
CRAVE SALAD?

125
00:06:07,534 --> 00:06:08,619
WHAT KIND SHOULD
I ORDER?

126
00:06:08,702 --> 00:06:10,746
GO FOR GARDEN.
LIGHT DRESSING.

127
00:06:10,829 --> 00:06:12,372
HEALTHIEST CHOICE
ON THE MENU.

128
00:06:12,456 --> 00:06:14,208
TERRI:
SOUNDS PERFECT.

129
00:06:14,291 --> 00:06:16,502
MAKE THAT TWO,
MY GOOD MAN.

130
00:06:16,585 --> 00:06:16,960
OKAY.

131
00:06:18,545 --> 00:06:21,798
YOU'RE ALWAYS LOOKING OUT
FOR ME.

132
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:30,224
MORNING MANNY,
LOOKING LOVELY AS USUAL.

133
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:36,980
RADITCH:
MR. YORKE.

134
00:06:38,482 --> 00:06:40,692
SOMETHING YOU WANT
TO TELL ME?

135
00:06:40,776 --> 00:06:41,693
UH, NO SIR.

136
00:06:42,653 --> 00:06:46,490
I FOUND THIS NOTE UNDER
MY OFFICE DOOR THIS MORNING.

137
00:06:46,573 --> 00:06:49,243
ROSES ARE RED,
VIOLETS ARE BLUE,

138
00:06:49,326 --> 00:06:52,371
MY NAME IS JT YORKE
AND I LOVE YOU.

139
00:06:52,454 --> 00:06:54,331
P.S. LOVE THE PANTS.

140
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:56,250
MR. RADITCH,
I DID NOT WRITE THAT.

141
00:06:56,333 --> 00:06:57,376
IT'S SOME KIND OF PRANK.

142
00:06:57,459 --> 00:06:59,628
I'M RELIEVED TO HEAR THAT.

143
00:07:06,969 --> 00:07:07,219
OH!

144
00:07:09,972 --> 00:07:11,515
SOMETHING WRONG
WITH YOUR LOCKER?

145
00:07:11,598 --> 00:07:12,432
UH NO, NO.

146
00:07:13,642 --> 00:07:16,228
IT'S FINE.
IT'S PERFECTLY FINE.

147
00:07:20,649 --> 00:07:22,150
SPINNER:
(LAUGHS)

148
00:07:22,234 --> 00:07:27,072
WELL, I GUESS YOU SHOULD ALWAYS
ACTUALLY LOCK YOUR LOCKER.

149
00:07:27,656 --> 00:07:29,449
THAT WAS YOU?

150
00:07:29,533 --> 00:07:30,659
I'M MALE-BONDING.

151
00:07:30,742 --> 00:07:32,744
DO ME A FAVOUR,
DON'T BOND ANYMORE, OKAY?

152
00:07:32,828 --> 00:07:35,372
BUT I ALWAYS BOND
WITH ALL MY FRIENDS.

153
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:37,791
OF COURSE IF YOU WOULD
STOP HANGING AROUND,

154
00:07:37,875 --> 00:07:39,501
I WOULDN'T HAVE TO.

155
00:07:40,002 --> 00:07:40,586
GET IT?

156
00:07:45,549 --> 00:07:45,924
MAMA!

157
00:07:53,557 --> 00:07:56,351
RAY, YOU MUSTN'T GIVE UP HOPE!

158
00:07:56,435 --> 00:07:57,853
JIMMY:
CUT!

159
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:00,022
WHAT'RE YOU DOING?

160
00:08:00,105 --> 00:08:02,274
YOU'RE TALKING STRAIGHT
TO THE AUDIENCE.

161
00:08:02,357 --> 00:08:04,693
IT'S THE THREE-QUARTER RULE.

162
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:07,905
RICK?

163
00:08:09,239 --> 00:08:10,616
CAN I STEAL YOU FOR A MINUTE?

164
00:08:10,699 --> 00:08:12,367
FOR YOU, I GOT FIVE.

165
00:08:13,452 --> 00:08:15,913
JIMMY:
LOOK, I REALLY APPRECIATE
YOUR HELP.

166
00:08:15,996 --> 00:08:18,290
BUT SOME OF YOUR TIPS
ARE GETTING IN THE WAY.

167
00:08:18,373 --> 00:08:19,416
UM, EXAMPLES?

168
00:08:20,584 --> 00:08:22,294
WELL, THE BREATHING?

169
00:08:22,377 --> 00:08:25,297
I MEAN, TERRI SOUNDS
LIKE SHE'S SMOKING.

170
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:26,798
AND THIS THREE-QUARTER RULE?

171
00:08:26,882 --> 00:08:28,133
OH I WAS ONLY TRYING TO HELP.
I'LL GO TALK WITH HER--

172
00:08:28,217 --> 00:08:30,010
NO, YOU KNOW WHAT?

173
00:08:30,093 --> 00:08:32,846
WE'RE GOING ON THIS AFTERNOON
SO I WILL

174
00:08:32,930 --> 00:08:34,973
BECAUSE I'M THE DIRECTOR.

175
00:08:40,604 --> 00:08:42,356
PAIGE:
ROSES ARE RED,
VIOLETS ARE BLUE,

176
00:08:42,439 --> 00:08:44,816
MY NAME IS JT YORKE
AND I LOVE YOU?

177
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:47,569
YEAH?
C'MON, IT'S CLASSIC!

178
00:08:49,738 --> 00:08:50,906
KIDS:
(LAUGHS)

179
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:55,160
JT:
OH YEAH!

180
00:08:56,453 --> 00:08:58,247
SPINNER:
WELL, THAT'S IT!

181
00:08:58,330 --> 00:08:59,081
JT:
YEAH!

182
00:09:01,375 --> 00:09:02,543
RICK:
CAUSE I'M THE DIRECTOR.

183
00:09:02,626 --> 00:09:04,628
CAN YOU BELIEVE HE ACTUALLY
SAID THAT TO ME?

184
00:09:04,711 --> 00:09:05,796
I'M SO SORRY.

185
00:09:06,672 --> 00:09:09,049
ONE, IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT
JIMMY IS A CONTROL FREAK.

186
00:09:09,132 --> 00:09:12,261
TWO, YOU DON'T HAVE
TO LISTEN TO HIM.

187
00:09:12,344 --> 00:09:15,389
I CAN'T JUST IGNORE
WHAT JIMMY WANTS.

188
00:09:15,472 --> 00:09:18,267
YOU'RE RIGHT.
HE IS THE DIRECTOR.

189
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:19,351
A NOVICE DIRECTOR

190
00:09:19,434 --> 00:09:20,853
THAT HAS ABSOLUTELY NO IDEA
WHAT HE'S DOING BUT-

191
00:09:20,936 --> 00:09:21,311
RICK.

192
00:09:22,271 --> 00:09:23,438
I'M SORRY BUT,

193
00:09:24,481 --> 00:09:25,482
I JUST DON'T WANT YOU
TO EMBARRASS YOURSELF

194
00:09:25,566 --> 00:09:28,026
IN FRONT OF ALL THOSE PEOPLE.

195
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:31,029
IT COULD BE SO HUMILIATING
FOR YOU.

196
00:09:31,655 --> 00:09:34,116
TERRI:
I WANT MY SON TO SEE
THE SUN RISE.

197
00:09:34,199 --> 00:09:36,535
HAZEL:
I'M AFRAID THAT WON'T HAPPEN.

198
00:09:36,618 --> 00:09:39,663
BUT IT MUST!
I WANT HIM TO LIVE.

199
00:09:39,746 --> 00:09:42,082
WHAT WE WANT,
ISN'T WHAT WE ALWAYS GET.

200
00:09:42,165 --> 00:09:45,752
AND WHAT WE GET,
ISN'T WHAT WE WANT, IS IT?

201
00:09:49,965 --> 00:09:50,966
MARCO:
MAMA?

202
00:09:52,384 --> 00:09:53,552
ARE YOU THERE?

203
00:09:57,222 --> 00:09:59,183
YES, SON.
MAMA IS HERE.

204
00:10:01,852 --> 00:10:03,353
MAMA IS HERE, RAY.

205
00:10:06,356 --> 00:10:08,984
MAMA WILL ALWAYS BE HERE.

206
00:10:11,695 --> 00:10:12,738
I AM YOUR ROCK...

207
00:10:12,821 --> 00:10:14,198
CLASS:
(LAUGHING)

208
00:10:14,823 --> 00:10:17,326
AND YOUR SHELTER
IN THE STORM.

209
00:10:19,536 --> 00:10:20,204
(LAUGHS)

210
00:10:41,934 --> 00:10:43,143
RICK:
SO WHAT FILM SHOULD WE SEE?

211
00:10:43,227 --> 00:10:45,395
THAT BRITISH IMPORT GOT
FABULOUS REVIEWS IN THE-

212
00:10:45,479 --> 00:10:47,397
TERRI:
ARE WE GONNA TALK ABOUT IT?

213
00:10:47,481 --> 00:10:48,815
RICK:
ABOUT WHAT?

214
00:10:48,899 --> 00:10:51,610
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED
IN THEATRE CLASS.

215
00:10:51,693 --> 00:10:53,070
WHAT'S THERE TO TALK ABOUT?

216
00:10:53,153 --> 00:10:55,364
I LOOKED LIKE AN IDIOT
BECAUSE OF YOU.

217
00:10:55,447 --> 00:10:56,907
EXCUSE ME?

218
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:58,116
EVERYONE WAS LAUGHING.

219
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,910
I SHOULD'VE LISTENED
TO JIMMY.

220
00:10:59,993 --> 00:11:00,661
WHAT?

221
00:11:00,744 --> 00:11:02,204
RICK:
LET ME MAKE ONE THING CLEAR.

222
00:11:02,287 --> 00:11:03,830
I DON'T LIKE THAT
TONE OF VOICE.

223
00:11:03,914 --> 00:11:05,624
IT MAKES ME FEEL STUPID,
ALL RIGHT?

224
00:11:05,707 --> 00:11:07,876
OKAY, SORRY.
RICK, LET GO.

225
00:11:08,877 --> 00:11:09,920
PLEASE.

226
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:33,944
RICK:
TERRI?

227
00:11:34,027 --> 00:11:36,530
TERRI, PLEASE.
JUST LOOK.

228
00:11:37,698 --> 00:11:38,866
FOR YOU.

229
00:11:39,533 --> 00:11:41,410
IT DOESN'T EXCUSE WHAT
HAPPENED, I KNOW.

230
00:11:41,493 --> 00:11:42,160
I FLEW OFF THE HANDLE.

231
00:11:42,244 --> 00:11:44,413
YOU DID WAY MORE THAN THAT.

232
00:11:44,496 --> 00:11:47,624
RICK:
WILL YOU LET ME APOLOGIZE?
PLEASE.

233
00:11:47,708 --> 00:11:49,585
I WAS JEALOUS OF JIM.

234
00:11:49,668 --> 00:11:50,919
HE HAS A THING FOR YOU.

235
00:11:51,003 --> 00:11:51,837
WHY ELSE DID HE CAST YOU
IN THE LEAD?

236
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,463
WE'RE FRIENDS.

237
00:11:53,547 --> 00:11:54,590
RICK:
AND HE'S SINGLE.

238
00:11:54,673 --> 00:11:56,300
HE DOESN'T LIKE ME
THAT WAY.

239
00:11:56,383 --> 00:11:58,385
TERRI, YOU'RE BEAUTIFUL.

240
00:12:00,554 --> 00:12:03,056
AND SMART AND SWEET,
TALENTED.

241
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:11,565
CAN YOU BLAME ME FOR THINKING
EVERY GUY LOVES YOU LIKE I DO?

242
00:12:26,663 --> 00:12:28,332
OH, WHAT'S THE OCCASION?

243
00:12:28,415 --> 00:12:30,501
NO OCCASION - JUST BECAUSE.

244
00:12:32,586 --> 00:12:34,546
WHAT'S WITH THIS GUY
AND THE ROSES?

245
00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:36,465
WHY?
YOU THINK IT'S WEIRD?

246
00:12:36,548 --> 00:12:39,051
TRY LUCKY.
HE TOTALLY SPOILS YOU.

247
00:12:39,134 --> 00:12:41,762
GUESS HE'S JUST
A BIG ROMANTIC.

248
00:12:41,845 --> 00:12:44,097
A BIG ROMANTIC WITH
A DISPOSABLE INCOME.

249
00:12:44,181 --> 00:12:45,349
THE BEST KIND.

250
00:12:46,266 --> 00:12:49,019
TER, YOU NEED TO FILL US
IN ON CETTE GRANDE ROMANCE.

251
00:12:49,102 --> 00:12:52,481
SO AFTER SCHOOL.
MY HOUSE, MAJOR DEBRIEFING.

252
00:12:52,564 --> 00:12:54,608
I SHOULD CHECK
WITH RICK FIRST.

253
00:12:54,691 --> 00:12:56,693
PLEASE, THE WAY YOU HAVE HIM
WRAPPED AROUND YOUR FINGER?

254
00:12:56,777 --> 00:13:00,030
I DON'T THINK
IT'LL BE A PROBLEM.

255
00:13:03,492 --> 00:13:06,912
HEY, WHAT HAPPENED
TO YOUR ARM?

256
00:13:06,995 --> 00:13:10,082
TERRI:
OH UH, VOLLEYBALL SERVE.

257
00:13:10,832 --> 00:13:13,126
ANOTHER REASON TO HATE GYM.

258
00:13:21,343 --> 00:13:23,095
SPINNER:
UH JT?

259
00:13:24,304 --> 00:13:26,139
I WANTED TO APOLOGIZE.

260
00:13:28,141 --> 00:13:28,725
YOU DO?

261
00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:32,104
YEAH, UM, PRANKING YOU
WAS IMMATURE.

262
00:13:32,187 --> 00:13:34,231
AND WELL, YOU GOT ME BACK.

263
00:13:34,314 --> 00:13:35,482
SO, IT'S OVER.

264
00:13:37,192 --> 00:13:39,361
OKAY,
I'M SORRY I PANTSED YOU.

265
00:13:39,444 --> 00:13:42,197
SPINNER:
HEY WHATEVER, I'M OVER IT.

266
00:13:42,281 --> 00:13:43,282
THING OF THE PAST.

267
00:13:43,365 --> 00:13:44,783
JT:
RIGHT, OKAY.

268
00:13:44,867 --> 00:13:45,909
ARE WE COOL?

269
00:13:45,993 --> 00:13:46,743
WE'RE GOOD.

270
00:13:46,827 --> 00:13:48,453
WE'RE GOOD.
YEAH, OKAY.

271
00:13:48,537 --> 00:13:49,830
ALL RIGHT. BYE.

272
00:13:50,539 --> 00:13:51,623
SPINNER:
BYE.

273
00:13:54,084 --> 00:13:55,085
JT:
HEY MANNY!

274
00:13:55,169 --> 00:13:56,170
MIGHT I SAY YOU'RE LOOKING
LOVELY TODAY?

275
00:13:56,253 --> 00:13:57,212
(FART SOUND)

276
00:13:57,296 --> 00:13:58,672
MANNY:
THANK YOU.

277
00:13:59,173 --> 00:14:00,507
DID YOU JUST...?

278
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:02,801
(MORE FARTING SOUNDS)

279
00:14:02,885 --> 00:14:04,052
NO, NO. THAT WASN'T,
THAT WASN'T ME.

280
00:14:04,136 --> 00:14:05,345
I DON'T KNOW, I DON'T KNOW
WHERE THAT'S COMING FROM.

281
00:14:05,429 --> 00:14:07,264
UGH.
JT, THAT'S GROSS!

282
00:14:08,515 --> 00:14:09,850
JT:
IT'S NOT ME!

283
00:14:09,933 --> 00:14:11,226
IT'S, IT'S NOT!

284
00:14:11,310 --> 00:14:13,896
MANNY:
THAT'S DISGUSTING.

285
00:14:14,813 --> 00:14:16,481
JT:
BUT IT'S NOT ME!

286
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:19,401
(CONTINUING FART SOUNDS)

287
00:14:29,453 --> 00:14:31,622
CRAIG:
OH MANNY! OH MANNY!

288
00:14:37,461 --> 00:14:38,212
RICK:
STRIKING THE SET,

289
00:14:38,295 --> 00:14:41,965
DEFINITELY THE WORST PART
OF STAGE MANAGING.

290
00:14:43,133 --> 00:14:46,720
HEY RICK, DO WE HAVE
ANYTHING AFTER SCHOOL?

291
00:14:47,346 --> 00:14:49,097
PAIGE INVITED ME AND HAZEL OVER

292
00:14:49,181 --> 00:14:51,683
FOR, FOR A GIRL'S NIGHT THING.

293
00:14:52,518 --> 00:14:53,852
SO, I CAN'T COME?

294
00:14:54,436 --> 00:14:57,189
WELL IT'S SORT OF
JUST FOR GIRLS.

295
00:14:57,898 --> 00:15:00,526
I UNDERSTAND WHAT GIRLS NIGHT
MEANS, TERRI.

296
00:15:00,609 --> 00:15:03,445
I JUST DON'T SEE WHY
YOU NEED ONE.

297
00:15:04,488 --> 00:15:06,657
IS IT SO YOU CAN TALK ABOUT ME?

298
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:07,449
WHAT? NO.

299
00:15:08,825 --> 00:15:10,369
SO YOU CAN PICK UP GUYS?

300
00:15:10,452 --> 00:15:10,744
NO!

301
00:15:11,662 --> 00:15:12,704
RICK:
THEN WHY CAN'T I COME?

302
00:15:12,788 --> 00:15:14,831
EXPLAIN IT TO ME BECAUSE
IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.

303
00:15:14,915 --> 00:15:16,959
RICK, YOU'RE BEING CRAZY.

304
00:15:19,837 --> 00:15:22,339
DON'T EVER CALL ME THAT.
EVER.

305
00:15:28,887 --> 00:15:30,889
TERRI, I'M SO SORRY.

306
00:15:42,484 --> 00:15:44,778
SPINNER:
HERE YOU GO.

307
00:15:46,488 --> 00:15:47,573
HELLO, GAVIN.

308
00:15:50,659 --> 00:15:53,161
JT, YOU'RE HERE TO EAT,
RIGHT?

309
00:15:54,037 --> 00:15:55,247
JT:
ABSOLUTELY.

310
00:15:55,330 --> 00:15:59,334
WHY WOULD I WANT TO CAUSE
TROUBLE FOR YOU AT WORK?

311
00:15:59,418 --> 00:16:01,587
I THINK I'LL HAVE
THE DOT-BURGER SUPREME,

312
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:04,756
PICKLES ON THE SIDE,
HOLD THE MAYO, TONS OF KETCHUP,

313
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:08,927
MUSTARD, DIJON,
NOT ON THE TOP BUN, BOTTOM BUN.

314
00:16:09,011 --> 00:16:11,763
AND SPEAKING OF BUNS TAKE THOSE
LITTLE SESAME SEEDS OFF THEM.

315
00:16:11,847 --> 00:16:13,557
I DON'T LIKE THEM GETTING
CAUGHT IN MY TEETH.

316
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:15,809
AND OF COURSE I WANT CHEESE.

317
00:16:15,893 --> 00:16:16,643
TERRI:
IT WAS AMAZING.

318
00:16:16,727 --> 00:16:19,855
HE COOKED DINNER,
FLOWERS, CANDLES.

319
00:16:19,938 --> 00:16:22,065
AND EVEN FOLDED THE NAPKINS
AS LITTLE FANS.

320
00:16:22,149 --> 00:16:24,109
THAT IS TOO CUTE.

321
00:16:25,027 --> 00:16:26,445
OKAY, WHO'S EATING
ALL THE GOOD STUFF

322
00:16:26,528 --> 00:16:27,905
AND LEAVING THE PRETZELS?

323
00:16:27,988 --> 00:16:30,949
I THOUGHT YOU LIKED
PRETZELS.

324
00:16:32,868 --> 00:16:33,827
HEY, YOU WANT ME TO DO
YOUR NAILS?

325
00:16:33,911 --> 00:16:34,828
SURE.

326
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,503
SO THINGS SOUND PRETTY
AMAZING WITH YOU AND RICK.

327
00:16:42,586 --> 00:16:44,588
NO PROBLEMS AT ALL?

328
00:16:44,671 --> 00:16:46,006
NOPE.
WHY?

329
00:16:47,966 --> 00:16:49,801
YOU NEVER FIGHT?

330
00:16:50,677 --> 00:16:51,678
SOMETIMES...

331
00:16:52,346 --> 00:16:54,264
ONLY WHEN
I HURT HIS FEELINGS.

332
00:16:54,348 --> 00:16:55,849
HE'S SO SENSITIVE.

333
00:16:57,768 --> 00:16:58,018
HM.

334
00:17:02,439 --> 00:17:05,025
TERRI, WHAT'S THAT ON YOUR LIP?

335
00:17:06,235 --> 00:17:08,070
IT'S JUST A COLD SORE.

336
00:17:09,154 --> 00:17:09,863
SO GROSS.

337
00:17:12,658 --> 00:17:14,243
SO THEN,
WHAT'S THIS?

338
00:17:14,326 --> 00:17:15,369
IT'S NOTHING.
JUST-

339
00:17:15,452 --> 00:17:16,870
I MEAN, IF HE'S HURTING YOU,

340
00:17:16,954 --> 00:17:18,705
YOU'D TELL ME, RIGHT?

341
00:17:19,206 --> 00:17:20,582
I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS.

342
00:17:20,666 --> 00:17:22,084
I'M JUST CONCERNED.

343
00:17:22,167 --> 00:17:23,669
YOU'RE JEALOUS.

344
00:17:23,752 --> 00:17:24,461
JEALOUS?

345
00:17:24,545 --> 00:17:26,088
TERRI:
NOBODY LOVES YOU
AND HE LOVES ME.

346
00:17:26,171 --> 00:17:27,714
AND YOU WANT TO TAKE THAT AWAY?

347
00:17:27,798 --> 00:17:28,882
PAIGE:
TERRI?

348
00:17:35,222 --> 00:17:37,975
I SAID CORN RELISH.
TAKE IT BACK.

349
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:42,646
THAT IS THE THIRD TIME.
THE BURGER IS FINE.

350
00:17:42,729 --> 00:17:43,814
EAT IT.

351
00:17:44,773 --> 00:17:46,525
THE CUSTOMER IS ALWAYS RIGHT.

352
00:17:46,608 --> 00:17:48,235
TAKE IT BACK.

353
00:17:53,824 --> 00:17:55,784
OOPSY-DAISIES.
SPOON FELL.

354
00:17:55,868 --> 00:17:58,704
BE A GOOD BOY,
GET ME A CLEAN ONE.

355
00:18:00,414 --> 00:18:03,500
JT, RUN ALONG HOME
BEFORE I GET MAD.

356
00:18:04,501 --> 00:18:07,629
JT, RUN ALONG HOME
BEFORE I GET MAD.

357
00:18:07,713 --> 00:18:09,882
DON'T DO THAT.
IT MAKES ME INSANE!

358
00:18:09,965 --> 00:18:11,842
DON'T DO THAT.
IT MAKES ME INSANE!

359
00:18:11,925 --> 00:18:12,926
SPINNER:
JT!

360
00:18:21,101 --> 00:18:23,854
MANAGER:
GAVIN, IN MY OFFICE NOW!

361
00:18:37,826 --> 00:18:40,162
RICK, WHAT'RE YOU DOING HERE?

362
00:18:40,245 --> 00:18:40,954
I WAS WAITING FOR YOU
TO COME HOME.

363
00:18:41,038 --> 00:18:42,414
I HAVE SOMETHING TO TELL YOU.

364
00:18:42,497 --> 00:18:43,874
WELL, NOW'S NOT A GOOD TIME.

365
00:18:43,957 --> 00:18:46,877
I WANTED TO TELL YOU
THAT I LOVE YOU.

366
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,962
AND THAT YOU'RE SPECIAL.

367
00:18:51,465 --> 00:18:53,509
THAT'S REALLY SWEET,
RICK.

368
00:18:53,592 --> 00:18:55,260
BUT I NEED TO BE ALONE.

369
00:18:55,344 --> 00:18:56,345
ME AND HAZEL HAD A FIGHT.

370
00:18:56,428 --> 00:18:58,096
RICK:
WELL, ONE,
I'M NOT SURPRISED.

371
00:18:58,180 --> 00:18:59,890
TWO, LET'S MAKE A RULE.

372
00:18:59,973 --> 00:19:03,685
YOU SEE HAZEL AND PAIGE
IN SCHOOL, ONLY.

373
00:19:03,769 --> 00:19:05,771
I NEED TO GO.
I NEED TO THINK.

374
00:19:05,854 --> 00:19:07,231
ABOUT WHAT?
LEAVING ME?

375
00:19:07,314 --> 00:19:08,941
I DON'T WANT TO, RICK.
I LOVE YOU.

376
00:19:09,024 --> 00:19:12,444
IT JUST THAT YOU'RE
SUFFOCATING ME!

377
00:19:16,156 --> 00:19:18,116
I'M SORRY, TERRI.
THAT WAS-

378
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:21,620
THAT WAS THE LAST TIME
YOU EVER TOUCH ME.

379
00:19:36,468 --> 00:19:37,928
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

380
00:19:38,011 --> 00:19:39,096
TO APOLOGIZE.

381
00:19:40,931 --> 00:19:43,433
LOOK, I'M SERIOUS,
SPINNER.

382
00:19:43,517 --> 00:19:45,519
PAIGE TOLD ME THAT
YOUR BOSS DEMOTED YOU.

383
00:19:45,602 --> 00:19:47,688
YEAH, TO DISHPIG.
THANKS.

384
00:19:49,815 --> 00:19:53,902
WELL THANKS FOR HUMILIATING ME
IN FRONT OF MANNY.

385
00:19:53,986 --> 00:19:56,446
I THINK OUR WAR'S GONE
FAR ENOUGH, HM?

386
00:19:56,530 --> 00:19:59,074
WHAT DO YOU SAY
TO A PEACE SETTLEMENT?

387
00:19:59,157 --> 00:19:59,533
FINE.

388
00:20:00,409 --> 00:20:03,036
IF YOU STOP CROWDING ME
AND PAIGE ALL THE TIME.

389
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:07,875
OKAY, IF YOU STOP TREATING ME
LIKE I'M SOME HUMAN PLAGUE.

390
00:20:08,375 --> 00:20:08,750
DONE.

391
00:20:10,377 --> 00:20:10,794
DONE.

392
00:20:17,885 --> 00:20:19,928
WORKING OUT
YOUR DIFFERENCES?

393
00:20:20,012 --> 00:20:23,515
YEAH, SOMETHING LIKE THAT,
HONEYBEE.

394
00:20:25,309 --> 00:20:25,809
GAVIN.

395
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:30,147
IF ONLY YOU COULD APPLY THIS
PASSION TO YOUR POEMS IN CLASS.

396
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:33,150
O MISS KWAN YOUR HAIR,
KISSED BY THE WIND

397
00:20:33,233 --> 00:20:35,235
YOUR LIPS, KISSED BY ME,

398
00:20:36,153 --> 00:20:37,321
SPINNER MASON.

399
00:20:40,365 --> 00:20:41,992
LET ME SEE THAT.

400
00:20:42,075 --> 00:20:43,619
LOOK I MEAN IT, TERRI.

401
00:20:43,702 --> 00:20:44,661
IF THIS GUY EVER
BOTHERS YOU AGAIN,

402
00:20:44,745 --> 00:20:45,913
LET ME KNOW, OKAY?

403
00:20:45,996 --> 00:20:47,581
THANKS, JIMMY.

404
00:20:49,708 --> 00:20:51,710
I JUST FEEL
SO STUPID.

405
00:20:51,793 --> 00:20:52,753
HE WAS YOUR FIRST
BOYFRIEND.

406
00:20:52,836 --> 00:20:54,338
YOU WANTED IT
TO WORK OUT.

407
00:20:54,421 --> 00:20:55,923
PROBABLY MY LAST.

408
00:20:56,006 --> 00:20:57,257
YOU'LL FIND SOMEONE ELSE,
TER.

409
00:20:57,341 --> 00:20:59,051
WHEN YOU'RE READY.

410
00:20:59,134 --> 00:21:00,135
IF I'M EVER.

411
00:21:01,428 --> 00:21:04,932
THE TERRIBLE PART IS
I STILL CARE FOR HIM.

412
00:21:05,641 --> 00:21:06,850
BUT YOU HAVE TO STOP.

413
00:21:06,934 --> 00:21:08,685
YOU KNOW THAT, RIGHT?

414
00:21:23,408 --> 00:21:24,076
I KNOW.
