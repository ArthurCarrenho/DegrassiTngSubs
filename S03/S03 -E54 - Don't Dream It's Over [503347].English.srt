00:01:44,062 --> 00:01:45,439
SO, FIND YOURSELF
A NEW PARTNER

39
00:01:45,522 --> 00:01:47,858
AND DECIDE WHO'S "A"

40
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:49,776
OKAY, LET'S BREAK UP
INTO GROUPS.

00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:56,033

47
00:02:09,713 --> 00:02:12,799
AND I WANT YOU TO TURN YOUR
BACKS TO "B"'S LIKE THIS.

48
00:02:12,883 --> 00:02:14,676
"B"'S OPEN UP YOUR ARMS,

49
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:19,515
CAUSE THE "A"'S ARE GONNA
FALL BACK INTO YOUR ARMS.

50

PAIGE:

52
00:02:24,645 --> 00:02:27,272
DO YOU HONESTLY THINK
I'M GONNA DROP YOU?

53
00:02:27,356 --> 00:02:28,899
BECAUSE I'M NOT.

54
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:30,484
TRUST ME.

(BELL RINGS)

57
00:02:47,709 --> 00:02:49,795
I'M JUST DESPERATE
FOR A REAL OPPORTUNITY

58
00:02:49,878 --> 00:02:51,880
TO DEVELOP OUR REAL
ACTING SHOPS.

59
00:02:51,964 --> 00:02:52,881
WELL, WE DID DO
MARCO'S PLAY.

60
00:02:52,965 --> 00:02:54,842
OKAY, I DON'T MEAN LIKE
AMATEURISH THEATRICS,

61
00:02:54,925 --> 00:02:58,554
I MEAN THE CLASSICS.
LIKE BRECHT, OR IBSEN.

62
00:02:58,637 --> 00:02:59,721
HEY THERE'S A MIME
UNIT NEXT WEEK.

63
00:02:59,805 --> 00:03:01,515

00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:05,185
MORE PEOPLE WALKING

65
00:03:06,937 --> 00:03:09,189
I WANTED TO CALL YOU...

66
00:03:09,773 --> 00:03:11,441
SO MANY TIMES.

67
00:03:12,526 --> 00:03:14,653
I JUST DIDN'T KNOW
WHAT TO SAY

68
00:03:14,736 --> 00:03:16,655
EXCEPT I'M SORRY -

69
00:03:17,573 --> 00:03:20,117
FOR MY TEMPER
AND WHAT I DID.

70
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,870
I NEVER MEANT
TO HURT YOU.

71
00:03:25,622 --> 00:03:27,666
LOOK, I MISSED YOU.

00:03:29,668 --> 00:03:31,545
I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN.

73
00:03:31,628 --> 00:03:33,839
IT WAS ALL MY FAULT,

74
00:03:33,922 --> 00:03:37,676
BUT IF THERE'S ANY,
ANY WAY THAT YOU THINK-

75
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:40,804

MARCO:
UM, JUST SO YOU KNOW,
MR. SIMPSON?

79
00:03:52,482 --> 00:03:54,902

00:03:54,985 --> 00:03:56,737
WE'RE ALL GLAD
TO HAVE YOU BACK.

81
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:57,821
(APPLAUSE)

82
00:03:57,905 --> 00:03:59,573
AW, JUST SO YOU KNOW,

83
00:03:59,656 --> 00:04:02,743
APPLAUSE WILL NOT IMPROVE
YOUR GRADE...

84
00:04:02,826 --> 00:04:04,161
BY MORE THAN
A FEW PERCENT.

85
00:04:06,496 --> 00:04:08,040
MARCO:

91
00:04:18,842 --> 00:04:20,928

ELLIE:
SO?

95
00:04:26,141 --> 00:04:28,644
DOESN'T MEAN THINGS
CHANGE WITH MY FRIENDS.

96
00:04:28,727 --> 00:04:32,356
ASHLEY:
CHANGE ISN'T AUTOMATICALLY
BAD, EL.

97
00:04:37,945 --> 00:04:39,947
CAITLIN ON TV:

101
00:04:46,578 --> 00:04:48,455
CAITLIN:
I ALWAYS CRINGE
AT MYSELF ON TAPE.

102
00:04:48,539 --> 00:04:52,709
CAITLIN ON TV:
WE'VE GOT TO ASK OURSELVES,
JUST WHO'S WATCHING?

103
00:04:52,793 --> 00:04:56,421
DON'T ALLOW YOURSELF TO BE
LULLED INTO BLIND ACCEPTANCE.

104
00:04:56,505 --> 00:04:58,131
SECURITY CAMERAS?

105
00:04:58,215 --> 00:05:01,927
I THOUGHT TAPE RECORDERS
WERE THE NEXT BIG THING.

106
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:05,264

112
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:19,987
IT'S THE OPENING WEEKEND
OF "ELIMINATION ROUND THREE".

113
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:21,321
IT'S A MOVIE -

114
00:05:21,405 --> 00:05:22,281
AN ACTION FRANCHISE.

115
00:05:22,364 --> 00:05:22,865
DO- DO YOU WANNA-

116
00:05:22,948 --> 00:05:23,782
YES.

117
00:05:24,867 --> 00:05:27,244
YOU CAN TAKE
YOUR TIME.

118
00:05:28,078 --> 00:05:29,246
OH, BUT-

119
00:05:30,122 --> 00:05:32,749
WHAT?
IS THERE A PROBLEM?

120
00:05:33,417 --> 00:05:35,169
NO.

121
00:05:35,252 --> 00:05:37,045
THAT WOULD BE...
NICE.

122
00:05:44,803 --> 00:05:48,724
SPINNER:
ANYWAY, WHATEVER YOU DO,
DON'T ORDER CHILI.

123
00:05:48,807 --> 00:05:51,768
TERRI:
HEY GUYS.
SORRY I'M SO LATE.

124
00:05:52,728 --> 00:05:54,438
RICK:
SO TERRI CAN I BUY YOU
A LATTE?

125
00:05:54,521 --> 00:05:58,025
TERRI:
SO SWEET.
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

126
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,112
I MUST BE HALLUCINATING.

127
00:06:02,196 --> 00:06:03,197
I HOPE SO.

128
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,616
PAIGE:
I SO WILL REFUSE TO DRIVE
THAT FREAK AROUND ALL DAY.

129
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:06,533
SPINNER:
PAIGE, NO-

130
00:06:06,617 --> 00:06:07,618
SPIN, SHE'S RIGHT.

131
00:06:07,701 --> 00:06:10,287
YEAH, BUT IF WE LEAVE
HIM BEHIND,

132
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:12,623
GUARANTEED WE LEAVE HER
BEHIND, TOO.

133
00:06:12,706 --> 00:06:14,374
WITHOUT ANY OF US
TO LOOK OUT FOR HER.

134
00:06:14,458 --> 00:06:17,836
AND THEN IT'S OPEN SEASON
FOR RICK AGAIN.

135
00:06:22,841 --> 00:06:23,717
ELLIE:
MARCO, COME ON.

136
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:26,053
MARCO:

137
00:06:26,136 --> 00:06:28,722

YOU KNOW WHAT,

142
00:06:38,482 --> 00:06:39,233
I'M HUNGRY.

143
00:06:39,316 --> 00:06:40,817
WHY DON'T YOU GO
GET ME SOME POPCORN?

144
00:06:40,901 --> 00:06:42,319
GIVE ME TWENTY BUCKS
AND I WILL.

145
00:06:49,785 --> 00:06:52,287
I ALREADY HAD PLANS
WITH MARCO,

146
00:06:52,371 --> 00:06:54,998
SO I THOUGHT I'D ASK HIM.

147
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:58,836
IS THERE A PROBLEM?

148
00:07:00,045 --> 00:07:01,338
LET'S GET SEATS.

149
00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:21,692

00:07:31,410 --> 00:07:32,828
RICK:

153
00:07:32,911 --> 00:07:33,912
PAIGE:
UH, RICK, I WOULD RATHER YOU

154
00:07:33,996 --> 00:07:36,248
NOT DENT MY PARENTS VAN

155
00:07:36,331 --> 00:07:37,165
I'M NOT HURTING IT.

156
00:07:37,249 --> 00:07:38,625
TERRI:
RICK?

157
00:07:38,709 --> 00:07:41,044
COME SIT OVER HERE,

158
00:07:48,844 --> 00:07:50,304

00:07:50,387 --> 00:07:52,890
YEAH,

160
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,894

00:07:58,395 --> 00:08:00,647
ELLIE AND MARCO:

162
00:08:02,816 --> 00:08:03,817

164
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:23,921
TERRI:
OKAY.

165
00:08:28,717 --> 00:08:30,260
PAIGE:
HEY, WANT TO PLAY
FRISBEE WITH US?

166
00:08:30,344 --> 00:08:33,180
I NEED TO SHOW SPIN
A THING OR TWO.

167
00:08:33,263 --> 00:08:34,806
MAYBE LATER.

168
00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:36,934
RICK WANTS TO TALK.

169
00:08:37,851 --> 00:08:39,853
YOU KNOW, YOU SHOULD

173
00:08:47,361 --> 00:08:48,737
SO WHAT, YOU'VE JUST
FORGIVEN CREEP-BOY

174
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:49,863
FOR BEATING YOU UP?

175
00:08:49,947 --> 00:08:51,448
HE APOLOGIZED.

176
00:08:51,532 --> 00:08:53,325
OF COURSE.
HIS TYPE ALWAYS DOES

177
00:08:53,408 --> 00:08:55,369
SO THEY CAN GET ANOTHER
SHOT IN AT YOU.

178
00:08:55,452 --> 00:08:56,745
RICK:
ONE, YOU HAVE NO RIGHT
TO DICTATE

179
00:08:56,828 --> 00:08:58,080
WHO TERRI'S FRIENDS ARE.

180
00:08:58,163 --> 00:09:00,374
AND TWO, YOU'RE A VICIOUS
BACK-STABBER.

181
00:09:00,457 --> 00:09:01,625
OH, I'M VICIOUS?

182
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:03,335
EVERYTHING YOU SAY
IS A JUDGMENT.

183
00:09:03,418 --> 00:09:05,212
YOU THINK YOU'RE SO PERFECT.

184
00:09:05,295 --> 00:09:06,797
PAIGE:
WHAT?

185
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:10,133
WELL, I'D RATHER BE THAT
THAN A PSYCHO.

186
00:09:17,766 --> 00:09:19,101
RICK'S RIGHT.

187
00:09:19,184 --> 00:09:20,769
I'M SO TIRED OF YOU
PUSHING ME AROUND,

188
00:09:20,853 --> 00:09:23,397
TELLING ME WHAT TO DO.
I'M SICK OF IT!

189
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:24,231
FINE.

190
00:09:24,314 --> 00:09:26,817
IF I'M SUCH A BAD FRIEND,
GO AFTER HIM.

191
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:27,651
GO!

192
00:09:47,713 --> 00:09:49,715
I'M SO SORRY
ABOUT PAIGE.

193
00:09:49,798 --> 00:09:52,301
IT DOES NOT MATTER.
SHE DOES NOT MATTER!

194
00:09:52,384 --> 00:09:54,887
PLEASE, RICK.
CALM DOWN.

195
00:09:56,138 --> 00:09:58,390
I'M SORRY.
I'M SORRY.

196
00:09:59,308 --> 00:10:02,019
I'M JUST-
I'M JUST SO HAPPY.

197
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:07,441
YOU KNOW, JUST-
WE'RE TOGETHER AGAIN.

198
00:10:14,364 --> 00:10:17,201
WE WERE MADE
FOR EACH OTHER.

199
00:10:18,869 --> 00:10:21,371
COME BACK.
WE'LL IGNORE PAIGE-

200
00:10:21,455 --> 00:10:22,873
NO. NO, LET'S WALK.

201
00:10:22,956 --> 00:10:24,416
IT'S REALLY FAR.

202
00:10:24,499 --> 00:10:27,211
SHE CALLED ME
A PSYCHO.

203
00:10:27,294 --> 00:10:30,297
THAT'S JUST PAIGE
BEING PAIGE.

204
00:10:32,883 --> 00:10:34,968
THAT MAKES IT OKAY?

205
00:10:35,761 --> 00:10:38,722
MY FEELINGS MEAN
NOTHING TO YOU?

206
00:10:38,805 --> 00:10:39,723
WHOA!

207
00:10:41,767 --> 00:10:42,726
RICK.

208
00:10:43,227 --> 00:10:46,063
DON'T YOU DARE CHOOSE
PAIGE OVER ME AGAIN.

209
00:10:46,146 --> 00:10:47,564
DON'T YOU DARE!

210
00:10:47,648 --> 00:10:49,399
I'M GOING BACK, OKAY?

211
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:51,818
YOU C-C-C-CAN'T LEAVE,
DO YOU UNDERSTAND?

212
00:10:51,902 --> 00:10:54,321
RICK,
YOU'RE HURTING ME!

213
00:10:54,404 --> 00:10:55,989
YOU'RE NOT GOING!
YOU'RE NOT!

214
00:10:56,073 --> 00:10:58,492
YOU'RE NOT!
YOU'RE NOT!

215
00:11:04,122 --> 00:11:05,541
(FRIGHTENED GASP)

216
00:11:11,713 --> 00:11:15,300
HAZEL:
THAT WAS AN EVEN STUPIDER MOVIE.

217
00:11:17,845 --> 00:11:19,596
EARTH TO PAIGE.

218
00:11:20,138 --> 00:11:22,224
TERRI'S NOT BACK
YET.

219
00:11:22,307 --> 00:11:23,141
NO?

220
00:11:26,478 --> 00:11:28,146
BE RIGHT BACK.

221
00:11:33,777 --> 00:11:37,364
SPINNER:
THERE'S RICK.
MAYBE TERRI'S...

222
00:11:38,115 --> 00:11:39,449
PAIGE:
OH MY GOD!

223
00:11:39,533 --> 00:11:40,534
TERRI!

224
00:11:43,287 --> 00:11:43,787
TERRI!

225
00:11:47,666 --> 00:11:50,294
TERRI!
OKAY, GET YOUR CELL NOW!

226
00:11:51,712 --> 00:11:54,173
PLEASE, TERRI, WAKE UP.
PLEASE.

227
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:03,849
OH MY GOD, TERRI!
TERRI, PLEASE.

228
00:12:08,353 --> 00:12:09,938
RADITCH:
AND FINALLY...

229
00:12:10,022 --> 00:12:11,148
AS SOME OF YOU MAY KNOW,

230
00:12:11,231 --> 00:12:12,816
TERRI MACGREGOR
IS IN THE HOSPITAL

231
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:17,571
WITH INJURIES THAT SHE
SUSTAINED OVER THE WEEKEND.

232
00:12:18,197 --> 00:12:20,157
AND I KNOW I SPEAK
FOR ALL OF DEGRASSI

233
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:23,285
WHEN I WISH HER A SPEEDY
RECOVERY.

234
00:12:23,368 --> 00:12:24,203
THANK YOU.

235
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:27,122
MARCO:
UH, SIR?

236
00:12:27,664 --> 00:12:30,125
WAS IT, LIKE,
AN ACCIDENT OR-

237
00:12:30,209 --> 00:12:32,127
SPINNER:
IT WAS NO ACCIDENT.

238
00:12:32,211 --> 00:12:34,838
ASHLEY:
SO, THEN IS RICK IN JAIL?

239
00:12:34,922 --> 00:12:36,632
SIMPSON:
I KNOW EVERYONE'S UPSET,

240
00:12:36,715 --> 00:12:38,467
BUT WE'RE NOT ALLOWED
TO TALK DETAILS.

241
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:40,469
SPINNER:
YEAH, OKAY, I WAS THERE.
I KNOW WHAT HAPPENED.

242
00:12:40,552 --> 00:12:41,053
GAVIN.

243
00:12:41,845 --> 00:12:43,972
SPINNER:
IF RICK STEPS ONE FOOT
IN DEGRASSI,

244
00:12:44,056 --> 00:12:45,641
HE'LL BE THE ONE
IN INTENSIVE CARE.

245
00:12:45,724 --> 00:12:48,310
SIMPSON:
THOSE INVOLVED WERE MINORS,
SO ONCE AGAIN,

246
00:12:48,393 --> 00:12:50,229
WE CAN'T TALK DETAILS.

247
00:12:51,313 --> 00:12:53,607
WHAT WE CAN DO IS DISCUSS
OUR FEELINGS TOGETHER.

248
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:55,234
WHY SHOULD WE PROTECT
THAT PIECE OF-

249
00:12:55,317 --> 00:12:59,154
WE CAN BRAINSTORM
WHAT WE CAN DO FOR TERRI.

250
00:12:59,238 --> 00:13:00,822
ANY THOUGHTS?

251
00:13:00,906 --> 00:13:02,741
PAIGE:
WE MADE A CARD.

252
00:13:02,824 --> 00:13:04,326
WE THOUGHT EVERYBODY
COULD SIGN IT .

253
00:13:04,409 --> 00:13:07,246
SIMPSON:
THAT'S A GREAT IDEA, PAIGE.
THANKS.

254
00:13:07,329 --> 00:13:09,748
WHY DON'T YOU PASS IT
AROUND.

255
00:13:17,756 --> 00:13:19,633
ELLIE:
I COULD GO WITH ASH,

256
00:13:19,716 --> 00:13:22,511
BUT I DIDN'T REALLY
KNOW TERRI.

257
00:13:22,594 --> 00:13:24,179
FEELS MORBID.

258
00:13:24,805 --> 00:13:28,559
MARCO:
WELL, WE CAN GO TOGETHER,
IF YOU WANT.

259
00:13:36,775 --> 00:13:38,026
SEAN:
HEY.

260
00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:39,444
ELLIE:
HI.

261
00:13:42,281 --> 00:13:42,781
MARCO?

262
00:13:43,949 --> 00:13:45,450
MARCO:
LOOK, IT'S FINE.

263
00:13:45,534 --> 00:13:47,953
I'LL JUST SEE YOU
IN ENGLISH.

264
00:13:50,706 --> 00:13:51,623
SEAN:
WHAT?

265
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:55,169
I JUST WANTED TO SPEND
TIME ALONE.

266
00:13:55,252 --> 00:13:56,920
GOT YOUR WISH.

267
00:14:25,741 --> 00:14:28,493
MR. MCGREGOR:
HEY PAIGE. SPINNER.

268
00:14:29,286 --> 00:14:30,579
WHAT YOU GOT THERE?

269
00:14:30,662 --> 00:14:34,082
PAIGE:
IT'S A CARD FOR TERRI.
THE SCHOOL SIGNED IT.

270
00:14:34,166 --> 00:14:36,084
MR. MCGREGOR:
OH, THAT'S GREAT.

271
00:14:36,168 --> 00:14:36,793
THANKS.

272
00:14:37,628 --> 00:14:39,004
THANKS FOR COMING.

273
00:14:39,087 --> 00:14:40,589
PAIGE:
HOW IS SHE?

274
00:14:41,089 --> 00:14:42,174
SURGERY TONIGHT.

275
00:14:42,257 --> 00:14:44,259
THEY FOUND A BLOOD CLOT.

276
00:14:47,012 --> 00:14:48,931
BUT SHE'S GONNA
BE OKAY?

277
00:14:49,014 --> 00:14:50,724
IT'S A BIG OPERATION.

278
00:14:51,433 --> 00:14:54,686
BUT HEY YEAH,
SHE'S GONNA PULL THROUGH.

279
00:14:54,770 --> 00:14:57,439
SHE'S A FIGHTER,
MY LITTLE BABY.

280
00:14:58,941 --> 00:15:01,401
HOW COULD ANYBODY
DO THIS TO HER?

281
00:15:01,485 --> 00:15:02,653
PAIGE:
I KNOW.

282
00:15:03,195 --> 00:15:05,113
MR. MCGREGOR:
RICK.

283
00:15:05,197 --> 00:15:08,867
I MEAN, TERRI WAS OVER
THE MOON FOR THE GUY.

284
00:15:11,328 --> 00:15:11,703
WHAT?

285
00:15:13,539 --> 00:15:15,832
YOU KNEW HE WAS ABUSIVE?

286
00:15:15,916 --> 00:15:17,960
SPINNER:
NO, MR. MCGREGOR...

287
00:15:18,043 --> 00:15:19,127
FOR HOW LONG?

288
00:15:20,462 --> 00:15:22,589
WE TRIED TO TALK TO HER.

289
00:15:22,673 --> 00:15:23,966
WHAT ABOUT ME?

290
00:15:24,049 --> 00:15:26,134
WHY DIDN'T YOU TO TALK TO ME?

291
00:15:26,218 --> 00:15:28,887
WE THOUGHT IT WAS UNDER
CONTROL.

292
00:15:29,805 --> 00:15:32,724
YOU STILL THINK
IT'S UNDER CONTROL?

293
00:16:04,214 --> 00:16:06,800
HEY, SHE'S GONNA
BE OKAY.

294
00:16:21,106 --> 00:16:22,482
WHAT? WHAT!

295
00:16:25,027 --> 00:16:26,236
I SHOULD GO.

296
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,446
WE SHOULDN'T DO THIS.

297
00:16:27,529 --> 00:16:28,906
NOT- NOT TONIGHT.

298
00:16:28,989 --> 00:16:30,324
EXCUSE ME?

299
00:16:31,450 --> 00:16:33,368
YOU'RE UPSET
BECAUSE OF TERRI.

300
00:16:33,452 --> 00:16:37,122
THIS HAS GOT NOTHING TO DO
WITH TERRI.

301
00:16:40,292 --> 00:16:42,586
I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS.

302
00:16:43,462 --> 00:16:44,963
NONE OF THIS
WOULD'VE HAPPENED

303
00:16:45,047 --> 00:16:49,301
IF YOU'D HAVE LET ME LEAVE
RICK BEHIND AT "THE DOT".

304
00:16:52,638 --> 00:16:57,100
I'M NOT THE ONE WHO TOLD HER
TO GO OFF WITH HIM.

305
00:17:02,105 --> 00:17:02,814
(SOBBING)

306
00:17:10,155 --> 00:17:12,241
ELLIE:
I SHOULD DUMP HIM.

307
00:17:12,324 --> 00:17:13,408
MARCO:
SEAN?

308
00:17:13,492 --> 00:17:15,077
ELLIE:
YOU'RE WORTH SIX SEANS.

309
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:16,119
HE CAN'T BE THAT RUDE

310
00:17:16,203 --> 00:17:18,747
AND EXPECT ME
TO STICK AROUND.

311
00:17:18,830 --> 00:17:20,666
SEAN'S RUDE, EL?

312
00:17:21,291 --> 00:17:23,752
WHAT DO YOU CALL BRINGING MARCO
THE-HUMAN-SECURITY-BLANKET

313
00:17:23,836 --> 00:17:25,420

314
00:17:25,504 --> 00:17:27,047
MARCO THE WHAT?

315
00:17:27,130 --> 00:17:28,131
LOOK...

316
00:17:28,215 --> 00:17:31,134
I KNOW YOU WANT EVERYTHING
TO STAY THE SAME.

317
00:17:31,218 --> 00:17:33,470
BUT SEAN COULD BE
GREAT FOR YOU...

318
00:17:33,554 --> 00:17:35,514
IF YOU'D LET HIM.

319
00:18:11,717 --> 00:18:14,011
SPINNER:
WHAT'RE YOU DOING HERE?

320
00:18:14,094 --> 00:18:15,095
TERRI'S IN THE HOSPITAL

321
00:18:15,179 --> 00:18:17,431
AND YOU'RE JUST
SITTING HERE?!

322
00:18:17,514 --> 00:18:19,558
RICK:
SPINNER, STOP! PLEASE!

323
00:18:19,641 --> 00:18:20,309
SPINNER:
OH, DID TERRI TELL YOU TO STOP?

324
00:18:20,392 --> 00:18:21,476
DID YOU LISTEN?

325
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:24,479
PAIGE:
SPINNER! JUST-
JUST LET IT GO!

326
00:18:24,563 --> 00:18:26,273
PLEASE, SPINNER.

327
00:18:26,356 --> 00:18:28,025
STOP IT!
LET HIM GO!

328
00:18:32,404 --> 00:18:34,406
YOU STAY AWAY FROM MY SON!

329
00:18:34,489 --> 00:18:35,490
BOTH OF YOU!

330
00:18:51,882 --> 00:18:53,592
SPINNER, HONEY...

331
00:18:55,886 --> 00:18:58,138
I'M JUST LIKE HIM -
VIOLENT.

332
00:18:58,847 --> 00:19:01,308
PAIGE:
NO. YOU STOPPED YOURSELF.

333
00:19:01,391 --> 00:19:04,061
YOU'RE DIFFERENT, OKAY?
YOU ARE.

334
00:19:13,612 --> 00:19:15,614
RADITCH OVER P.A.:
THE MCGREGOR FAMILY WOULD LIKE

335
00:19:15,697 --> 00:19:18,325
FOR THEIR GET WELL WISHES

336
00:19:18,408 --> 00:19:20,619
IF ANY STUDENTS WOULD LIKE TO
SEND A CARD TO MR. MCGREGOR

337
00:19:20,702 --> 00:19:22,204
DROP THEM OFF IN THE OFFICE

338
00:19:22,287 --> 00:19:23,830

339
00:19:23,914 --> 00:19:24,790

340
00:19:26,291 --> 00:19:27,876
LISTEN... I'M...

341
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:30,003
AREN'T WE THROUGH?

OKAY, ARE YOU, LIKE,

343
00:19:34,258 --> 00:19:35,884
DIDN'T YOU

00:19:35,968 --> 00:19:37,719
LET'S TRY THIS AGAIN.

345
00:19:38,262 --> 00:19:40,097
I'M HERE TO APOLOGIZE.

346
00:19:41,056 --> 00:19:44,560
I HAVEN'T BEEN A VERY GOOD
GIRLFRIEND.

347
00:19:44,643 --> 00:19:48,230
BUT YOU HAVEN'T BEEN THAT
GREAT A BOYFRIEND, EITHER.

348
00:19:48,313 --> 00:19:50,899
LOOK, I DON'T HATE MARCO,
OKAY.

349
00:19:52,401 --> 00:19:55,070
IT'S JUST...
WELL, I'M DATING YOU.

350
00:19:56,405 --> 00:19:58,740
I'VE NEVER DONE
THIS BEFORE.

351
00:19:59,783 --> 00:20:02,452
LIKE, A REAL
RELATIONSHIP THING.

352
00:20:03,078 --> 00:20:06,415
SO IF I DON'T TOTALLY
KNOW HOW IT WORKS...

353
00:20:08,542 --> 00:20:10,210
THEN YOU CAN ASK ME.

354
00:20:30,564 --> 00:20:32,941
PAIGE:
SPIN, LET'S JUST GO,
OKAY?

355
00:20:33,025 --> 00:20:35,527
SPINNER:
NO, LET'S STAY.

356
00:20:36,111 --> 00:20:37,779
WE'LL BE FINE.

357
00:20:41,241 --> 00:20:45,120
MR. MCGREGOR:
UM, WE STILL DON'T KNOW
THE EXTENT OF THE DAMAGE,

358
00:20:45,204 --> 00:20:47,748
BUT SHE CAME THROUGH
THE SURGERY.

359
00:20:47,831 --> 00:20:49,458
THAT'S ONE BIG HURDLE.

360
00:20:49,541 --> 00:20:51,877
PAIGE:
WELL, WE ARE SO GLAD.

361
00:20:53,212 --> 00:20:54,755
AND... WE'RE SO SORRY.

362
00:20:57,090 --> 00:21:00,344
OH, NO. I WAS WAY
OUT OF LINE YESTERDAY.

363
00:21:01,470 --> 00:21:02,638
SPINNER:
YOU WERE UPSET.

364
00:21:02,721 --> 00:21:04,765
MR. MCGREGOR:
AT YOU AND AT MYSELF.

365
00:21:04,848 --> 00:21:06,058
RICK WAS AT OUR PLACE
ALL THE TIME.

366
00:21:06,141 --> 00:21:07,935
I DON'T KNOW WHY
I DIDN'T I SEE.

367
00:21:08,018 --> 00:21:12,314
PAIGE:
BUT WE SAW AND WE SHOULD'VE
SAID SOMETHING.

368
00:21:13,398 --> 00:21:17,402
MR. MCGREGOR:
I'D BETTER GET BACK TO HER
IN CASE SHE COMES AROUND.

369
00:21:17,486 --> 00:21:19,488
THANKS FOR COMING, GUYS.

370
00:21:20,072 --> 00:21:21,823
YOU'RE GOOD FRIENDS.
