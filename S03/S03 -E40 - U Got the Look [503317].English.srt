00:08:51,782 --> 00:08:55,160
IF SOME PEOPLE DON'T LIKE IT,
MAYBE THEY SHOULDN'T LOOK.

181
00:08:55,244 --> 00:08:56,370
DO YOU HAVE SO LITTLE
CONFIDENCE,

182
00:08:56,453 --> 00:08:58,205
YOU HAVE TO SHOW
YOUR ENTIRE BODY?

183
00:08:58,288 --> 00:09:00,999
I DIDN'T ASK FOR
YOUR OPINION LIBERTY.

184
00:09:01,083 --> 00:09:03,043
WHAT I WEAR IS NONE
OF YOUR BUSINESS.

185
00:09:03,126 --> 00:09:04,169
LIBERTY:
FINE.

186
00:09:04,253 --> 00:09:05,838
BUT IT'S AGAINST
THE CODE OF CONDUCT

187
00:09:05,921 --> 00:09:08,048
AND IF SOMEONE WERE TO POINT
IT OUT TO MR. RADITCH

188
00:09:08,131 --> 00:09:11,969
I'M SURE HE'D THINK
IT WAS HIS BUSINESS.

189
00:09:14,805 --> 00:09:16,139
MANNY:
HEY.

190
00:09:16,223 --> 00:09:16,974
HI.

191
00:09:17,891 --> 00:09:19,226
ARE YOU SURE THIS
ISN'T TOO MUCH?

192
00:09:19,309 --> 00:09:20,394
YOU LOOK GREAT!

193
00:09:20,477 --> 00:09:22,396
YOU KNOW I WOULDN'T SAY IT
IF IT WASN'T TRUE.

194
00:09:22,479 --> 00:09:24,231
AND APPARENTLY JT AGREES.

195
00:09:24,314 --> 00:09:25,524
(LAUGHS)

196
00:09:25,607 --> 00:09:27,109
JUST GO TALK TO HER.

197
00:09:27,192 --> 00:09:27,943
UNH UH.

198
00:09:28,026 --> 00:09:29,736
SO WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO
WHEN HE ASKS YOU OUT?

199
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:31,697
LIBERTY:
WHEN WHO ASKS MANNY OUT?

200
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:34,408
JT! ISN'T IT SO CUTE?

201
00:09:34,491 --> 00:09:35,576
OH.

202
00:09:35,659 --> 00:09:38,245
I DIDN'T KNOW YOU LIKED JT.

203
00:09:38,328 --> 00:09:39,496
I MIGHT.

204
00:09:41,331 --> 00:09:42,249
GO!

205
00:09:42,332 --> 00:09:43,834
OKAY, OKAY.

206
00:09:43,917 --> 00:09:46,170
BETTER HURRY UP AND DECIDE.

207
00:09:47,004 --> 00:09:47,921
OKAY, OKAY.

208
00:09:50,716 --> 00:09:51,049
MANNY-

209
00:09:51,133 --> 00:09:54,595
EMMA:
WE GOTTA GO TO A MEETING.
SO, BYE!

210
00:09:54,678 --> 00:09:55,387
HI.

211
00:09:58,557 --> 00:10:00,142
I GUESS, LET ME GUESS,
I JUST UM,

212
00:10:00,225 --> 00:10:04,813
INTERRUPTED A BIG TALK ABOUT
ENDANGERED PLATYPUSES.

213
00:10:04,897 --> 00:10:07,858
(LAUGHS) UM, SOMETHING A BIT
MORE SERIOUS.

214
00:10:07,941 --> 00:10:08,692
JT:
WELL I MEAN UH...

215
00:10:08,775 --> 00:10:12,154
WHAT'S MORE SERIOUS THAN
A MAMMAL THAT CAN LAY EGGS?

216
00:10:12,237 --> 00:10:14,406
I DON'T KNOW, YOU TELL ME.

217
00:10:20,037 --> 00:10:21,079
SULLY:
HEY.

218
00:10:21,163 --> 00:10:22,748
MANNY, RIGHT?

219
00:10:24,166 --> 00:10:26,084
THIS THING,
ARE YOU GONNA BE THERE?

220
00:10:26,168 --> 00:10:30,464
YEAH. YEAH, WELL MY BEST
FRIEND IS ORGANIZING IT SO...

221
00:10:30,547 --> 00:10:31,882
SULLY:
GREAT. WELL UH...

222
00:10:31,965 --> 00:10:34,051
MAYBE I'LL SHOW UP.

223
00:10:36,136 --> 00:10:37,471
JT:
MANNY?

224
00:10:38,096 --> 00:10:39,097
MANNY?

225
00:10:39,723 --> 00:10:40,557
OH, SORRY.

226
00:10:41,183 --> 00:10:43,185
WHA-WHAT WERE
WE TALKING ABOUT?

227
00:10:43,268 --> 00:10:45,938
PLATYPUSES,
WHAT'S MORE SERIOUS.

228
00:10:47,397 --> 00:10:48,774
MANNY? HELLO?

229
00:10:52,486 --> 00:10:54,071
(KNOCKING ON WINDOW)

230
00:10:55,531 --> 00:10:57,324
EMMA:
WHAT I'M SAYING IS...

231
00:10:57,407 --> 00:11:00,244
IF YOUR PARENTS WANT TO BUY A
TROPICAL HARDWOOD TOILET SEAT,

232
00:11:00,327 --> 00:11:01,912
DON'T LET THEM.

233
00:11:01,995 --> 00:11:03,497
EVERY YEAR MILLIONS OF HECTARES

234
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:06,083
OF TROPICAL RAIN FORESTS
ARE DESTROYED.

235
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:08,669
AND RAIN FORESTS ARE IMPORTANT
FOR SO MANY REASONS.

236
00:11:08,752 --> 00:11:11,213
THEY'RE HOME TO MANY SPECIES
OF ANIMALS AND PLANTS.

237
00:11:11,296 --> 00:11:13,632
THEY PROVIDE OXYGEN
AND FRESH DRINKING WATER.

238
00:11:13,715 --> 00:11:14,508
(LAUGHTER)

239
00:11:14,591 --> 00:11:16,927
OH YOU'RE SO SWEET.

240
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:18,011
MANNY.

241
00:11:18,929 --> 00:11:20,013
WHAT'S THAT SHORT FOR?

242
00:11:20,097 --> 00:11:23,725
MANNY:
MANNY? UH... MANUELLA,
ACTUALLY.

243
00:11:24,393 --> 00:11:25,644
MANUELLA.

244
00:11:26,812 --> 00:11:27,604
NICE.

245
00:11:27,688 --> 00:11:28,522
(LAUGHS)

246
00:11:28,605 --> 00:11:30,148
EMMA:
SO IF YOUR PARENTS
STILL INSIST

247
00:11:30,232 --> 00:11:31,733
ON BUYING TROPICAL HARDWOOD,

248
00:11:31,817 --> 00:11:33,694
TELL THEM THAT BY BUYING
THE TOILET SEAT,

249
00:11:33,777 --> 00:11:36,029
THEY'RE DESTROYING
THE RAINFOREST...

250
00:11:36,113 --> 00:11:38,115
OUR PLANET'S LUNGS.

251
00:11:43,787 --> 00:11:44,746
JOEY:
CAITLIN!

252
00:11:44,830 --> 00:11:47,040
JOEY! HEY, WHAT ARE
YOU DOING HERE?

253
00:11:47,124 --> 00:11:48,208
UH ACTUALLY,
I WAS WONDERING

254
00:11:48,292 --> 00:11:49,585
IF COULD BORROW
THAT VIDEO CAMERA

255
00:11:49,668 --> 00:11:51,211
THAT YOU HAD
AT SPIKE'S SHOWER.

256
00:11:51,295 --> 00:11:54,381
OH YEAH, SURE. UH...
WHAT IS IT FOR ANGELA?

257
00:11:54,464 --> 00:11:57,426
ACTUALLY IT'S FOR
CRAIG'S BAND.

258
00:11:57,509 --> 00:11:57,926
BAND?

259
00:11:58,510 --> 00:11:59,178
YEAH.

260
00:11:59,261 --> 00:12:02,055
OH, YOU MUST BE HAVING
SOME SERIOUS FLASHBACKS.

261
00:12:02,139 --> 00:12:02,973
OH, AM I EVER.

262
00:12:03,056 --> 00:12:04,892
WE WERE JAMMING
IN THE GARAGE LAST NIGHT,

263
00:12:04,975 --> 00:12:06,393
IT WAS LIKE TOTALLY
LIKE THE ZITS AGAIN.

264
00:12:06,476 --> 00:12:07,603
ALL OVER.

265
00:12:07,686 --> 00:12:09,229
CATILIN:
UH... JAMMIN'?

266
00:12:09,313 --> 00:12:09,938
JOEY:
YEAH.

267
00:12:10,022 --> 00:12:12,900
CAITLIN:
(LAUGHS)
JOEY, YOU'RE NOT A TEENAGER.

268
00:12:12,983 --> 00:12:14,484
I KNOW, I JUST THOUGHT
THAT THE BOYS

269
00:12:14,568 --> 00:12:16,320
COULD USE SOME DIRECTION.

270
00:12:16,403 --> 00:12:18,155
I KNOW YOU THOUGHT THAT
THE ZITS WERE A JOKE.

271
00:12:18,238 --> 00:12:19,740
I DID NOT!

272
00:12:19,823 --> 00:12:21,450
BUT IF WE HAD SOME
GUIDANCE BACK THEN,

273
00:12:21,533 --> 00:12:23,744
MAYBE THINGS WOULD
HAVE BEEN DIFFERENT.

274
00:12:23,827 --> 00:12:27,414
AND MAYBE IF YOU'D WRITTEN
MORE THAN ONE SONG.

275
00:12:27,497 --> 00:12:29,249
(LAUGHS) THERE YOU GO.

276
00:12:29,333 --> 00:12:30,709
CAMERA.

277
00:12:30,792 --> 00:12:31,960
JUST UH...

278
00:12:32,669 --> 00:12:34,421
UH, NEVER MIND.

279
00:12:35,005 --> 00:12:36,089
WHAT?

280
00:12:36,173 --> 00:12:38,926
JUST REMEMBER THAT
THEY'RE TEENAGERS.

281
00:12:39,009 --> 00:12:40,427
THAT'S ALL I'M GONNA SAY.

282
00:12:40,511 --> 00:12:40,844
BYE.

283
00:12:44,056 --> 00:12:45,682
(ROCK BAND PLAYING)

284
00:12:57,945 --> 00:13:00,781
OKAY, OKAY, GUYS STOP!
STOP! STOP.

285
00:13:00,864 --> 00:13:03,242
CRAIG, I'M ONLY GETTIN'
YOUR PROFILE, MAN.

286
00:13:03,325 --> 00:13:04,451
JOEY THIS IS JUST A REHEARSAL.

287
00:13:04,535 --> 00:13:07,079
I REALLY THINK WE SHOULD
HOLD OFF WITH THE CAMERA AND...

288
00:13:07,162 --> 00:13:10,874
WE TALKED ABOUT THIS GUYS.
THIS CAMERA IS YOUR AUDIENCE.

289
00:13:10,958 --> 00:13:12,543
ALL RIGHT? AND STAGE PRESENCE
IS JUST AS IMPORTANT

290
00:13:12,626 --> 00:13:14,628
AS YOUR SOUND.

291
00:13:14,711 --> 00:13:16,338
AND... SPEAKING OF SOUND,

292
00:13:16,421 --> 00:13:18,173
UH, I KNOW YOU GUYS WANT
TO PLAY YOUR OWN MUSIC,

293
00:13:18,257 --> 00:13:20,300
AND I THINK THAT'S
A GREAT GOAL, OKAY?

294
00:13:20,384 --> 00:13:22,553
BUT MAYBE WE SHOULD START
WITH SOME COVERS FIRST.

295
00:13:22,636 --> 00:13:23,554
LIKE UH...

296
00:13:23,637 --> 00:13:24,721
MAYBE SOME GEORGE MICHAEL?

WHAT? (TELEPHONE RINGS)

300
00:13:28,767 --> 00:13:29,977
JUST THINK ABOUT IT, OKAY?

301
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:32,938
I MEAN, YOU GUYS HAVE TO LEARN
TO WALK BEFORE YOU CAN RUN.

302
00:13:33,021 --> 00:13:34,273
OKAY?

303
00:13:34,356 --> 00:13:34,857
HELLO?

304
00:13:35,566 --> 00:13:38,819
HOLD ON, I CAN'T HEAR YOU.
HOLD ON. YEAH...

305
00:13:38,902 --> 00:13:40,362

TO TALK TO HIM.

TO TELL HIM?

HE'S SO DELUDED,
HE THINKS HE'S IN THE BAND.

BY ALIENS?

MR. EHL IN THE SHOP.

OF THE POSTERS IN THE HALLWAY.

334
00:14:42,508 --> 00:14:43,592

SOMETHING?

MANNY, I'VE BEEN MEANING
TO TALK TO YOU

345
00:15:13,247 --> 00:15:14,414
ABOUT YOUR ATTIRE.

346
00:15:14,498 --> 00:15:16,041
IT CONTRAVENES THE CODE
OF CONDUCT.

347

BUT EVERYBODY WEARS
CROP TOPS.

348

IT'S NOT ABOUT THE CROP TOP.

I EXPECT YOU TO SHOW UP
TOMORROW

350
00:15:21,004 --> 00:15:23,340
IN AN OUTFIT THAT DOES NOT
REVEAL YOUR UNDERGARMENTS.

351

BUT LOW-RIDERS ARE IN,
AND I-

352
00:15:25,509 --> 00:15:28,303

SO NO MORE VISIBLE UNDERWEAR.

I KNOW YOU WERE REALLY UPSET
THAT RADITCH BUSTED YOU.

DO YOU WANT

THEY LIVE BOTH ON LAND

390
00:17:12,366 --> 00:17:14,493
AND THEY FIND FOOD
IN BOTH REALMS:

391
00:17:14,576 --> 00:17:18,455
INSECTS, SMALL FISH,
AND EVEN OTHER FROGS.

392
00:17:18,539 --> 00:17:20,165

399
00:17:53,198 --> 00:17:54,867
BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T VOLUNTEER.

400
00:17:54,950 --> 00:17:57,870
WELL, I UH,

401
00:17:58,370 --> 00:18:01,540

HOW COULD YOU DO THAT TO JT?

419
00:18:55,052 --> 00:18:56,887
WHAT?
I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.

420
00:18:56,970 --> 00:18:58,805
UH NO, YOU JUST
BROKE HIS HEART.

421
00:18:58,889 --> 00:18:59,890
EMMA, C'MON.

422
00:19:00,974 --> 00:19:02,601
YOU'RE GETTING
THIS HUGE EGO.

423
00:19:02,684 --> 00:19:03,936
I AM NOT.

424
00:19:04,019 --> 00:19:04,937
JUST BECAUSE
I'M DRESSING LIKE-

425
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:07,022
YOU'RE DRESSING
LIKE AN IDIOT.

426
00:19:07,105 --> 00:19:09,983
BUT WHAT I REALLY CARE ABOUT
IS HOW YOU'RE ACTING.

427
00:19:10,067 --> 00:19:12,653
I'M ALWAYS THERE
FOR YOU, EMMA.

428
00:19:12,736 --> 00:19:14,738
WHEN YOU FIGHT WITH SEAN,

429
00:19:14,821 --> 00:19:17,157
WHEN YOU FIND OUT YOUR
MOM'S PREGNANT,

430
00:19:17,241 --> 00:19:20,702
FOR YOUR STUPID
ENVIRONMENTAL CLUB.

431
00:19:20,786 --> 00:19:22,621
IT'S NOT STUPID.

432
00:19:23,205 --> 00:19:25,123
BUT THE ONE TIME
IT'S NOT ABOUT YOU,

433
00:19:25,207 --> 00:19:27,209
YOU DO THIS TO ME.

434
00:19:29,169 --> 00:19:30,087
I'M JUST CONCERNED-

435
00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:34,174
'CAUSE IT SOUNDS MORE
LIKE YOU'RE JEALOUS.

436

AND IF YOU CAN'T
ACCEPT THAT,

441
00:19:45,102 --> 00:19:46,937

00:19:57,781 --> 00:20:00,200

JOEY:

450
00:20:21,138 --> 00:20:22,764

IN HIGH SCHOOL,

451
00:20:22,848 --> 00:20:26,685
MY BAND, THE ZITS,
MEANT EVERYTHING TO ME.

452
00:20:26,768 --> 00:20:30,689
I MEAN, THEY WERE GOOD TIMES--
SOME OF THE BEST.

453
00:20:31,356 --> 00:20:33,317
ANYTHING FELT POSSIBLE.

454
00:20:34,693 --> 00:20:36,111
AND THEN ONE DAY I WAKE UP,
I'M IN MY THIRTIES,

455
00:20:36,195 --> 00:20:38,030
AND I HAVE A DAUGHTER
AND A TEENAGE STEP-SON

456
00:20:38,113 --> 00:20:42,993

457
00:20:43,076 --> 00:20:47,748

458
00:20:48,832 --> 00:20:51,585
SO MARCO'S BASEMENT, HUH?
