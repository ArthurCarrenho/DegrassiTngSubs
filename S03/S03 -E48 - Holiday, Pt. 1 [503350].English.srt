00:00:02,252 --> 00:00:05,589
JOEY:
OKAY, HANG ON WHILE
I GET IT DOWN.

3
00:00:10,052 --> 00:00:11,094
IT'S PERFECT.

4
00:00:11,845 --> 00:00:13,680
SYDNEY:
ALMOST. CRAIG?

5
00:00:14,765 --> 00:00:17,017
COULD YOU TWIST IT
ABOUT 30 DEGREES CLOCKWISE?

6
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:19,520
THIS SIDE'S FULLER
THAN THE FRONT.

7
00:00:19,603 --> 00:00:23,690
JOE, THE LIGHTS ON THE TOP,
MAYBE A BIT TOO MUCH?

8
00:00:24,483 --> 00:00:25,609
OKAY, OKAY,
COME ON. LET'S GO.

00:00:25,692 --> 00:00:28,695
LET'S TURN IT AROUND.

SYDNEY:

16
00:00:43,377 --> 00:00:47,214
JOEY:
(SIGH) SYDNEY HAS AN UNCANNY
EYE FOR EVERYTHING.

17
00:00:47,297 --> 00:00:48,549
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
WE'D DO WITHOUT HER.

18
00:00:48,632 --> 00:00:49,716
SIMPSON:

00:01:03,647 --> 00:01:04,982
HEY, IT'S MANNY.

25
00:01:06,108 --> 00:01:07,693
IS THIS A BAD TIME?

26
00:01:08,902 --> 00:01:09,570
SORT OF.

27
00:01:10,362 --> 00:01:11,989
RIGHT. SHE'S THERE.

00:01:13,282 --> 00:01:16,201

DON'T YOU JUST LOVE

46
00:02:21,099 --> 00:02:21,725
OH SURE, YEAH.

47
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:25,270
ANOTHER EXCUSE FOR US
TO OVER-SPEND AND OVER-EAT.

48
00:02:25,354 --> 00:02:26,980
OKAY, SCROOGE.
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?

49
00:02:27,064 --> 00:02:28,065
ARE YOU GONNA VISIT
YOUR MOM?

50
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:30,609
NOPE. SHE'S GONE ON A CRUISE
WITH HER NEW BOYFRIEND.

51
00:02:30,692 --> 00:02:33,654
SO I AM SPENDING THE HOLIDAYS
PAMPERING MYSELF

52
00:02:33,737 --> 00:02:36,573

00:02:36,657 --> 00:02:39,326
OH, CAITLIN, YOU CAN'T
SPEND CHRISTMAS ALONE.

00:02:44,081 --> 00:02:45,749

I WANT TO GO TO A SPA.

56
00:02:45,832 --> 00:02:47,084
I'VE WORKED VERY HARD.

57
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:50,379
THIS IS MY CHRISTMAS GIFT

58
00:02:50,462 --> 00:02:51,338
OKAY.

77
00:03:37,301 --> 00:03:38,719
I'VE GOT A WORK COMMITMENT.

00:03:45,809 --> 00:03:49,980
ANGIE UNDERSTANDS.
NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT.

82
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:53,817
AND WHO SAYS MONEY
CAN'T BUY HAPPINESS?

83
00:03:57,779 --> 00:03:58,906
JOEY:
COME ON, SWEETIE.

84
00:03:58,989 --> 00:04:00,407

ALL THE BANK MACHINES

99
00:04:50,332 --> 00:04:53,836
THERE WERE PLOWS
BACKING UP TRAFFIC.

100
00:04:55,879 --> 00:04:59,049
CAITLIN, SIT HERE.
BATHROOM BREAK.

101
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:00,050

103
00:05:05,472 --> 00:05:07,224
JOEY:
SHE'S THE ONE IN THE MIDDLE.

104
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:07,891
(LAUGH)

105
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:12,396
CAITLIN:

106
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:13,397
BUT SERIOUSLY,

00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,732
THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR INVITING ME TONIGHT.

108
00:05:15,816 --> 00:05:18,110
IT'S JUST WHAT I NEEDED.

109
00:05:18,193 --> 00:05:19,862
NO PROBLEM, SCROOGE.

00:05:21,864 --> 00:05:23,782
OH LOOK, THERE'S SHE IS!

00:05:26,535 --> 00:05:28,912
JOEY:
OH, LOOK AT THAT!

113
00:05:30,414 --> 00:05:33,292
I CAN'T YOU BELIEVE SYDNEY'S
MISSING ALL OF THIS?

114
00:05:33,375 --> 00:05:34,626
HER LOSS.

115
00:05:37,713 --> 00:05:40,299
MANNY:
YOU GUYS WERE SO AMAZING
OUT THERE.

116
00:05:40,382 --> 00:05:42,342
WHY DON'T WE TAKE THIS BACK

117
00:05:42,426 --> 00:05:43,260

SPINNER:

125
00:06:11,246 --> 00:06:14,625
MANNY:
UM, I SHOULD GET BACK

126
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:21,715
SPINNER, ARE YOU
STALKING ME OR WHAT?

127
00:06:21,798 --> 00:06:25,844
SPINNER:
NO MAN, MY SISTER'S ON

128
00:06:25,928 --> 00:06:28,931
WAIT, WHY AM I DOING

00:06:44,905 --> 00:06:48,242
YOU HAVE ASHLEY - GORGEOUS,
SMART, LIKE A FINE CHAMPAGNE,

00:06:48,325 --> 00:06:52,329
AND THEN YOU HAVE MANNY -

138
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:56,041
LIKE ICE CREAM,
BUT HOT. VERY HOT.

139
00:06:56,124 --> 00:06:58,293
SO, YOU DON'T THINK
IT'S WRONG?

140
00:06:58,377 --> 00:07:01,421
FOR ME, YEAH.
BUT FOR YOU? NO.

141
00:07:01,505 --> 00:07:02,714
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

142
00:07:02,798 --> 00:07:05,259
WELL, I HAVE PAIGE.
I KNOW SHE'S THE ONE.

143
00:07:05,342 --> 00:07:06,760
BUT YOU?
YOU'RE NOT SURE YET.

144
00:07:06,844 --> 00:07:08,762
YOU'RE STILL
SAMPLING BOTH.

145
00:07:08,846 --> 00:07:11,014
IT'S A TRY BEFORE YOU BUY
KINDA DEAL.

146
00:07:11,098 --> 00:07:14,351
NOT TO MENTION
YOU'RE A BIG STUD.

147
00:07:15,352 --> 00:07:16,937
YEAH, WELL...

148
00:07:18,522 --> 00:07:20,107
I GET AROUND.

149
00:07:22,067 --> 00:07:23,986
WASN'T SYDNEY SUPPOSED
TO BE HOME BY NOW?

150
00:07:24,069 --> 00:07:26,321
UH, YEAH, SHE WAS.

HMM. AT LEAST SHE'S A CAREER
WOMAN THAT HAS A LIFE.

153
00:07:32,035 --> 00:07:33,745
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING
ABOUT?

154
00:07:33,829 --> 00:07:35,080
YOU'RE THE HOST OF ONE
OF THE MOST POPULAR PROGRAMS

155
00:07:35,163 --> 00:07:36,123
IN THE COUNTRY.

156
00:07:36,206 --> 00:07:39,209
YEAH, WELL,
IT'S A COOL DAY JOB.

157
00:07:39,293 --> 00:07:42,087
IT DOESN'T REALLY KEEP ME
WARM AT NIGHT THOUGH, DOES IT?

158
00:07:46,258 --> 00:07:47,801
OW, OW, MAN!

159
00:07:47,885 --> 00:07:49,803
OH, ARE YOU OKAY?

160
00:07:49,887 --> 00:07:50,971
OW. OW.

161
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:53,599

OH.

165
00:08:01,064 --> 00:08:03,150
SYD, QUICK -
WHAT DO YOU DO FOR A BURN?

166
00:08:03,233 --> 00:08:04,860
UH, PUT IT UNDER COLD WATER.

167
00:08:04,943 --> 00:08:06,653
ACTUALLY,
HOT WATER WORKS BETTER.

168
00:08:06,737 --> 00:08:08,113
IT'S HOMEOPATHIC.

169
00:08:09,698 --> 00:08:10,199
RIGHT.

170
00:08:10,699 --> 00:08:13,827
UM, WELL, I'LL LEAVE
YOU GUYS TO THAT.

171
00:08:13,911 --> 00:08:16,413

00:08:22,377 --> 00:08:23,378
SYDNEY:
THANKS.

174
00:08:23,462 --> 00:08:25,088
NICE TO SEE YOU... AGAIN.

175
00:08:25,172 --> 00:08:25,506
BYE.

176
00:08:33,764 --> 00:08:36,600
HEY! YOU'RE LATE
AND I'M FREEZING.

177
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:40,187
SO YOU NEED TO
WARM ME UP.

178
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:42,940
CRAIG:
(CHUCKLES) I CAN DO THAT.

179
00:08:51,281 --> 00:08:53,408
OKAY, I KNOW IT'S EARLY

180
00:08:53,492 --> 00:08:54,493
BUT...

181
00:08:55,869 --> 00:08:59,540
IF YOU'RE PRACTICING OUT HERE,
YOU'RE GONNA NEED IT.

182
00:08:59,623 --> 00:09:01,208
I KNIT IT MYSELF.

183
00:09:01,291 --> 00:09:02,459
(LAUGHS)

184
00:09:04,294 --> 00:09:06,547
I KNOW.
I KNOW, IT'S DORKY.

185
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:08,882
NAH, NAH, IT'S SWEET.

186
00:09:09,842 --> 00:09:11,510
JUST LIKE YOU.

187
00:09:12,803 --> 00:09:15,180
GOOD, BECAUSE ALL I WANT
FOR CHRISTMAS FROM YOU

188
00:09:15,264 --> 00:09:16,139
IS ONE THING.

189
00:09:16,223 --> 00:09:17,683
ALL RIGHT,
LET ME GUESS.

190
00:09:17,766 --> 00:09:19,476
UM... DIAMONDS?

191
00:09:20,519 --> 00:09:21,687
NEW CAR?

192
00:09:22,688 --> 00:09:24,439
WHAT? A CHIHUAHUA?

193
00:09:24,523 --> 00:09:25,566
NO.

194
00:09:25,649 --> 00:09:27,109
WHAT DO YOU WANT?
WHAT?

195
00:09:27,192 --> 00:09:29,862
I WANT YOU
TO DUMP ASHLEY.

196
00:09:35,033 --> 00:09:36,451
IT'S TIME, YOU KNOW?

197
00:09:36,535 --> 00:09:38,203
AND I'VE BEEN PATIENT.

198
00:09:38,287 --> 00:09:39,872
BUT I CAN'T-

199
00:09:39,955 --> 00:09:42,875
UM, I CAN'T MAKE
THAT CHOICE.

200
00:09:46,962 --> 00:09:49,214
I THINK YOU JUST DID.

201
00:10:05,731 --> 00:10:07,774
P.A. ANNOUNCER:

202
00:10:07,858 --> 00:10:10,360

203
00:10:10,444 --> 00:10:15,282

00:10:41,767 --> 00:10:42,267

211
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:50,025
THIS CRAPPY GUITAR!

212
00:10:52,486 --> 00:10:54,738
YEAH AND THAT'S GONNA
MAKE IT BETTER.

213
00:10:54,821 --> 00:10:56,823
WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU
TODAY?

214
00:10:56,907 --> 00:10:58,075
NOTHING.

215
00:10:59,284 --> 00:11:00,536
I'M FINE.

216
00:11:10,504 --> 00:11:11,421
CAITLIN:

MESSY?

223
00:11:21,849 --> 00:11:25,018
EXCITING. YOU KNOW,
TV, THE BIZ.

224
00:11:25,811 --> 00:11:27,563
CAITLIN?
CONTACT SHEETS ARE IN.

225
00:11:27,646 --> 00:11:28,522
WANNA LOOK AT THEM?

226
00:11:28,605 --> 00:11:29,606
OH YEAH, DEFINITELY.

00:11:29,690 --> 00:11:34,111
UM, I'LL MEET YOU IN YOUR
OFFICE IN, SAY, FIVE?

228
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:38,407
THE BOYS AREN'T THAT CUTE

229
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:39,199
SO?

230
00:11:41,827 --> 00:11:44,079
SO, HE'S MY BOSS,
HE'S GAY,

231
00:11:44,955 --> 00:11:47,416
AND I DON'T DATE GUYS

232
00:11:47,499 --> 00:11:49,960
NOT SINCE MY EX-FIANCEE,
THE DIRECTOR.

233
00:11:50,043 --> 00:11:51,295
EMPHASIS ON EX.

234
00:11:53,046 --> 00:11:55,382
SO, UH, WHO DO YOU DATE
THEN?

235
00:11:56,717 --> 00:11:59,386
STRICTLY REAL WORLD

236
00:12:02,931 --> 00:12:05,350
SO, BIG FAVOUR TIME,

237
00:12:05,434 --> 00:12:07,769
JOE AND I, WE HAVE MY WORK
PARTY TONIGHT

238
00:12:07,853 --> 00:12:11,315
AND CRAIG'S BUSY
AND OUR BABYSITTER BAILED.

239
00:12:11,398 --> 00:12:12,649
WHAT TIME DO YOU
WANT ME THERE?

240
00:12:12,733 --> 00:12:14,067
UH, YOU'RE SURE?

241
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:16,486
ANYTIME BEFORE SIX.

242
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:18,071
YOU'RE A GOD-SEND.

243
00:12:18,697 --> 00:12:19,364
NO PROB.

244
00:12:20,157 --> 00:12:21,491
THANKS FOR THE PLANT.

245
00:12:21,575 --> 00:12:23,577
OH, AND IF YOU COULD PICK UP
A DVD FOR ANGE,

246
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:25,162
THAT WOULD BE FAB.

247
00:12:31,043 --> 00:12:33,003
(READING) WHAT'S TODAY?
CRIED SCROOGE,

248
00:12:33,086 --> 00:12:35,839
CALLING DOWNWARD TO A BOY
IN SUNDAY CLOTHES,

249
00:12:35,923 --> 00:12:38,842
WHO PERHAPS HAD LOITERED
IN TO LOOK ABOUT HIM.

250
00:12:38,926 --> 00:12:42,846
AIH? RETURNED THE BOY,
WITH ALL HIS MIGHT OF WONDER.

251
00:12:42,930 --> 00:12:43,889
WHAT'S TODAY MY FINE FELLOW?
SAID SCROUGE.

252
00:12:43,972 --> 00:12:46,475
CRAIG:
CAN I USE THE WASHROOM?

253
00:12:47,059 --> 00:12:51,772
JIMMY:
TODAY, REPLIED THE BOY...
WHY CHRISTMAS DAY.

254
00:12:54,024 --> 00:12:55,025
MANNY.

255
00:12:55,901 --> 00:12:57,528
MANNY, STOP!

256
00:12:57,611 --> 00:12:58,779
COME ON!

257
00:13:00,781 --> 00:13:01,782
IT'S JUST...

258
00:13:02,991 --> 00:13:04,493
I LOVE YOU, CRAIG.

259
00:13:06,411 --> 00:13:09,414
AND I THOUGHT YOU FELT
THE SAME WAY.

260
00:13:10,123 --> 00:13:11,792
BUT I DO.
I DO, IT'S JUST-

261
00:13:11,875 --> 00:13:13,627
ASHLEY, I KNOW.

262
00:13:14,753 --> 00:13:17,130
AND SHE MIGHT LOVE YOU,

263
00:13:17,714 --> 00:13:20,217
BUT NOT AS MUCH AS I DO.

264
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:24,054
(SIGHS)

265
00:13:27,057 --> 00:13:27,558
(BANG)

266
00:13:46,326 --> 00:13:47,995
ANGELA:
THIS IS A PIPE FOR DADDY.

267
00:13:48,078 --> 00:13:49,413
CAITLIN:
OH, COOL.

268
00:13:49,496 --> 00:13:53,375
SO DADDY GETS A PIPE,
CRAIG GETS A NEW GUITAR.

269
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:55,627
AND NOW SOMETHING
FOR SYDNEY.

270
00:13:55,711 --> 00:13:57,671
OH RIGHT,
SYDNEY.

271
00:13:58,380 --> 00:13:59,506
SHE MADE ME A DRESS.

272
00:13:59,590 --> 00:14:01,508
CAN I GO WEAR IT?
PLEASE?

273
00:14:01,592 --> 00:14:04,094
OKAY, BUT BE REALLY
CAREFUL, OKAY?

274
00:14:04,178 --> 00:14:07,764
WASH YOUR HANDS BEFORE
YOU PUT IT ON.

275
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:10,601
OH, HI.

276
00:14:10,684 --> 00:14:12,394
BABYSITTER EMERGENCY.

277
00:14:12,895 --> 00:14:15,063
I THOUGHT YOU WERE SPENDING
THE EVENING OVER AT ASHLEY'S?

278
00:14:15,147 --> 00:14:16,982
YEAH, UH, I AM, LATER.

279
00:14:21,612 --> 00:14:23,488
AND MAYBE YOU CAN HELP ME.

280
00:14:23,572 --> 00:14:24,865
SURE, I'LL TRY.

281
00:14:25,449 --> 00:14:26,366
OKAY, UH...

282
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:31,747
IF YOU'RE WITH SOMEONE
REALLY GREAT, LIKE ASH,

283
00:14:32,372 --> 00:14:33,874
THAT SHOULD BE EVERYTHING,
RIGHT?

284
00:14:33,957 --> 00:14:36,376
SO I SHOULD FEEL LUCKY.

285
00:14:36,919 --> 00:14:39,671
OKAY, BELIEVE ME,
I'M NO EXPERT.

286
00:14:39,755 --> 00:14:41,924
BUT LOVE ISN'T ABOUT LUCK.

287
00:14:43,509 --> 00:14:46,762
IT'S ABOUT BEING WITH
THE RIGHT PERSON.

288
00:14:52,684 --> 00:14:54,269
HOPE I HELPED.

289
00:14:59,024 --> 00:15:01,276
(MUSIC FROM THE NUTCRACKER)

290
00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:30,430
MANNY!

291
00:15:40,023 --> 00:15:41,859
I MADE A HUGE MISTAKE!

292
00:15:41,942 --> 00:15:44,278
YOU'RE THE ONE FOR ME.

293
00:15:44,903 --> 00:15:46,071
OKAY, LOOK.

294
00:15:46,154 --> 00:15:48,323
NOT ASHLEY AND I'M GONNA
TELL HER THAT.

295
00:15:48,407 --> 00:15:50,242
OKAY? IT'S YOU.

296
00:15:50,325 --> 00:15:52,619
IT'S ALWAYS BEEN YOU.

297
00:16:17,603 --> 00:16:18,729
JOEY:
I TOLD YOU I WASN'T
GOING TO FIT IN.

298
00:16:18,812 --> 00:16:20,564
SYDNEY:
JOE, YOU DID GREAT.

299
00:16:20,647 --> 00:16:21,648
JOEY:
YEAH, RIGHT.

300
00:16:21,732 --> 00:16:22,774
I TALKED TO THE BARTENDER
ALL NIGHT.

301
00:16:22,858 --> 00:16:24,651
HE KNOWS MY WHOLE LIFE STORY.

302
00:16:24,735 --> 00:16:25,736
YOUR FRIENDS,
THEY THINK I'M A-

303
00:16:25,819 --> 00:16:28,197
SYDNEY:
MY FRIENDS LOVED YOU.

304
00:16:29,072 --> 00:16:29,990
THE MORE YOU GO
TO THESE WORK THINGS,

305
00:16:30,073 --> 00:16:31,742
THE MORE COMFORTABLE
YOU'LL BE

306
00:16:31,825 --> 00:16:34,745
AND THE BETTER OFF
YOU'LL BE AT THEM.

307
00:16:34,828 --> 00:16:35,996
(CAMERA CLICK)

308
00:16:37,206 --> 00:16:38,749
JOEY:
I GOT YOU.

309
00:16:38,832 --> 00:16:39,833
DADDY!

310
00:16:40,626 --> 00:16:42,002
SLEEPING ON THE JOB?

311
00:16:42,085 --> 00:16:44,338
WE HAD SO MUCH FUN,
AND WE-

312
00:16:45,797 --> 00:16:47,799
ANGELA, WHY ARE YOU
WEARING THAT?

313
00:16:47,883 --> 00:16:50,594
'CAUSE IT'S MY DRESS.
YOU MADE IT.

314
00:16:50,677 --> 00:16:52,304
I KNOW I MADE IT -
FOR YOUR PAGEANT,

315
00:16:52,387 --> 00:16:55,224
NOT SO YOU CAN WATCH TV
AND SPILL STUFF ON IT.

316
00:16:55,307 --> 00:16:57,059
OH SYDNEY,
DON'T BE MAD AT HER-

317
00:16:57,142 --> 00:16:59,186
I'M NOT MAD AT HER.

318
00:17:15,202 --> 00:17:18,789
JOEY:
CAITLIN, AGAIN,
I AM SO SORRY ABOUT THAT.

319
00:17:18,872 --> 00:17:20,541
HEY, I SCREWED UP
AS USUAL.

320
00:17:20,624 --> 00:17:22,292
YOU KNOW? I'M SUPPOSED
TO GO LEFT, I GO RIGHT.

321
00:17:22,376 --> 00:17:23,043
I'M IMPULSIVE.

322
00:17:23,126 --> 00:17:24,294
YOU'RE INSANE.

323
00:17:24,378 --> 00:17:25,712
WE'LL TAKE THE DRESS
TO THE DRY CLEANERS

324
00:17:25,796 --> 00:17:27,589
AND EVERYTHING WILL
BE FINE.

325
00:17:27,673 --> 00:17:29,007
SYDNEY HATES ME.

326
00:17:29,508 --> 00:17:30,425
JOEY:
SHE DOESN'T HATE YOU,

327
00:17:30,509 --> 00:17:33,554
SHE JUST LIKES THINGS
TO BE... JUST SO.

328
00:17:34,555 --> 00:17:37,391
I'M SUCH A DRAMA QUEEN.
I'M SORRY.

329
00:17:37,474 --> 00:17:38,934
IT'S NOTHING TO BE
SORRY FOR.

330
00:17:39,017 --> 00:17:41,061
IT'S THE HOLIDAYS.

331
00:17:41,144 --> 00:17:43,647
IT CAN BE TOUGH.
I KNOW.

332
00:18:09,548 --> 00:18:12,426
HEY CRAIG.
HAPPY HANUKKAH.

333
00:18:12,509 --> 00:18:14,178
TAKE YOUR BOOTS OFF.

334
00:18:16,263 --> 00:18:18,599
ASHLEY:
HEY, YOU'RE FINALLY HERE.

335
00:18:18,682 --> 00:18:19,600
YEAH.

336
00:18:20,934 --> 00:18:22,686
ASHLEY:
IS EVERYTHING OKAY?

337
00:18:22,769 --> 00:18:27,149
UM, ACTUALLY I WANTED
TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT SOMETHING.

338
00:18:27,691 --> 00:18:29,026
OKAY, BUT FIRST?

339
00:18:31,612 --> 00:18:35,282
I KNOW IT LOOKS A BIT
BEATEN UP BUT OPEN IT.

340
00:18:38,368 --> 00:18:39,536
COME ON.

341
00:18:49,963 --> 00:18:51,590
IT WAS MY GRANDFATHER'S.

342
00:18:51,673 --> 00:18:55,010
HE PLAYED IT BACK IN THE 40's
WITH DJANGO REINHART.

343
00:18:55,093 --> 00:18:56,011
HE LEFT IT TO ME,

344
00:18:56,094 --> 00:18:58,597
AND NOW I WANT YOU TO HAVE IT.

345
00:19:02,476 --> 00:19:04,561
THIS IS INCREDIBLE.

346
00:19:04,645 --> 00:19:06,772
WELL, IT'S BECAUSE
YOU'RE INCREDIBLE.

347
00:19:06,855 --> 00:19:08,065
