00:00:21,855 --> 00:00:23,190
I DON'T FEEL SO GOOD.

00:00:23,273 --> 00:00:25,526
OH NO,

8
00:00:28,779 --> 00:00:30,614

ANOTHER ONE OF YOU

11

DON'T YOU WANT TO SMILE?

15
00:00:51,802 --> 00:00:56,515
MANNY:
LOOKING AT YOU DOESN'T REALLY
MAKE ME FEEL LIKE SMILING.

EVERYONE'S TALKING ABOUT

34
00:02:02,873 --> 00:02:05,125
HOW YOU KICK SERIOUS
GYMNAST BUTT.

35
00:02:05,209 --> 00:02:06,126
HONESTLY?

36
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:08,086
PAIGE:
WELL, ONLY WHEN THEY'RE
NOT DISCUSSING

37
00:02:08,170 --> 00:02:11,131
YOUR INFINITELY MORE
FASCINATING PRIVATE LIFE.

00:02:11,215 --> 00:02:11,715
GREAT.

00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:14,218
DON'T WORRY HON,
IT'LL BLOW OVER.

40
00:02:14,301 --> 00:02:15,511
BUT, IN THE MEANWHILE,

41
00:02:15,594 --> 00:02:18,430
WHY DON'T YOU CONSIDER
RUNNING DAMAGE CONTROL.

42
00:02:18,514 --> 00:02:20,807
AND SWEETIE, YOU'RE
LOOKING A LITTLE PALE.

43
00:02:20,891 --> 00:02:22,559
IT'S NOT GOOD.

TOBY:
HEY, JIMMER!

50
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:39,785
WHAT'S REALLY GOOD?

51
00:02:39,868 --> 00:02:41,328
JIMMY:
NOTHING. DON'T CALL ME THAT.

52
00:02:41,411 --> 00:02:42,329
YOU IN OR WHAT, T?

53
00:02:42,412 --> 00:02:44,581
JT:
YEAH. SO IN, IT HURTS.

54
00:02:49,336 --> 00:02:50,420
MAN, I DON'T GET IT.

55
00:02:50,504 --> 00:02:51,755
JIMMY USED TO BE
MY FRIEND.

56
00:02:51,839 --> 00:02:53,674
YEAH, BUT THAT WAS BEFORE

57
00:02:53,757 --> 00:02:57,344
YOUR HOT STEPSIZZLE
DUMPED HIS AZZLE.

58
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:17,364
LOOK,
I KNOW YOU HATE ME...

59
00:03:17,447 --> 00:03:19,116
MANNY...

60
00:03:19,825 --> 00:03:21,326
JUST A SEC.

61
00:03:22,536 --> 00:03:24,371
I'M REALLY SORRY, OKAY?

62
00:03:24,454 --> 00:03:26,999
SORRY DOESN'T MAKE UP
FOR ALL THE PAIN YOU CAUSED.

63
00:03:27,082 --> 00:03:28,125
I KNOW.

64
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:31,461
BUT HE TOLD ME
I WAS THE ONE,

65
00:03:31,545 --> 00:03:32,504
I BELIEVED HIM.

66
00:03:32,588 --> 00:03:36,008
AND THAT'S THE ONLY REASON
I LET IT GO ON.

67
00:03:36,091 --> 00:03:38,510
CRAIG LIED TO ME TOO.

68
00:03:38,594 --> 00:03:41,763
AND I'D ERASE IT ALL
IF I COULD.

69
00:03:42,347 --> 00:03:43,348
(BELL RINGS)

70
00:03:44,141 --> 00:03:45,058
YOU'RE GOING TO BE
LATE.

71
00:03:52,691 --> 00:03:54,943
KWAN READING:
"THE CHIPS OF CHEWED BOATS

AND INTO THE SERINE
EXASPERATING SUNLIGHT THAT-"

76
00:04:05,662 --> 00:04:06,121
YES.

77
00:04:06,205 --> 00:04:07,372
MAY I BE EXCUSED?

78
00:04:07,456 --> 00:04:09,541
KWAN:
LET ME GUESS,
YOU'RE SICK TOO?

79
00:04:09,625 --> 00:04:12,252
MANNY, CHOOSING TO COME
TO SCHOOL ILL IS DESPERATELY...

80
00:04:12,336 --> 00:04:13,420
PLEASE!

81
00:04:40,697 --> 00:04:42,908
JIMMY:
I'VE BEEN STUDYING
LIKE A MANIAC.

82
00:04:42,991 --> 00:04:45,244
MARCO'S TUTORING ME,
AND EVEN SPINNER'S PASSING,

83
00:04:45,327 --> 00:04:46,954
BUT ALGEBRA'S STILL
KICKING MY BUTT.

84
00:04:47,037 --> 00:04:48,121
MID-TERMS
COME OUT FRIDAY.

85
00:04:48,205 --> 00:04:49,122
YEAH, I KNOW.

86
00:04:49,206 --> 00:04:51,333
MY DAD GOING TO FREAK
WHEN HE SEES MY GRADE.

87
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:52,543
PROBABLY GONNA CANCEL
THE CONCERT TRIP.

88
00:04:52,626 --> 00:04:54,127
TOBY
YO DAWG,
WHAT'S UP?

89
00:04:54,211 --> 00:04:56,129
YOU GOT ANY MORE TIX
FOR THAT CONCERT?

90
00:04:56,213 --> 00:04:57,965
I LOVE DJ CRAZY GUNS.

91
00:04:59,091 --> 00:05:01,218
JIMMY:
YOU MEAN,
DJ MADD BULLETZ?

92
00:05:02,803 --> 00:05:03,053
NO.

93
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:04,805
CAR SPACE'S TOO TIGHT.

94
00:05:04,888 --> 00:05:07,808
PLUS YOU DON'T EVEN LIKE RAP.

95
00:05:08,892 --> 00:05:12,062
TOBY:
WHAT IF A CERTAIN HOMEY
KNEW OF A HOLE

96
00:05:12,938 --> 00:05:14,940
IN THE SCHOOL'S FIREWALL -

97
00:05:15,023 --> 00:05:16,567
THE FIREWALL THAT PROTECTS
THE COMPUTER SYSTEM

98
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:18,151
WITH YOUR GRADES IN IT?

99
00:05:18,235 --> 00:05:20,112
JIMMY:
THEN I'D BUY HIM A MADD BULLETZ
CONCERT TICKET,

100
00:05:20,195 --> 00:05:22,698
AND GIVE HIM THE SHOTGUN SEAT.

101
00:05:23,907 --> 00:05:24,908
PEACE.

102
00:05:25,951 --> 00:05:26,910
OKAY.

103
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:33,208
EMMA:
HEY MANNY, WHAT'S WITH
THE MAD DASH OUT OF ENGLISH?

104
00:05:33,292 --> 00:05:34,459
NOTHING.

105
00:05:35,127 --> 00:05:39,089
YOU KNOW IF YOU'RE SICK,
YOU CAN'T COMPETE.

106
00:05:39,173 --> 00:05:40,090
OKAY.

107
00:05:40,757 --> 00:05:43,927
WHO DIED AND
MADE YOU MY MOTHER?

108
00:05:46,847 --> 00:05:48,932
COACH, SHOULD KNOW.

109
00:05:49,892 --> 00:05:50,809
EMMA! WAIT.

110
00:05:53,937 --> 00:05:55,981
MY LIFE SUCKS OKAY.

111
00:05:56,565 --> 00:05:59,818
THIS MEET MEANS
EVERYTHING TO ME.

112
00:06:00,861 --> 00:06:02,696
I'M JUST NERVOUS.

113
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:05,782
I'M JUST REALLY
NERVOUS, OKAY?

114
00:06:12,331 --> 00:06:13,165
(APPLAUSE)

115
00:06:13,916 --> 00:06:15,584
HATZILAKOS:
ALL RIGHT, GIRLS.

116
00:06:15,667 --> 00:06:18,212
OKAY, THIS OUR LAST PRACTICE,

117
00:06:18,295 --> 00:06:20,881
AND I WANNA SEE WHAT YOUR GONNA
BRING TO THE MEET TOMORROW.

118
00:06:20,964 --> 00:06:23,717
I WANT YOU TO FOCUS,
GIVE TWO HUNDRED PERCENT,

119
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,802
AND OF COURSE HAVE SOME FUN.

120
00:06:25,886 --> 00:06:28,639
SO WHO THINKS MANNY SHOULD
SHOW US HOW IT'S DONE?

121
00:06:28,722 --> 00:06:31,475
COME ON, MANNY! LET'S DO IT.

122
00:06:58,794 --> 00:06:59,628
(APPLAUSE)

123
00:07:01,171 --> 00:07:03,757
MANNY, I'VE GOT TO SAY,
THAT WAS INCREDIBLE.

124
00:07:03,841 --> 00:07:05,592
I TOLD YOU I WAS FINE.

125
00:07:05,676 --> 00:07:06,760
SO FINE, THAT YOU'RE
GOING TO WIN US

126
00:07:06,844 --> 00:07:10,305
THE GOLD MEDAL

127
00:07:10,389 --> 00:07:12,516
HEY, I HEARD
ABOUT MR. SIMPSON

128
00:07:12,599 --> 00:07:14,434
BEING IN THE HOSPITAL.

129
00:07:14,518 --> 00:07:15,435
SORRY.

130
00:07:15,519 --> 00:07:17,437
HE'S DOING FINE,
ACTUALLY.

131
00:07:17,521 --> 00:07:19,648
SOME MORE INTENSE CHEMO
MIGHT BE GOOD.

132
00:07:19,731 --> 00:07:22,067
IT'S AMAZING
THAT YOU'RE HERE

133
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:24,152
JUST GETTING ON WITH IT.

134
00:07:24,236 --> 00:07:24,862
YOU KNOW ME.

135
00:07:24,945 --> 00:07:27,155
I'M ALWAYS DOING SOMETHING.

136
00:07:27,239 --> 00:07:28,156
HAZEL:
FIFTY BUCKS TO ANYONE

137
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,492
WHO CAN GIVE ME A TAMPON

138
00:07:30,576 --> 00:07:31,577
WHAT HAPPENED?

139
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:32,786
HAZEL:
I CAN'T BELIEVE NO ONE NOTICED.

140
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:35,789
I JUST DID A FRONT WALKOVER
THAT BELONGS IN A HORROR MOVIE.

141
00:07:35,873 --> 00:07:37,291
FORGOT TO STOCK UP.

142
00:07:37,374 --> 00:07:38,208
OH, HERE.

143
00:07:39,001 --> 00:07:41,336
I HAVEN'T USED MINE

144
00:07:42,254 --> 00:07:42,880
REALLY?

145
00:07:43,589 --> 00:07:46,300

EMMA:
MANNY, I KNOW THIS IS TOTALLY
NONE OF MY BUSINESS,

149
00:07:56,226 --> 00:07:58,729
BUT YOU WERE SICK EARLIER
AND...

150
00:08:00,439 --> 00:08:03,567
ARE YOU SURE IT'S NOT,
SOMETHING ELSE?

151
00:08:04,902 --> 00:08:05,986
MANNY:
YOU'RE RIGHT.

152
00:08:07,237 --> 00:08:09,489
IT IS NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS.

153
00:08:20,459 --> 00:08:25,088
THREE, FOUR, FIVE, FOUR, FIVE,
SIX, SEVEN, EIGHT.

MANNY:
HOW DO I KNOW IF A GUY...

163
00:09:36,702 --> 00:09:38,370
IF HE USED A CONDOM?

164
00:09:38,871 --> 00:09:40,289
PAIGE:

YOU'RE SERIOUS?

169
00:09:59,808 --> 00:10:02,394
WELL, DID YOU, LIKE,
HEAR HIM OPEN IT?

170
00:10:02,477 --> 00:10:04,313
OR EVEN FEEL IT MAYBE?

171
00:10:05,314 --> 00:10:06,356
I DON'T KNOW.

172
00:10:07,024 --> 00:10:08,442
I DON'T THINK SO.

173
00:10:09,151 --> 00:10:11,069
WELL. OKAY. IT'S OKAY.

174
00:10:14,198 --> 00:10:17,201
IF YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT WHO
I THINK YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT?

175
00:10:17,284 --> 00:10:19,119
THEN I'M SURE YOU'RE FINE.

176

00:10:25,167 --> 00:10:26,335
OF COURSE NOT.

179
00:10:26,877 --> 00:10:28,128
BUT TO BE SURE,
