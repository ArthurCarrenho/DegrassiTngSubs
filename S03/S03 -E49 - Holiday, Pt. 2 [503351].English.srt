TO SAY ANYTHING.

207
00:11:57,634 --> 00:12:02,055
'CAUSE HE KNEW YOU'D BE UPSET
ABOUT HIM MOVING ON SO QUICKLY.

00:14:20,027 --> 00:14:21,069
YOU TOLD HER.

242
00:14:22,487 --> 00:14:23,197
NO.

243
00:14:24,323 --> 00:14:25,908
NO, I DIDN'T.

244
00:14:26,867 --> 00:14:28,952
WELL, THEN HOW DID
SHE FIND OUT?

245
00:14:29,036 --> 00:14:32,164
BECAUSE YOU WERE STUPID,
CRAIG.

246
00:14:32,247 --> 00:14:35,542
YOU DIDN'T THINK THAT
SHE'D FIND OUT ABOUT ME

247
00:14:35,626 --> 00:14:40,714
AND YOU DIDN'T THINK THAT
I'D FIND OUT ABOUT YOUR LIES.

248
00:14:55,354 --> 00:14:56,855
JOEY:
CRAIG.

249
00:15:00,484 --> 00:15:01,735
CRAIG, WAIT UP!

250
00:15:05,322 --> 00:15:06,490
HOLD UP!

251
00:15:09,368 --> 00:15:11,995
I WRECKED EVERYTHING,
OKAY,

252
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:14,122
AND I DON'T NEED A LECTURE.

253
00:15:14,206 --> 00:15:14,998
I DON'T WANT TO LECTURE YOU.

254
00:15:15,082 --> 00:15:18,710
I JUST WANT TO KNOW
WHAT'S HAPPENING.

255
00:15:20,546 --> 00:15:22,714
I CHEATED ON ASHLEY.

256
00:15:23,423 --> 00:15:24,967
OH CRAIG,
I THOUGHT YOU GUYS-

257
00:15:25,050 --> 00:15:27,511
JOEY, STOP.
STOP. I KNOW.

258
00:15:27,594 --> 00:15:31,098
AND NOW THE OTHER GIRL
HATES MY GUTS, TOO.

259
00:15:31,723 --> 00:15:33,308
SO MERRY CHRISTMAS.

260
00:15:46,196 --> 00:15:47,114
DID I EVER TELL YOU

261
00:15:47,197 --> 00:15:50,284
THAT CAITLIN AND I WERE
ENGAGED ONCE?

262
00:15:55,956 --> 00:15:58,083
THOUGHT I HAD IT ALL.

263
00:15:58,166 --> 00:16:01,253
BUT I WAS YOUNG AND STUPID,
AND I CHEATED ON HER

264
00:16:01,336 --> 00:16:04,756
WITH A GIRL NAMED
TESSA CAMPANELLI.

265
00:16:05,299 --> 00:16:07,676
CAITLIN FOUND OUT,

266
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:12,222
AND IT WAS ONE OF THE BIGGEST
REGRETS OF MY LIFE.

267
00:16:12,306 --> 00:16:13,015
SO?

268
00:16:13,724 --> 00:16:16,852

I- I KNOW IT DOESN'T
FEEL THAT WAY NOW,

271
00:16:21,982 --> 00:16:24,902
BUT TRUST ME,
YOU'LL BE OKAY.

272
00:16:25,819 --> 00:16:27,738
WHAT, LIKE YOU'RE OKAY?

273
00:16:27,821 --> 00:16:29,489

290
00:17:22,292 --> 00:17:25,462
SYD, I FEEL STRANGE EVEN
BRINGING THIS UP,

291
00:17:25,546 --> 00:17:27,214
BUT I HAVE TO.

292
00:17:28,465 --> 00:17:32,302
JOE, YOU'RE MAKING ME
NERVOUS OVER HERE.

293
00:17:34,596 --> 00:17:38,684
CRAIG SAID HE OVERHEARD YOU
TALKING TO CAITLIN YESTERDAY.

294
00:17:38,767 --> 00:17:39,059
OH?

295
00:17:41,603 --> 00:17:45,023
DID YOU SAY ANYTHING
TO MAKE HER GO AWAY?

296
00:17:47,192 --> 00:17:47,526
YES.

297
00:17:50,404 --> 00:17:52,155
AND WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT?

298
00:17:52,239 --> 00:17:53,615
BECAUSE EVERY TIME
I TURN AROUND

299
00:17:53,699 --> 00:17:55,659
THERE'S CAITLIN.

300
00:17:55,742 --> 00:17:58,078
SHE'S SUPPOSED TO BE
YOUR EX.

301
00:17:58,161 --> 00:17:58,745
SHE IS.

302
00:17:59,663 --> 00:18:00,414
YOU SURE?

303
00:18:04,293 --> 00:18:05,836
I'VE PUT A LOT INTO THIS,
JOE.

304
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:09,339
I WANT THIS TO WORK.
I NEED THIS TO WORK.

305
00:18:11,175 --> 00:18:12,759
BECAUSE I LOVE YOU.

306
00:18:18,849 --> 00:18:21,185
BUT YOU DON'T FEEL
THE SAME.

307
00:18:26,398 --> 00:18:26,732
SYD-

308
00:18:27,774 --> 00:18:29,943
THEN TELL ME
I'M YOUR FIRST CHOICE.

309
00:18:30,027 --> 00:18:33,197
TELL ME YOU LOVE ME
MORE THAN CAITLIN.

310
00:18:40,454 --> 00:18:40,954
RIGHT.

311
00:18:42,748 --> 00:18:44,583

HELLO, CAITLIN RYAN.

319
00:19:13,862 --> 00:19:14,821
JOEY?

320
00:19:15,739 --> 00:19:18,617
I'M ON THE PLANE.
I CAN'T TALK.

321
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:21,870
JOEY:
JUST LOOK OUT YOUR WINDOW.

322
00:19:43,141 --> 00:19:45,310
CAITLIN:
THEY GAVE ME THREE MINUTES.

323
00:19:45,394 --> 00:19:46,687
THIS BETTER BE GOOD.

324
00:19:46,770 --> 00:19:50,941
JOEY:
I DON'T WANT TO SPEND
CHRISTMAS WITHOUT YOU.

325
00:19:52,359 --> 00:19:53,735
CAITLIN:
BUT SYDNEY...

326
00:19:53,819 --> 00:19:55,654
IT'S NOT ABOUT SYDNEY.

327
00:19:56,697 --> 00:19:57,698
THAT'S OVER.

328
00:20:00,701 --> 00:20:02,536
IT'S ABOUT YOU AND ME.

329
00:20:07,541 --> 00:20:10,043
UH, ANGIE?
LET'S GO SEE SANTA.

330
00:20:12,254 --> 00:20:15,215

MAYBE SANTA WILL HAVE SOME
PRESENTS FOR DADDY.

331
00:20:15,299 --> 00:20:17,050
CRAIG:
WELL, IT LOOKS LIKE HE'S
GETTING HIS CHRISTMAS PRESENT

332
00:20:17,134 --> 00:20:18,468
EARLY THIS YEAR.

333
00:20:19,469 --> 00:20:20,137
CAITLIN...

334
00:20:22,014 --> 00:20:26,476
WHEN I BROKE YOUR HEART
ALL THOSE YEARS AGO,

335
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:29,605
I WAS SURE THAT
I'D LOST YOU FOREVER,

336
00:20:29,688 --> 00:20:31,398
AND I MOVED ON.

337
00:20:33,901 --> 00:20:35,694
AND YET HERE YOU ARE,

338
00:20:35,777 --> 00:20:38,363
STANDING IN AN AIRPORT
AT CHRISTMAS...

339
00:20:38,447 --> 00:20:39,615
WITH ME.

340
00:20:40,657 --> 00:20:42,409
YEAH, WITH YOU.

341
00:20:47,122 --> 00:20:48,540
I MOVED ON,

342
00:20:50,709 --> 00:20:53,212
BUT I NEVER REALLY LEFT.

343
00:21:08,393 --> 00:21:13,440
I GUESS I SHOULD GET MY STUFF
OFF THAT PLANE THEN, HUH?

344
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:23,951
MERRY CHRISTMAS.
