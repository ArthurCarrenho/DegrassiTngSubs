8
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:21,021
SPOILED MUCH?

9
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:22,064
IF MY PARENTS REALLY
WANTED TO SPOIL ME

10
00:00:22,064 --> 00:00:23,690
THEY'D LET ME CANCEL,
RIGHT?

11
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:24,900
BECAUSE WHEN THEY BOOKED
IN DECEMBER -

12
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:26,902
YEAH.
OKAY, IT WAS COOL,

13
00:00:27,361 --> 00:00:28,362
BUT THAT WAS
BEFORE YOU.

14
00:00:30,656 --> 00:00:32,824
PAIGE:
AND THE FINAL SACRIFICE -

15
00:00:32,824 --> 00:00:36,411
LAST FALLS WAY PASSE MASCARA

16
00:00:36,411 --> 00:00:41,166
SPINNER:
AND HONEYBEE'S EXILE TO THE
WASTELAND IS OFFICIALLY OVER.

17
00:00:41,166 --> 00:00:43,001
WELL, THAT'S WORTH
CELEBRATING.

18
00:00:43,001 --> 00:00:44,294
JIMMY:
IT IS.

19
00:00:44,294 --> 00:00:45,838
AND TONIGHT IS GONNA
BE A DREAM,

20
00:00:45,838 --> 00:00:48,382
A NIGHT THAT YOU'LL

21
00:00:48,382 --> 00:00:49,842
HAZEL:
YOU GOT US A LIMO?

22
00:00:49,842 --> 00:00:50,884
JIMMY:
WELL, WE NEED SOMETHING
TO GET US

23
00:00:50,884 --> 00:00:52,302
FROM MY PLACE
TO THE RESTAURANT.

24
00:00:52,302 --> 00:00:54,388
OH AND BY THE WAY,
MEAL'S ON ME.

25
00:00:54,388 --> 00:00:57,391

00:00:59,393 --> 00:01:01,812
OH, AREN'T YOU

28
00:01:01,812 --> 00:01:03,230

00:01:58,452 --> 00:01:59,453
HAVE A SEAT.

42
00:02:00,662 --> 00:02:02,664
I THOUGHT SCHOOL WAS OVER.

43
00:02:08,462 --> 00:02:10,547
SIMPSON:
YOU STARTED THE YEAR OFF WELL,

44
00:02:10,547 --> 00:02:13,467
BUT YOUR GRADE
JUST KEPT DROPPING.

45
00:02:13,467 --> 00:02:15,177
AND GIVEN THAT YOU'RE ON
STUDENT WELFARE-

46
00:02:15,177 --> 00:02:16,470
SEAN:

47
00:02:17,054 --> 00:02:20,557
TILL THEY FIND OUT
I FAILED A COURSE.

48
00:02:22,309 --> 00:02:23,352
THANKS A LOT, MR. SIMPSON.

49
00:02:23,352 --> 00:02:25,771
SIMPSON:

50
00:02:25,771 --> 00:02:27,481
BY END OF DAY.

51
00:02:28,232 --> 00:02:31,485
DO A GOOD JOB,
AND YOU DON'T FAIL.

52
00:02:38,575 --> 00:02:40,494

00:03:03,642 --> 00:03:05,394
THERE YOU GO.

61
00:03:05,811 --> 00:03:06,979
YOU ARE A MODEL
OF EFFICIENCY.

62
00:03:06,979 --> 00:03:07,980
JOEY:
YEAH. IF I WAS,

63
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:11,233
I WOULD HAVE BEEN BACK AT WORK
TWENTY MINUTES AGO.

64
00:03:11,233 --> 00:03:13,026
CAITLIN:
WE'RE LIKE TWO PEAS IN A POD.

65
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:15,529
WELL, YOU SHOULD MOVE
INTO THIS POD.

66
00:03:19,533 --> 00:03:20,325
SERIOUSLY.

67
00:03:21,994 --> 00:03:23,787
YOU'RE ALREADY A HUGE
PART OF THE KIDS LIVES.

68
00:03:23,787 --> 00:03:26,540
I KNOW THEY WOULD LOVE IT
IF YOU MOVED IN.

69
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:28,876
MORE IMPORTANTLY,
I WOULD LOVE IT.

70
00:03:28,876 --> 00:03:29,376
WHOA.

71
00:03:30,836 --> 00:03:32,337
THIS IS SUDDEN.

72
00:03:32,337 --> 00:03:33,547
THINK ABOUT IT.

73
00:03:33,547 --> 00:03:36,842
YOUR STUFF IS HERE
AND... YOU SHOULD BE TOO.

74
00:03:38,552 --> 00:03:40,179
I GOT TO GET
TO THIS MEETING.

75
00:03:40,179 --> 00:03:43,390

AH, JIMMY...

79
00:03:52,316 --> 00:03:53,775
YOU COMING OUT
OF THE BATHROOM?

80
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,988
JIMMY:
UM, THIS THING DOESN'T
FIT RIGHT.

81
00:03:57,988 --> 00:04:00,282
MAYBE CAUSE YOU'RE
WEARING A SARI?

82
00:04:00,282 --> 00:04:01,700
YOU WERE SUPPOSED
TO ASK FOR A KURTA -

83
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:03,160
WHAT INDIAN MEN WEAR.

84
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:04,244
JIMMY:
NO, NO.

85
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:07,623
BECAUSE I ASKED FOR
TWO KURTAS AND TWO SARIS...

86
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:11,960
AND THEY GAVE ME
THREE SARIS.

87
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:15,130
AND YOU DIDN'T CHECK
BEFORE YOU LEFT THE STORE?

88
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:17,132
SLOPPY WORK, DUDE.

89
00:04:25,849 --> 00:04:28,227

00:04:28,227 --> 00:04:29,853
SPINNER:
(SNICKER) YEAH DUDE,

91
00:04:29,853 --> 00:04:32,856

00:04:32,856 --> 00:04:33,607
(SARCASTIC LAUGHTER)

93
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:35,609
I'VE NEVER BEEN
IN A LIMO BEFORE.

94
00:04:35,609 --> 00:04:37,027
DO WE GET CHAMPAGNE,

95
00:04:37,027 --> 00:04:38,237
I HOPE SO.

96
00:04:39,613 --> 00:04:40,822

99
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:05,180
I THINK THERE'S

100
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:06,640
YOU JIMMY BROOKS?

101
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,642
AIN'T NO MISTAKE,
HOUND DOG.

00:05:08,642 --> 00:05:09,726
LET'S GIDDY-UP.

103
00:05:23,532 --> 00:05:25,701
NO, NO,
LADIES FIRST.

104
00:05:27,661 --> 00:05:29,621
I LIKE YOUR HAT.

105
00:05:31,123 --> 00:05:32,624
WATCH YOUR DRESS.

106
00:05:45,679 --> 00:05:47,347
TOMAS:
HIS AND HERS TOWELS?

107
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:49,683
JOEY ASKED ME TO MOVE IN

108
00:05:49,683 --> 00:05:51,685
AND THE TOWELS ARE SAYING,

109
00:05:51,685 --> 00:05:54,688
"WHY YES, I WOULD LOVE TO,
MR. JEREMIAH."

110
00:05:55,689 --> 00:05:57,274
THIS IS WHERE YOU SAY CONGRATS.

111
00:05:57,274 --> 00:05:58,942
I WAS JUST ABOUT TO...

112
00:05:58,942 --> 00:06:01,445
FOR AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT
REASON.

113
00:06:01,445 --> 00:06:03,363
THE DOCUMENTARY SERIES ON
UNICEF'S WORK WITH HIV/AIDS?

114
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:05,699
THE STATION GAVE US 
THEIR ANSWER TODAY.

115
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:06,825
THEY SAID YES?!

116
00:06:06,825 --> 00:06:08,243
CONGRATULATIONS!

117
00:06:11,747 --> 00:06:14,708
WE SUBMITTED THAT WHAT,
A YEAR AGO.

118
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:17,252
IT'S FOR GENEVA.
LEAVING TONIGHT.

119
00:06:17,252 --> 00:06:18,420
EXCUSE ME?

120
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:19,004

00:06:20,714 --> 00:06:21,882
AND YOU'RE OFF TO AFRICA,

123
00:06:21,882 --> 00:06:24,718
INDIA, SOUTHEAST ASIA,
THE CARIBBEAN.

124
00:06:24,718 --> 00:06:27,846
IT'LL BE A HECTIC
NINE MONTHS.

125
00:06:27,846 --> 00:06:29,264
I...I CAN'T.

126
00:06:32,726 --> 00:06:33,727
SORRY.

127
00:06:35,729 --> 00:06:38,315
THIS IS YOUR PROJECT.
IT'S YOUR BABY.

128
00:06:38,315 --> 00:06:40,275
THE MAN I LOVE
ASKED ME TO MOVE IN

129
00:06:40,275 --> 00:06:42,110
AND I'M NOT GOING
TO TURN HIM DOWN.

130
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:44,738
NOT FOR THIS,
NOT FOR ANYTHING.

131
00:06:55,123 --> 00:06:58,752
SIMPSON:
THE DATABASE
SEEMS TO BE WORKING.

132
00:06:58,752 --> 00:07:00,337
THERE'S A COUPLE OF
REDUNDANCIES IN THE TABLES,

133
00:07:00,337 --> 00:07:02,923
BUT UH...
THAT'S AN EASY FIX.

134
00:07:02,923 --> 00:07:04,132
SO...

135
00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:11,807
53.

136
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:16,186
NOT THE BEST MARK,
BUT IT'S A PASS.

137
00:07:16,186 --> 00:07:17,604
NICE WORK, SEAN.

138
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:20,566
THANK YOU, MR. SIMPSON.

139
00:07:20,566 --> 00:07:21,066

140
00:07:21,817 --> 00:07:23,277
OH, YIKES!
IT'S 6:00 P.M.

141
00:07:23,277 --> 00:07:26,321
I'M CHAPERONING
YOUR PARTY TONIGHT.

142
00:07:26,321 --> 00:07:28,240
I'M NOT GOING.
IT'S NOT MY SCENE.

143
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:31,660
A GOOD TIME'S 
NOT YOUR SCENE?

144
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:32,661
SEAN, LIFE CAN BE ROUGH,

145
00:07:32,661 --> 00:07:35,789
AND I KNOW YOU'VE BEEN DEALT
SOME CRAPPY HANDS.

146
00:07:35,789 --> 00:07:39,793
BUT IT CAN ALSO BE PRETTY
AMAZING IF YOU LET IT.

147
00:07:39,793 --> 00:07:41,044
MR. SIMPSON...

148
00:07:41,044 --> 00:07:41,879
SIMPSON:
YOU USED TO COME TO ME
WITH PROBLEMS,

149
00:07:41,879 --> 00:07:44,756
AND I'D TRY AND HELP OUT.

150
00:07:44,756 --> 00:07:46,758
YOU DON'T ANYMORE.
THAT'S COOL.

151
00:07:46,758 --> 00:07:48,802
IT'S YOUR BUSINESS.

152
00:07:49,386 --> 00:07:52,973
BUT IT DOESN'T MEAN
I'VE GIVEN UP ON YOU.

153
00:07:52,973 --> 00:07:56,810
I'LL ALWAYS BE HERE
FOR YOU, SEAN.

154
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:58,687
I STOLE YOUR COMPUTER.

155
00:08:01,899 --> 00:08:04,318
YOUR ALIENWARE LAPTOP.

156
00:08:04,902 --> 00:08:07,279
I STOLE IT 
TO GET BACK AT EMMA.

157
00:08:07,279 --> 00:08:07,821
BUT I...

158
00:08:10,616 --> 00:08:11,700
I LOST IT.
MY...

159
00:08:11,992 --> 00:08:13,493
MY CHEMO...

160
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:16,496
IT WASN'T YOUR CHEMO,
AND YOU DIDN'T LOSE IT.

161
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:17,414
I STOLE IT.

162
00:08:18,457 --> 00:08:19,249
AND I'M SORRY.

163
00:08:21,585 --> 00:08:22,669
I'M SO SORRY.

WHEN WE SKIPPED SCHOOL,

172
00:09:03,418 --> 00:09:05,420
WE ALSO SKIPPED OUT

173
00:09:08,423 --> 00:09:09,550
