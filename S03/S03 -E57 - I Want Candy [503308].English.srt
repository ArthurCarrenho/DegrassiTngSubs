1
00:00:01,710 --> 00:00:04,505
HATZILAKOS:
SO YOUR EXAM WILL MAINLY FOCUS
ON SECOND TERM.

2
00:00:04,588 --> 00:00:06,256
BUT MUCH OF WHAT YOU LEARNED
LAST FALL

3
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:09,009
HAS INFLUENCED WHAT
WE'VE COVERED SINCE AND-

4
00:00:09,092 --> 00:00:10,010
WAIT.

5
00:00:10,093 --> 00:00:13,013
SO WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
WE HAVE TO STUDY BOTH TERMS?

6
00:00:13,096 --> 00:00:15,015
HATZILAKOS:
THAT'S USUALLY HOW IT WORKS,
GAVIN.

7
00:00:15,098 --> 00:00:15,933
SO WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO-

8
00:00:16,016 --> 00:00:16,850
MORE WORK?

9
00:00:17,351 --> 00:00:19,853
HATZILAKOS:
IT'S A COMPREHENSION
ASSIGNMENT.

10
00:00:19,937 --> 00:00:22,564
USING MOLECULAR MODELS,
I'D LIKE YOU TO ILLUSTRATE

11
00:00:22,648 --> 00:00:26,235

MOLECULES BY NEXT WEEK.

12
00:00:26,318 --> 00:00:28,237
(MURMURS FROM THE CLASS)

13
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:31,114
HATZILAKOS:
WELCOME TO THE REAL WORLD,
GUYS.

14
00:00:31,198 --> 00:00:34,201
OH AND PAIGE, CAN YOU MAKE SURE
THAT ASHLEY GETS THIS?

15
00:00:34,284 --> 00:00:37,454
SEEMS LIKE SHE'S SICK AGAIN.

16
00:00:37,538 --> 00:00:41,542
OKAY, I CAN'T HANDLE THIS.
IT'S SO UNFAIR.

17
00:00:42,501 --> 00:00:45,045
HATZILAKOS WANTS US TO LIVE
IN THE REAL WORLD?

18
00:00:45,128 --> 00:00:47,673
THEN I SAY WE DO JUST THAT.

19
00:00:47,756 --> 00:00:51,134

PAIGE:
YES, DYLAN.

32
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:45,898
THIS CAR MEANS MORE
TO YOU THAN I DO.

33
00:01:45,981 --> 00:01:48,609
OKAY, NOW THIS GOES
TO MISS SMITH,

34
00:01:48,692 --> 00:01:50,569
EXCUSING ME FROM ALL CLASSES

36
00:01:53,614 --> 00:01:54,031
NICE.

37
00:01:55,199 --> 00:01:56,450
JUST MAKE SURE SHE GETS IT.

38
00:01:56,533 --> 00:01:58,577
AND YOU MAKE SURE YOU RETURN
THIS CAR, OKAY?

39
00:01:58,660 --> 00:01:59,494

40
00:02:00,704 --> 00:02:02,039

41
00:02:02,748 --> 00:02:03,874

43
00:02:17,888 --> 00:02:19,932
MRS. MASON:
HERE.

44
00:02:20,015 --> 00:02:22,059
NOW I KNOW HAVING A THERMOMETER
IN YOUR MOUTH IS UNCOMFORTABLE,

45
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:24,186
BUT YOU GOTTA LEAVE IT THERE,
OKAY?

46
00:02:24,269 --> 00:02:26,438
OKAY, MOM. I LOVE YOU.

47
00:02:26,522 --> 00:02:27,231
OH.

48
00:02:37,241 --> 00:02:39,076
JUST WAIT TILL I TELL MOM.

49
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:44,331
OH YEAH, GO RIGHT AHEAD,

51
00:02:52,464 --> 00:02:54,007
WITH A TEMPERATURE OF 101?

52
00:02:54,091 --> 00:02:55,384
I DON'T THINK SO.

53
00:02:55,467 --> 00:02:56,844
OH THE PAIN.

54
00:02:56,927 --> 00:02:57,511
KENDRA:
PAIN?

55
00:02:57,594 --> 00:02:58,887
I'M THE ONE IN PAIN.

56
00:02:58,971 --> 00:02:59,304

57
00:02:59,388 --> 00:03:01,181
MRS. MASON:
KENDRA, THIS ISN'T
A COMPETITION.

58
00:03:01,265 --> 00:03:02,516
NOW I'LL BE HOME BY FIVE.

59
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:04,226
YOU BE SURE TO DRINK
LOTS OF FLUIDS

60
00:03:04,309 --> 00:03:06,186
AND CALL ME AT WORK
IF YOU NEED ANYTHING.

61
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:07,771
KENDRA:
BUT...

62
00:03:17,239 --> 00:03:18,198
PAIGE?

63
00:03:18,282 --> 00:03:20,534
THE HEN HAS FLOWN THE COUPE.

64
00:03:20,617 --> 00:03:21,034
NICE.

65
00:03:27,833 --> 00:03:29,001
SIMPSON:
IN CONSTRUCTING
THIS SEQUEL QUERY

66
00:03:29,084 --> 00:03:31,587
WE NEED TO USE A FILTER AS IN...

67
00:03:32,462 --> 00:03:35,507

THAN 100."

68
00:03:35,591 --> 00:03:37,301
NO, THAT'S NOT RIGHT.

69
00:03:40,345 --> 00:03:42,681

71
00:03:45,309 --> 00:03:47,394
UH, THAT'D BE A NO.

72
00:03:47,477 --> 00:03:49,563
I WAS THINKING ABOUT
ASKING MANNY,

73
00:03:49,646 --> 00:03:53,275
BUT, I MEAN, I KNOW SHE'S BEEN
THROUGH SOME TOUGH TIMES LATELY-

74
00:03:53,358 --> 00:03:54,902
SIMPSON:
TIME'S GONNA GET A WHOLE
LOT TOUGHER

75
00:03:54,985 --> 00:03:56,904
IF YOU DON'T STOP TALKING.

76
00:03:56,987 --> 00:03:58,071

00:20:06,331 --> 00:20:07,583
(RELIEVED SIGH)

349
00:20:09,209 --> 00:20:10,127
(DEEP SIGH)

350
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:17,885
DR. MORAGODA:
NURSE GRANT WILL SET UP
YOUR FOLLOW-UPS.

351
00:20:17,968 --> 00:20:19,303
CONGRATULATIONS.

352
00:20:23,223 --> 00:20:26,059
UH, TAKE AS MUCH TIME
AS YOU NEED IN HERE.

353
00:20:26,143 --> 00:20:30,147
GOOD, 'CAUSE I THINK
WE'RE GONNA BE AWHILE.

354
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:36,361
KATE:
I WORRY ABOUT YOU ALL DAY

355
00:20:36,445 --> 00:20:39,114
SO I CANCEL A HOUSE SHOWING
SO I CAN BE WITH YOU

356
00:20:39,198 --> 00:20:40,991
AND THEN I FIND YOU
PULLING UP IN PAIGE'S CAR

357
00:20:41,074 --> 00:20:43,785
WITH THE WORLD'S WEIRDEST
TROPHY.

358
00:20:44,745 --> 00:20:46,997
(ELVIS VOICE) I'M SORRY,
LITTLE LADY. (GIGGLES)

359
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:49,249
ASHLEY, THIS IS NOT FUNNY!

360
00:20:49,917 --> 00:20:50,584
(LAUGHS)

361
00:20:59,092 --> 00:20:59,760
(LAUGHS)

362
00:21:01,261 --> 00:21:04,097
ASHLEY'S SANITY HAS LEFT
THE BUILDING.

363
00:21:04,181 --> 00:21:05,349
(LAUGHS)

364
00:21:08,185 --> 00:21:09,853
SPINNER:
(ELVIS VOICE)
THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

365
00:21:09,937 --> 00:21:11,855
PAIGE:
OKAY, THAT WAS A WORSE
IMPERSONATION

366
00:21:11,939 --> 00:21:13,398
THAN THAT MINI-E KID.

367
00:21:13,482 --> 00:21:14,316
(LAUGHTER)

368
00:21:14,858 --> 00:21:15,943
OH, TIME TO PICK UP DYLAN.

369
00:21:16,026 --> 00:21:18,987
HE'S GOING TO KILL ME
IF I'M LATE.

370
00:21:19,071 --> 00:21:21,198
SPINNER:
YEAH, NOT TO MENTION...

371
00:21:21,281 --> 00:21:22,574
FOR THIS.

372
00:21:23,450 --> 00:21:25,244
WHICH HE WILL NEVER
KNOW ABOUT.

373
00:21:25,327 --> 00:21:28,747
SMALL PRICE TO PAY
FOR A DAY OFF, RIGHT?
