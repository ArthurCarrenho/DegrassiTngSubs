WHAT IF IT'S MORE SERIOUS?

351
00:16:53,472 --> 00:16:55,140
EMMA, WOULD YOU STOP
THINKING THE WORST?

352
00:16:55,224 --> 00:16:56,558
I'M OVER-TIRED,
I'M OVER-WORKED,

353
00:16:56,642 --> 00:16:59,311
AND I- I'VE GOT A COLD.
SO WHAT?

354
00:17:03,190 --> 00:17:05,150
THAT'S ALL IT IS, OKAY?

355
00:17:05,984 --> 00:17:07,819
OKAY, I'M SORRY.

356
00:17:30,342 --> 00:17:31,760
HI, THIS IS ARCHIE SIMPSON,

357
00:17:31,844 --> 00:17:36,265
I'D LIKE TO MAKE AN APPOINTMENT
WITH DOCTOR MORAGODA.

358
00:17:36,932 --> 00:17:39,017
4:30? THIS AFTERNOON, UM...

359
00:17:42,396 --> 00:17:43,480
OKAY. THANKS.

360
00:17:47,526 --> 00:17:48,360
(LAUGHTER)

361
00:17:49,778 --> 00:17:52,406
MARCO:
AND THIS FILM IS ABOUT
THIS WOMAN IN A COMA, RIGHT?

362
00:17:52,489 --> 00:17:55,367
AND HER MALE NURSE
IS HOT FOR HER.

363
00:17:55,450 --> 00:17:56,285
(LAUGHTER)

364
00:17:56,368 --> 00:17:58,412
FOR A CHICK IN A COMA?

365
00:17:58,495 --> 00:18:01,164
THAT'S WHAT I'M SAYING?
IT'S DYSFUNCTIONAL.

366
00:18:01,248 --> 00:18:02,082
(LAUGHTER)

367
00:18:03,375 --> 00:18:06,086
HAZEL:
IT SOUNDS HILARIOUS.

368
00:18:06,879 --> 00:18:10,048
SO YOU WANT TO SEE IT AGAIN?
WE COULD GO TOGETHER.

369
00:18:10,132 --> 00:18:13,802
UH, (NERVOUS LAUGH)
YEAH, SOUNDS GOOD.

370
00:18:14,761 --> 00:18:19,641
UM, I'M GETTING KINDA DRY,
DOES ANYONE WANT ANOTHER DRINK?

371
00:18:19,725 --> 00:18:20,726
ON ME?

372
00:18:20,809 --> 00:18:21,852
OKAY.

373
00:18:21,935 --> 00:18:23,937
(EXASPERATED SIGH)

374
00:18:25,939 --> 00:18:27,024
HE'S SO CUTE.

375
00:18:28,901 --> 00:18:30,986
SPINNER:
MAYBE HE NEEDS A LITTLE...
HELP.

376
00:18:31,069 --> 00:18:31,904
HAZEL:
OH.

377
00:18:38,952 --> 00:18:43,707
THOUGHT YOU MIGHT NEED SOME
HELP WITH THOSE DRINKS.

378
00:18:48,921 --> 00:18:49,922
MARCO?

379
00:18:51,590 --> 00:18:52,591
SORRY.

380
00:19:14,196 --> 00:19:16,240
DUDE, JUST IGNORE HER.

381
00:19:16,323 --> 00:19:17,658
TOTALLY.

382
00:19:17,741 --> 00:19:19,034
WE SHOULD ALL GO TO THAT MOVIE.

383
00:19:19,117 --> 00:19:21,078
YOU DON'T LIKE SUBTITLES,
SPIN, BUT...

384
00:19:21,161 --> 00:19:23,580
PAIGE:
(LAUGHS)
YEAH, THEY INVOLVE READING.

385
00:19:23,664 --> 00:19:29,795
HAZEL:
BUT IT MIGHT BE COOL, YOU KNOW,
ALL OF US, FREAKY COMA STORY.

386
00:19:29,878 --> 00:19:30,796
I GOTTA GO.

387
00:19:33,549 --> 00:19:37,511
MY MOM'S MAKING MARINARA SAUCE,
AND I ALWAYS HELP HER.

388
00:19:37,594 --> 00:19:41,974
UH THANKS, HAZEL.
IT'S JUST GETTING KINDA LATE.

389
00:19:51,817 --> 00:19:53,402
DID I DO SOMETHING?

390
00:20:11,044 --> 00:20:12,087
SO DOC, SINCE WHEN HAS
BLOOD-LETTING

391
00:20:12,171 --> 00:20:15,299
BECOME A CURE FOR THE COMMON
COLD, HUH?

392
00:20:15,382 --> 00:20:17,092
DR. MORAGODA:
I WISH IT WERE THAT TRIVIAL.

393
00:20:17,176 --> 00:20:19,219
OH BUT THERE'S NOTHING
TRIVIAL ABOUT A COLD.

394
00:20:19,303 --> 00:20:20,929
SNEEZING, SNIFFLING...

395
00:20:21,013 --> 00:20:25,976
I HAVE TO DO MORE TESTS
AND UH, A BONE MARROW BIOPSY.

396
00:20:27,477 --> 00:20:28,896
BONE MARROW? WHY?

397
00:20:30,439 --> 00:20:34,735
BECAUSE YOUR SYMPTOMS ALL POINT
TO ACUTE MYELOID LEUKEMIA.

398
00:20:34,818 --> 00:20:36,486
CANCER OF THE BLOOD.

399
00:20:38,238 --> 00:20:39,907
CANCER? BUT UH...

400
00:20:39,990 --> 00:20:42,576
DR. MORAGODO:
IT'S A SCARY WORD, I KNOW,

401
00:20:42,659 --> 00:20:45,704
BUT LIKE I SAID WE HAVE
TO RUN MORE TESTS.

402
00:20:45,787 --> 00:20:48,665
THE IMPORTANT THING IS,
IF IT IS CANCER,

403
00:20:48,749 --> 00:20:53,253
WE'VE CAUGHT IT EARLY,
AND WE CAN BEAT IT, OKAY?

404
00:20:57,257 --> 00:20:58,842
SPINNER:
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

405
00:20:58,926 --> 00:21:00,385
LEAVE ME ALONE SPIN.

406
00:21:00,469 --> 00:21:02,471
YOU JUST WALKED OUT
ON YOUR DATE WITH HAZEL.

407
00:21:02,554 --> 00:21:02,763
SHE'S SITTING THERE-

408
00:21:02,846 --> 00:21:04,515
I MEAN IT, SPIN!
PLEASE, BACK OFF!

409
00:21:04,598 --> 00:21:05,724
WHAT'S GOING ON?!
WHAT IS YOUR-

410
00:21:05,807 --> 00:21:06,975
YOU WON'T UNDERSTAND.

411
00:21:07,059 --> 00:21:09,019
WHAT, THAT YOU'RE PSYCHO?

412
00:21:09,102 --> 00:21:10,020
YOU JUST WALKED OUT
ON A DATE

413
00:21:10,103 --> 00:21:11,605
WITH ONE OF DEGRASSI'S
COOLEST GIRLS

414
00:21:11,688 --> 00:21:14,066
FOR YOU MOM'S PASTA SAUCE?
IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.

415
00:21:14,149 --> 00:21:15,275
YES, IT DOES.

416
00:21:15,359 --> 00:21:17,653
SPINNER:
OH YEAH? THEN STOP CRYING
AND EXPLAIN IT TO ME,

417
00:21:17,736 --> 00:21:18,820
'CAUSE I'M OBVIOUSLY A MORON
AND DON'T GET IT.

418
00:21:18,904 --> 00:21:20,489
JUST BECAUSE,
SPIN.

419
00:21:20,572 --> 00:21:21,448
BECAUSE WHY?!

420
00:21:21,532 --> 00:21:23,367
BECAUSE I'M GAY.

421
00:21:32,876 --> 00:21:34,169
(CRYING)
