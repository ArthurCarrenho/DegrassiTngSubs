MANNY:

00:00:06,715 --> 00:00:08,175
I HOPE IT'S A GIRL.

4
00:00:08,258 --> 00:00:10,928
ANGIE'S ALWAYS
WANTED A SISTER.

5
00:00:11,011 --> 00:00:12,846
I THINK SHE'D BE
THE BABY'S AUNT?

6
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:13,972
AT SEVEN?

7
00:00:14,056 --> 00:00:15,224
IT'S SO WEIRD.

PAIGE:
SO, THAT LOOKED RATHER COZY.

14
00:00:41,124 --> 00:00:42,417
I GATHER EVERYTHING WAS PEACHY,

15
00:00:42,501 --> 00:00:45,879
WHEN YOU ASKED THE FAMOUS
CONDOM QUESTION?

16
00:00:45,963 --> 00:00:46,463
MANNY:
NO.

17
00:00:48,882 --> 00:00:50,217

ASHLEY:
HOW COULD HE DO THAT?

22
00:01:10,487 --> 00:01:12,155

00:01:13,156 --> 00:01:15,617
ASHLEY
YOU'RE NEVER GOING TO BELIEVE

25
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:19,830
HE'S ACTUALLY GOING

26
00:01:19,913 --> 00:01:21,331
IT MIGHT BE WORSE.

27
00:01:21,415 --> 00:01:23,584
AS IF IT COULD BE.

28
00:01:23,667 --> 00:01:26,587

00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:07,020
NO.

59
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:11,191
ANYONE NAMED MAUDE WILL PICK

00:03:34,089 --> 00:03:36,842
THESE TWO IDIOTS...

69
00:03:36,925 --> 00:03:37,551
THAT'S RIGHT.

70
00:03:37,634 --> 00:03:41,805
BECAUSE IS WAY TOO DIFFICULT
TO USE A CONDOM

71
00:03:43,182 --> 00:03:46,143
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU SLEPT WITH HER.

72
00:03:50,439 --> 00:03:52,566
TERRI:
MANNY'S SO LUCKY.

73
00:03:52,649 --> 00:03:54,318
BABIES ARE BUNDLES OF LOVE.

00:03:54,401 --> 00:03:56,111
I'M ALMOST JEALOUS.

75
00:03:56,195 --> 00:03:59,823

00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:04,411
BUT THIS IS THE MOST LOSERISH
MOVE EVER.

79
00:04:04,494 --> 00:04:06,538
SHE'S GONNA BE SOMEBODY'S MOM.

80
00:04:06,622 --> 00:04:08,373
SHE'S TOTALLY RUINING HER LIFE,

81
00:04:08,457 --> 00:04:10,792
AND PROBABLY HER FIGURE.

82
00:04:10,876 --> 00:04:12,085

I WISH YOU COULD'VE
TALKED TO ME.

87
00:04:40,239 --> 00:04:43,575
YOU WEREN'T EXACTLY INTERESTED
IN HEARING ABOUT ME AND CRAIG.

88
00:04:43,659 --> 00:04:45,285
MOM'S AT THE SALON LATE

100
00:05:19,236 --> 00:05:20,946
WHY I OUGHTA...

101
00:05:22,239 --> 00:05:23,699
OKAY, NEWSFLASH.

102
00:05:23,782 --> 00:05:26,451
I DON'T WANT TO GO OUT
WITH YOU.

103
00:05:26,535 --> 00:05:27,911
BECAUSE OF MANNY?

104
00:05:31,707 --> 00:05:34,168

OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT,
LIBERTY?

107
00:05:38,213 --> 00:05:39,798
THIS THREE YEAR CRUSH

108
00:05:39,882 --> 00:05:42,134
IS GETTING A LITTLE BORING.

109

110
00:05:51,268 --> 00:05:53,937

114
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:10,996
(LAUGHING)
DON'T USE THAT NAME.

115
00:06:13,874 --> 00:06:17,711
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU'RE

116
00:06:23,133 --> 00:06:23,383

BECAUSE I CANNOT DEAL
WITH TELLING MINE.

119
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,976
MY MOM'S AMAZING.

120
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,436
I CAN'T BELIEVE SHE WENT
THROUGH EVERYTHING

121
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:37,606
YOU'RE GOING THROUGH
JUST TO HAVE ME.

178
00:09:39,788 --> 00:09:41,707
I'M GONNA BE A DAD.
NO SCHLEBOGGLE.

179
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:42,916
NO, I'M NOT.

180
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,668
SPINNER:
WHERE IS YOU FUTURE, DUDE?

181
00:09:44,751 --> 00:09:48,213
I MEAN, NO KEG PARTIES,
NO SPRING BREAK IN FLORIDA.

182
00:09:48,297 --> 00:09:51,091
FOR ONCE I WANT TO DO
THE RIGHT THING, YOU KNOW?

183
00:09:51,175 --> 00:09:52,634
BUT YOU DON'T HAVE
TO KEEP THE KID.

184
00:09:52,718 --> 00:09:54,887
THERE ARE OTHER THINGS
YOU CAN DO.

185
00:09:54,970 --> 00:09:58,932
THIS, THIS IS WHAT
I WANT TO DO, SPIN.

186
00:09:59,016 --> 00:10:00,434
YOU DON'T GET IT.

187
00:10:00,517 --> 00:10:02,686
NO, I DON'T...
AT ALL.

188
00:10:06,023 --> 00:10:08,609
YOU'VE GOT A FAMILY,
ALL RIGHT?

189
00:10:09,651 --> 00:10:12,487
I JUST, I STAY
AT SOME GUYS HOUSE.

190
00:10:13,363 --> 00:10:15,699
BUT MANNY AND THE BABY...

191
00:10:17,659 --> 00:10:18,702
THEY'RE MINE.

192
00:10:21,246 --> 00:10:22,539
THEY'RE FOR ME.

193
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:29,505
(KNOCKING)

194
00:10:36,803 --> 00:10:38,555
SPIKE:
MANNY. DEJA VU.

195
00:10:39,348 --> 00:10:42,893
MANNY:
I COULDN'T CONCENTRATE
IN CLASS.

196
00:10:42,976 --> 00:10:45,312
SPIKE:
MAKE YOURSELF A SPACE.

197
00:10:47,523 --> 00:10:50,150
I WANT TO KNOW WHAT
BEING A SINGLE MOM

198
00:10:50,234 --> 00:10:51,527
IS REALLY LIKE?

199
00:10:54,071 --> 00:10:57,658
SPIKE
MAYBE JUGGLING SIX THINGS
ALL AT ONCE...

200
00:10:57,741 --> 00:10:59,660
PLUS ALL SIX THINGS
ARE ON FIRE,

201
00:10:59,743 --> 00:11:02,746
AND YOU'RE STANDING UP,
RIDING A BUS.

202
00:11:02,829 --> 00:11:05,541
AND YOU CAN'T STOP FOR
AT LEAST TWELVE YEARS.

203
00:11:05,624 --> 00:11:07,668
THAT SOUNDS HORRIBLE.

204
00:11:07,751 --> 00:11:10,754
SPIKE:
BUT YOU GET STICKY
CANDY KISSES

205
00:11:10,838 --> 00:11:14,299
AND CHRISTMAS ORNAMENTS MADE OUT
OF TOILET PAPER ROLLS.

206
00:11:14,383 --> 00:11:14,883
GREAT.

207
00:11:16,593 --> 00:11:19,680
LOTS OF WOMEN RAISE KIDS
ON THEIR OWN.

208
00:11:19,763 --> 00:11:23,308
BUT DOING IT AT FOURTEEN
WAS EXTRA HARD.

209
00:11:23,392 --> 00:11:27,354
ALL MY FRIENDS WENT OFF TO
COLLEGE, UNIVERSITY, EUROPE,

210
00:11:27,437 --> 00:11:28,939
BUT I STAYED HOME.

211
00:11:33,193 --> 00:11:35,195
I WANT TO STUDY FASHION.

212
00:11:36,905 --> 00:11:39,825
YOU KNOW, MAYBE NEW YORK
OR PARIS.

213
00:11:41,159 --> 00:11:42,995
THAT SOUNDS WONDERFUL.

214
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:45,789
MANNY:
BUT CRAIG WANTS ME TO KEEP IT.

215
00:11:49,168 --> 00:11:51,795
SPIKE:
AND HE'S ALWAYS GONNA BE THERE?

216
00:11:55,132 --> 00:11:58,886
ULTIMATELY,
THE RESPONSIBILITY IS YOURS.

217
00:11:58,969 --> 00:12:02,723
SO THE DECISION IS YOURS,
NO ONE ELSE'S.

218
00:12:04,057 --> 00:12:04,808
YOU MEAN...

219
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:10,647
I DON'T HAVE TO DO THIS
IF I DON'T WANT TO?

220
00:12:21,742 --> 00:12:22,451
YOU LIKE?

221
00:12:24,244 --> 00:12:24,953
UH...

222
00:12:26,038 --> 00:12:27,456
JT:
WELL, WELL, WELL.

223
00:12:27,539 --> 00:12:29,499
LET ME GUESS.

224
00:12:29,583 --> 00:12:31,043
HALLOWEEN'S EARLY.

225
00:12:31,126 --> 00:12:32,544
OR ARE YOU PLAYING RIZZO

226
00:12:32,628 --> 00:12:35,130
IN THE DRAMA CLUB PRODUCTION
OF GREASE?

227
00:12:35,214 --> 00:12:38,550
LIBERTY:
ACTUALLY, I WASN'T GOING FOR
A VENERATION OF THE 50s.

228
00:12:38,634 --> 00:12:40,511
PERHAPS I WAS SUBCONSCIOUSLY
INSPIRED

229
00:12:40,594 --> 00:12:44,097
BY SEAN'S MASTERLY WORK
ON OUR ASSIGNMENT.

230
00:12:44,598 --> 00:12:47,434
WORK I LOOK FORWARD
TO CONTINUING.

231
00:12:54,024 --> 00:12:55,442
WHAT IS GOING ON?

232
00:12:55,526 --> 00:12:56,735
YOU'RE THE REBOUND CRUSH.

233
00:12:56,818 --> 00:12:57,486
SEAN:
WHAT?

234
00:12:57,569 --> 00:12:59,404
NO. NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

235
00:13:00,197 --> 00:13:01,532
ON A CERTAIN LEVEL,

236
00:13:01,615 --> 00:13:02,658
I'M RELIEVED.

237
00:13:03,492 --> 00:13:04,910
BUT ON ANOTHER?

238
00:13:04,993 --> 00:13:06,370
I FEEL YOUR PAIN.

239
00:13:11,917 --> 00:13:13,418
THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY
OUT OF THIS.

240
00:13:13,502 --> 00:13:15,212
YOU'VE GOT TO BE BRUTAL.

241
00:13:15,295 --> 00:13:19,132
THE WORD HINT IS NOT
IN LIBERTY'S VOCAB.

242
00:13:34,106 --> 00:13:35,357
MOM, I DON'T-

243
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,900
I DON'T WANT A SANDWICH.

244
00:13:36,984 --> 00:13:41,154
JULIETTA:
CHEESE AND TOMATO.
YOU LOVE IT.

245
00:13:41,238 --> 00:13:42,614
WE CAN WAIT FOR DADDY?

246
00:13:42,698 --> 00:13:43,866
MANNY:
NO, NO.

247
00:13:45,117 --> 00:13:45,951
IT'S OKAY.

248
00:13:47,703 --> 00:13:51,039
MOM, I JUST SAW
DR. JOHNSON AND...

249
00:13:56,003 --> 00:13:58,005
MOM, I'M PREGNANT.

250
00:14:00,716 --> 00:14:03,552
OKAY, I, I DON'T CARE
WHAT YOU SAY.

251
00:14:03,635 --> 00:14:05,429
AND I DON'T CARE WHAT DAD SAYS,
OKAY?

252
00:14:05,512 --> 00:14:06,638
MANUELLA.

253
00:14:06,722 --> 00:14:09,641
MANNY:
I'M NOT A LITTLE GIRL
ANYMORE.

254
00:14:09,725 --> 00:14:12,269
AND I'M NOT GOING AWAY
LIKE MARY HAD TO.

255
00:14:12,352 --> 00:14:14,313
JULIETTA:
STOP, PLEASE.

256
00:14:14,396 --> 00:14:15,439
IT'S A SHOCK.

257
00:14:16,398 --> 00:14:18,233
I KNOW, AND I'M SORRY.

258
00:14:21,653 --> 00:14:22,321
(CRYING)

259
00:14:23,864 --> 00:14:26,575
MOM...
I'VE THOUGHT ABOUT IT.

260
00:14:28,368 --> 00:14:29,536
AND I CAN'T GO AWAY.

261
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:31,079
I CAN'T BE PREGNANT.

262
00:14:31,163 --> 00:14:34,291
I CAN'T BE,
I CAN' BE A MOM YET.

263
00:14:34,374 --> 00:14:36,418
WHAT ELSE CAN I DO?

264
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:37,628
(CRYING)

265
00:14:39,213 --> 00:14:41,548
MOMMY,
I'M SO SORRY...

266
00:14:42,549 --> 00:14:44,134
I'M SO SORRY...

267
00:14:59,107 --> 00:15:01,693
JAY:
THAT NEON PLATE HOLDER
IS SWEET.

268
00:15:01,777 --> 00:15:05,280
LIBERTY:
ALL YOUR FAVOURITES, SEAN.

269
00:15:05,364 --> 00:15:06,406
WHAT DO YOU SAY
WE DITCH SCHOOL

270
00:15:06,490 --> 00:15:08,534
AND GO CHILL
IN THE RAVINE?

271
00:15:08,617 --> 00:15:09,284
LIBERTY.

272
00:15:09,826 --> 00:15:12,204
I CAN GET US A FIVE-FINGER
DISCOUNT ON A PACK OF SMOKES.

273
00:15:12,287 --> 00:15:14,373
A FIVE FINGER DISCOUNT?
(LAUGHING)

274
00:15:14,456 --> 00:15:16,625
OH, I'M EDGY.
I'M ON FIRE.

275
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:21,505
LIBERTY, YOU'RE ABOUT AS
EDGY AS A BUTTER KNIFE.

276
00:15:21,588 --> 00:15:22,714
I'M NOT INTERESTED IN YOU,

277
00:15:22,798 --> 00:15:23,841
AND I NEVER WILL BE.

278
00:15:23,924 --> 00:15:24,967
GOT IT?

279
00:15:29,555 --> 00:15:31,056
JAY:
HEY MAN, YOU SHOULD GO FOR IT.

280
00:15:31,139 --> 00:15:34,977
I MEAN, I HEAR SHE'S REALLY
GREAT... AT CHESS.

281
00:15:36,061 --> 00:15:37,062
(JAY LAUGHS)

282
00:15:52,536 --> 00:15:53,996
HEY EM,
YOUR MOM HOME?

283
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:55,539
SHE'S UPSTAIRS.
IT'S JACK'S BATH TIME.

284
00:15:55,622 --> 00:15:56,957
WHAT'S GOING ON?

285
00:15:57,791 --> 00:16:00,669
MY MOM WAS SO MUCH BETTER THAN
I EVER THOUGHT SHE'D BE.

286
00:16:00,752 --> 00:16:02,337
WHAT A HUGE RELIEF.

287
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:03,755
YOU'RE NOT KIDDING.

288
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:06,967
I THOUGHT I WAS GOING TO WET
MY PANTS BEFORE I TOLD HER,

289
00:16:07,050 --> 00:16:08,802
BUT THEN IT JUST CAME OUT.

290
00:16:08,886 --> 00:16:12,306
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?
SHE'S EVEN DRIVING ME.

291
00:16:12,848 --> 00:16:13,348
EMMA:
WHERE?

292
00:16:15,767 --> 00:16:18,353
SHE'S DRIVING ME
TO THE CLINIC.

293
00:16:18,979 --> 00:16:20,981
I'M GETTING AN ABORTION.

294
00:16:23,358 --> 00:16:24,193
YOU CAN'T.

295
00:16:26,278 --> 00:16:28,071
LOOK, I KNOW YOU THINK
IT'S WRONG.

296
00:16:28,155 --> 00:16:30,199
AND YOUR CHILD WOULD TOO.

297
00:16:31,909 --> 00:16:34,286
MANNY:
I'M JUST TRYING TO DO
THE RIGHT THING HERE...

298
00:16:34,369 --> 00:16:34,953
FOR ME.

299
00:16:36,371 --> 00:16:38,957
YOU KNOW, FOR EVERYONE,
I GUESS.

300
00:16:40,125 --> 00:16:41,960
I WOULDN'T WANT TO GIVE A BABY
SOME CRAPPY LIFE

301
00:16:42,044 --> 00:16:43,045
WITH A MOM WHO ISN'T READY.

302
00:16:43,128 --> 00:16:46,757
YEAH. WELL AT LEAST
IT WOULD HAVE A LIFE!

303
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:48,133
WHAT ABOUT ADOPTION?

304
00:16:48,217 --> 00:16:50,469
THERE ARE AGENCIES
WITH GREAT COUNSELLORS.

305
00:16:50,552 --> 00:16:54,097
MANNY:
I KNOW, BUT I CAN'T GO
THROUGH GIVING BIRTH.

306
00:16:54,181 --> 00:16:55,307
IT'S SO TERRIFYING.

307
00:16:55,390 --> 00:16:56,600
AND THEN GOING TO SCHOOL HUGE,

308
00:16:56,683 --> 00:16:57,684
AND EVERYONE KNOWS ABOUT IT.

309
00:16:57,768 --> 00:16:59,311
YOU CAN GET THROUGH
ALL THAT.

310
00:16:59,394 --> 00:17:01,021
MANNY:
I CAN'T.

311
00:17:01,104 --> 00:17:01,772
I SWEAR.

312
00:17:02,606 --> 00:17:03,774
I'M FOURTEEN.

313
00:17:05,734 --> 00:17:06,777
EMMA, PLEASE.

314
00:17:08,278 --> 00:17:10,906
PLEASE,
YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND.

315
00:17:12,908 --> 00:17:15,744
MY MOM WILL BE DOWN
IN A MINUTE.

316
00:17:26,839 --> 00:17:27,923
KWAN:
DOES ANYONE ELSE HAVE
AN EXAMPLE

317
00:17:28,006 --> 00:17:30,676
OF THE SYMBOLISM
IN MOBY DICK?

318
00:17:30,759 --> 00:17:31,927
ANYONE?

319
00:17:32,427 --> 00:17:35,180
HOW ABOUT YOU MR. MASON?

320
00:17:35,264 --> 00:17:38,141
SPINNER:
WELL, UM... THERE'S THE OCEAN.

321
00:17:38,225 --> 00:17:42,354
KWAN:
OKAY. WHY DON'T YOU EXPAND
ON THAT FOR US.

322
00:17:42,437 --> 00:17:45,524
SPINNER:
UM... OKAY,
WATER REPRESENTS LIFE.

323
00:17:46,525 --> 00:17:49,361
IN MOBY DICK ISHMAEL,
HE GOES ON THE SHIP...

324
00:17:49,444 --> 00:17:52,114
LOOKING FOR THE MEANING
OF LIFE.

325
00:17:53,532 --> 00:17:54,533
(BELL RINGS)

326
00:18:01,164 --> 00:18:02,833
THERE SHE IS!

327
00:18:02,916 --> 00:18:04,418
DON'T CRAIG.

328
00:18:05,127 --> 00:18:06,837
CRAIG:
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

329
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:08,755
I CAN'T DO THIS.

330
00:18:09,798 --> 00:18:11,592
I THOUGHT I COULD,

331
00:18:11,675 --> 00:18:14,720
BUT HAVING A BABY NOW
IT'S JUST...

332
00:18:14,803 --> 00:18:17,097
YOU'RE NOT MAKING
ANY SENSE.

333
00:18:17,181 --> 00:18:20,809
SOMEDAY, YOU'RE GONNA
BE A GREAT DAD.

334
00:18:22,102 --> 00:18:24,813
AND SOMEDAY
I HOPE I'LL BE A MOM.

335
00:18:25,772 --> 00:18:28,358
BUT NOW,
NOW ISN'T SOMEDAY YET.

336
00:18:33,906 --> 00:18:34,156
NO.

337
00:18:36,408 --> 00:18:37,659
NO, YOU'RE NOT.

338
00:18:38,452 --> 00:18:39,453
MANNY, STOP!

339
00:18:40,329 --> 00:18:41,747
NO, I WON'T LET YOU!

340
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:42,414
MANNY:
PLEASE!

341
00:18:43,290 --> 00:18:43,790
CRAIG!

342
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,668
CRAIG:
EMMA, YOU BUTT OUT.

343
00:18:46,752 --> 00:18:47,794
WHAT SHE'S DOING IS WRONG.

344
00:18:47,878 --> 00:18:49,838
I AGREE WITH YOU, OKAY?

345
00:18:52,090 --> 00:18:53,509
IF SHE WAS JUST SOME STRANGER,

346
00:18:53,592 --> 00:18:55,344
I WOULD BE FURIOUS WITH HER.

347
00:18:55,427 --> 00:18:57,638
BUT SHE'S MY FRIEND,

348
00:18:57,721 --> 00:18:59,389
AND IT'S HER CHOICE.

349
00:19:00,849 --> 00:19:01,975
BUT IT'S MY BABY.

350
00:19:02,059 --> 00:19:05,479
EMMA:
AND MANNY'S BODY.
WHAT ABOUT HER?

351
00:19:05,562 --> 00:19:07,397
MANNY:
I JUST, I JUST...

352
00:19:09,650 --> 00:19:10,317
I CAN'T.

353
00:19:23,705 --> 00:19:24,540
THANK YOU.

354
00:19:47,688 --> 00:19:49,731
I'LL FINISH THE PROJECT
AND PUT YOUR NAME ON IT.

355
00:19:49,815 --> 00:19:51,650
DON'T WORRY.

356
00:19:51,733 --> 00:19:52,067
HEY...

357
00:19:53,193 --> 00:19:54,611
LIBERTY:
I SHOULD'VE KNOWN.

358
00:19:54,695 --> 00:19:56,154
YOU'RE JAMES DEAN,

359
00:19:56,238 --> 00:19:57,614
I'M JUST SOME
SQUARE GIRL

360
00:19:57,698 --> 00:20:00,993
THAT NOBODY EVER ASKS
TO THE SOCK HOP.

361
00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:04,079
WHAT IF SOMEBODY DID
WANT TO ASK YOU OUT?

362
00:20:04,162 --> 00:20:05,998
HA. NOBODY LIKES ME.

363
00:20:06,081 --> 00:20:07,749
SOMEBODY DOES.

364
00:20:08,292 --> 00:20:09,251
AND YOU HAVE TO FORGIVE ME

365
00:20:09,334 --> 00:20:13,046
OR HE SAYS HE'S GONNA KNOCK
MY TEETH OUT.

366
00:20:20,053 --> 00:20:23,223
YEAH, HE'S GOT THIS
SMART GIRL THING.

367
00:20:23,307 --> 00:20:27,477
HE LIKED THE WAY YOU SAID
VENERATION AND MASTERLY.

368
00:20:37,404 --> 00:20:39,114
COUNSELLOR:
ALL RIGHT THEN.

369
00:20:39,198 --> 00:20:41,783
DO YOU HAVE ANY LAST QUESTIONS?

370
00:20:43,827 --> 00:20:45,162
MANNY:
UM... IS-

371
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:47,789
WILL IT HURT?

372
00:20:47,873 --> 00:20:48,874
MAYBE A LITTLE.

373
00:20:48,957 --> 00:20:51,335
LIKE THE CRAMPS YOU HAVE
WHEN IT'S YOUR PERIOD.

374
00:20:51,418 --> 00:20:52,586
AND IT'S SAFE?

375
00:20:53,253 --> 00:20:54,421
SHE'LL BE OKAY?

376
00:20:54,505 --> 00:20:55,631
COUNSELLOR:
AS THE CONSENT FORM STATES,

377
00:20:55,714 --> 00:20:57,174
THERE IS SOME RISK OF
COMPLICATION.

378
00:20:57,257 --> 00:21:00,511
BUT IT'S VERY LOW,
ABOUT THREE PERCENT.

379
00:21:01,303 --> 00:21:03,472
SO, IF YOU'RE READY...

380
00:21:15,567 --> 00:21:18,278
UM, HOW WILL I FEEL...
AFTER?

381
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:21,365
COUNSELLOR:
EVERYBODY FEELS DIFFERENTLY.

382
00:21:21,448 --> 00:21:23,534
LOTS OF WOMEN CRY
A LITTLE.

383
00:21:23,617 --> 00:21:25,661
MANY FEEL RELIEVED.

384
00:21:25,744 --> 00:21:27,704
AS LONG AS YOU'RE SURE
OF YOUR DECISION, THEN...

385
00:21:27,788 --> 00:21:29,456
I'LL BE OKAY.
