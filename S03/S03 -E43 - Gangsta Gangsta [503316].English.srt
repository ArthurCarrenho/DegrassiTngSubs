00:20:17,801 --> 00:20:19,595
HOW COULD YOU DO THAT?

355
00:20:19,678 --> 00:20:20,679
ME?

356
00:20:20,762 --> 00:20:23,432
WHAT ABOUT THE WAY
YOU'VE BEEN ACTING?

357
00:20:23,515 --> 00:20:25,934
YOU TOLD THEM I HAD
A WET DREAM OVER LIBERTY.

358
00:20:26,018 --> 00:20:29,021
YOU TREATED ME LIKE
CRAP FOR NO REASON.

359
00:20:29,104 --> 00:20:31,023
YOU STOOD ME UP FOR LUNCH,

360
00:20:31,106 --> 00:20:34,276
YOU ACT LIKE I'M
SOME BIG LOSER.

361
00:20:34,902 --> 00:20:37,112
WHAT DID I DO TO YOU?

362
00:20:37,196 --> 00:20:38,113
LOOK...

363
00:20:39,198 --> 00:20:42,784
THEY'RE MY FRIENDS,
YOU'RE MY FRIEND.

364
00:20:44,453 --> 00:20:46,413
BUT YOU AND THEM...

365
00:20:47,497 --> 00:20:49,583
NEVER GONNA HAPPEN.

366
00:20:50,125 --> 00:20:50,876
NO.

367
00:20:57,925 --> 00:20:58,425
TOBES...

368
00:20:59,426 --> 00:21:01,178
TOBES. TOBES! WAIT UP.

369
00:21:01,261 --> 00:21:04,431
LET'S HAVE LUNCH
TOGETHER TODAY, OKAY?

370
00:21:07,476 --> 00:21:09,019
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

371
00:21:09,102 --> 00:21:09,811
MY...

372
00:21:11,063 --> 00:21:12,981
MY NEW LAPTOP, I...

373
00:21:13,774 --> 00:21:17,569
I THOUGHT I LEFT IT
LOCKED IN HERE LAST NIGHT...

374
00:21:17,653 --> 00:21:21,907
I MEAN, I KNOW THE CHEMO'S
MAKING ME STUPID BUT...

375
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:25,410
I CAN'T BELIEVE
I ACTUALLY LOST IT.

376
00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:32,000
EMMA:
MAYBE IT'S NOT THE CHEMO.
