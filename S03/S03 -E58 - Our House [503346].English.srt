GUESS THIS IS IT.

182
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:10,194
I WAS THINKING...

183
00:10:10,277 --> 00:10:13,697
LONG DISTANCE RELATIONSHIPS
ARE BRUTAL BUT-

184
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:15,115
WE DON'T HAVE
TO WORRY ABOUT THAT.

185
00:10:15,199 --> 00:10:18,285
I LOVE HOW YOU
FIND THIS FUNNY.

186
00:10:25,626 --> 00:10:26,376
YOU'RE STAYING?

187
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:27,377

191
00:11:15,008 --> 00:11:17,344
GOT A SARI PICKED OUT?

192
00:11:18,345 --> 00:11:19,054
NO.

193
00:11:19,847 --> 00:11:22,099
I'VE GOT MY SWEAT PANTS
AND ICE CREAM PICKED OUT

194
00:11:22,182 --> 00:11:24,309
'CAUSE I'M NOT GOING.

195
00:11:24,393 --> 00:11:26,103
I DISAGREE.

196
00:11:26,186 --> 00:11:28,188
YOU CAN'T DISAGREE.

197
00:11:28,272 --> 00:11:29,690
I'M NOT GOING.

198
00:11:29,773 --> 00:11:32,442
BESIDES IT'S NOT LIKE
ANYONE WANTS ME THERE.

199
00:11:32,526 --> 00:11:34,444
I KNOW SOMEONE WHO DOES.

200
00:11:34,528 --> 00:11:37,322
OKAY, IT BETTER NOT JUST
BE YOU.

IT'S A CERTAIN, SHALL WE SAY,
"FRIEND" OF YOURS.

00:11:49,042 --> 00:11:50,544
YOU MEAN JT?

204
00:11:52,212 --> 00:11:54,548
WELL, IS HE GONNA ASK ME?

205
00:11:54,631 --> 00:11:57,384
YOU DIDN'T HEAR IT FROM ME.

206
00:12:01,263 --> 00:12:03,473
SO THE GOVERNMENT PAYS YOU
FOR NOTHING?

207
00:12:03,557 --> 00:12:05,475
I GOTTA GO TO SCHOOL,

WELL, MAYBE NOT MONTHS.
WE'LL MISS THE DANCE.

320
00:19:14,571 --> 00:19:16,406
WAS THAT A YES?

321
00:19:16,490 --> 00:19:20,494
I HEARD A YES.
CAN WE GET A RULING ON THAT?

322
00:19:20,577 --> 00:19:22,955
JT, YOU'RE SUCH A JERK.

323

334
00:20:15,591 --> 00:20:17,050
I HAD A PARTY.

335
00:20:17,134 --> 00:20:18,343
AND...

336
00:20:18,427 --> 00:20:20,804
IT SORTA GOT OUT OF HAND.

337
00:20:20,888 --> 00:20:22,639
THE COPS WERE CALLED.

338
00:20:22,723 --> 00:20:24,975
NO CHARGES OR ANYTHING BUT...

339
00:20:25,642 --> 00:20:27,394
WELL, IF YOU DON'T WANT
TO BE MY TRUSTEE ANYMORE

340
00:20:27,477 --> 00:20:28,562

345
00:20:43,493 --> 00:20:46,246

THAT THE PARTYING IS OVER

346
00:20:46,330 --> 00:20:48,582

347
00:20:49,499 --> 00:20:49,917
