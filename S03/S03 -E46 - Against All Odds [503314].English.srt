ONE OF SHAKESPEARE'S
MOST QUOTABLE PLAYS,

00:00:17,684 --> 00:00:19,394
JULIUS CAESAR.

6
00:00:19,478 --> 00:00:21,480
WHO CAN SPEAK TO HIS THEMES?

7
00:00:21,563 --> 00:00:21,939
SEAN?

8
00:00:23,607 --> 00:00:23,941
HUH?

00:00:24,942 --> 00:00:26,527
CAN YOU SPEAK TO THE PLAY'S
THEMES?

10
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:28,403
I MEAN, ARE THEY
STILL RELEVANT?

11
00:00:28,487 --> 00:00:29,238
RELEVANT?

12
00:00:30,405 --> 00:00:33,033
SHAKESPEARE'S SOME DEAD
OLD WHITE GUY

13
00:00:33,116 --> 00:00:34,701
FROM 500 YEARS AGO.

14
00:00:35,327 --> 00:00:37,162
WHAT DOES HE KNOW ABOUT
MY LIFE?

15
00:00:37,246 --> 00:00:37,913
NOTHING.

16
00:00:39,957 --> 00:00:41,333

OKAY.

17
00:00:41,917 --> 00:00:42,918

CHRIS.

19
00:00:44,545 --> 00:00:45,879
CHRIS:
I LOVED IT.

20
00:00:45,963 --> 00:00:47,548
IT WAS ALL ABOUT BETRAYAL,

21
00:00:47,631 --> 00:00:49,675
LOYALTY, POWER, JEALOUSY.

22
00:00:50,467 --> 00:00:51,677

NO FLIRTING WITH, YOU KNOW,
MONTREAL BOYS, OKAY?

39
00:01:58,368 --> 00:02:00,287
I'M TAKING ELLIE
FOR SOME R'N'R.

40
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:00,787
SHE'S HAD A HARD TIME

41
00:02:00,871 --> 00:02:03,790
AND SHE IS DEFINITELY NOT
SHOPPING FOR GUYS,

42
00:02:03,874 --> 00:02:04,666
AND NEITHER AM I.

43
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:07,419
CAUSE I'VE GOT
THE CUTEST ONE THERE IS.

44
00:02:07,503 --> 00:02:08,712
ELLIE:
I PACKED TOO MUCH.

45
00:02:08,795 --> 00:02:10,714
I ALWAYS PACK TOO MUCH.

46
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:12,466
YOU NEED SOME HELP?

47
00:02:12,549 --> 00:02:13,634
I'LL SEE YOU IN HOMEROOM.

00:02:18,222 --> 00:02:19,431
MANNY:

50
00:02:19,515 --> 00:02:21,433
HEY, HOW ARE YOU?

51
00:02:22,392 --> 00:02:24,895
UH, I'M GOOD. HOW ARE YOU?

52
00:02:24,978 --> 00:02:26,396
I MISS YOU.

53
00:02:27,064 --> 00:02:28,982
THERE'S REALLY NOT MUCH
TO MISS, MANNY.

54
00:02:29,066 --> 00:02:32,110
I MEAN, WE ONLY HOOKED UP
ONCE.

55
00:02:36,573 --> 00:02:40,077
THERE'S A RAVE TONIGHT,
SOUNDS SLAM.

56
00:02:40,744 --> 00:02:44,122
I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT WANNA...
JUST COME.

57
00:02:44,206 --> 00:02:46,124
NO STRINGS, OKAY?

58
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:52,381
CHRIS: (ROBOTIC VOICE)
LADIES AND GENTLEMAN...
CHRIS SHARPE,

00:02:52,464 --> 00:02:55,175

(RAPS)

61
00:03:07,062 --> 00:03:09,189
I GRADED YOUR TESTS.

62
00:03:09,273 --> 00:03:12,693
SOME RESULTS WERE
DISAPPOINTING.

63
00:03:12,776 --> 00:03:14,945
SOME WERE APPALLING.

64
00:03:16,947 --> 00:03:20,033
AND SOME WERE QUITE IMPRESSIVE.

65
00:03:20,617 --> 00:03:22,035
OKAY, YOU'VE GOT ANOTHER TEST
MONDAY.

66
00:03:22,119 --> 00:03:27,291
SO PLEASE SOME OF YOU TAKE
THE TIME TO STUDY THIS WEEKEND.

67
00:03:27,374 --> 00:03:30,210
WANNA SLEEP OVER TONIGHT?
HIT THE BOOKS?

68
00:03:30,294 --> 00:03:31,253
YEAH.

69
00:03:32,421 --> 00:03:35,048
MARCO, YOU IN?
HELP US STUDY?

70
00:03:35,132 --> 00:03:36,383
MARCO:
UH, YEAH, SURE.

71
00:03:36,466 --> 00:03:39,303
ANYTHING FOR MY TWO
FAVORITE GUYS.

72
00:03:41,388 --> 00:03:42,181
WHAT?

73
00:03:42,264 --> 00:03:43,807
HE CAN TOTALLY HELP US.

74
00:03:43,891 --> 00:03:45,726
NO,
MARCO'S NOT THAT SMART.

75
00:03:45,809 --> 00:03:46,727
WHAT?

76
00:03:47,477 --> 00:03:48,937
HE'S QUITE SURPRISINGLY
STUPID.

77
00:03:49,021 --> 00:03:51,648
AN IDIOT.
A MORON IF YOU WILL.

78
00:03:51,732 --> 00:03:54,359
YOU'RE A MORON, OKAY,
AND HE'S COMING.

79
00:03:54,443 --> 00:03:56,528
OKAY, MARCO MAY BE SMART.

80
00:03:56,612 --> 00:03:58,906
BUT I MEAN, STUDYING ALL NIGHT?

81
00:03:58,989 --> 00:04:00,574
SLEEPING OVER?

82
00:04:00,657 --> 00:04:01,950
JIMMY:
YOUR FRIEND'S GAY.

83
00:04:02,034 --> 00:04:03,160
STOP HATING AND JUST DEAL.

84
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:05,204
HEY, I DON'T HATE.
I DO DEAL.

85
00:04:05,287 --> 00:04:08,123
OKAY, I'M TOTALLY FINE
WITH MARCO'S GAY-OSITY.

86
00:04:08,207 --> 00:04:08,624
GOOD.

87
00:04:09,333 --> 00:04:10,918
OKAY, CAUSE I FORGOT
TO TELL YOU?

88
00:04:11,001 --> 00:04:14,171
YOU TWO ARE SHARING A ROOM,
LOVER BOY.

89
00:04:17,216 --> 00:04:19,510
CHRIS:
EMMA, WHAT'S UP?

90
00:04:19,593 --> 00:04:21,011
HEY, MANNY.

91
00:04:21,637 --> 00:04:23,847
CHRIS, I REALLY LIKED
WHAT YOU SAID IN CLASS TODAY.

92
00:04:23,931 --> 00:04:26,099
I NEVER THOUGHT OF
JULIUS CAESAR THAT WAY.

93
00:04:26,183 --> 00:04:27,559
IT WAS SMART.

94
00:04:27,643 --> 00:04:29,645
THANKS.
UH, LATER!

95
00:04:32,523 --> 00:04:33,649
OH CHRIS SHARPE,

96
00:04:33,732 --> 00:04:37,069
I DO DECLARE
I'M IN LOVE WITH YOU!

97
00:04:37,736 --> 00:04:39,238
HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT?

98
00:04:39,321 --> 00:04:43,700
I COULD'VE SWORN I READ
SOMEONE'S NAME ON HERE.

99
00:04:44,368 --> 00:04:46,453
WOULD YOU LOOK AT THAT?
DJ JACOB SHARPE.

100
00:04:46,537 --> 00:04:47,746
JACOB SHARPE?

101
00:04:47,829 --> 00:04:49,373
CHRIS' COUSIN.

102
00:04:49,456 --> 00:04:53,418
AND I HEAR HE ALWAYS LETS
CHRIS SPIN A SET.

103
00:04:53,502 --> 00:04:54,962
EMMA:
I HAVE NO CHANCE WITH CHRIS.

104
00:04:55,045 --> 00:04:56,964
IT'S LIKE HE'S ON A DIFFERENT
PLANET OR SOMETHING.

105
00:04:57,047 --> 00:04:58,549
A COOL PLANET.

106
00:04:58,632 --> 00:05:01,093
I'M ON PLANET
WHITE DORK.

107
00:05:01,176 --> 00:05:02,803
HM. NOT TONIGHT.

108
00:05:02,886 --> 00:05:03,887
YOU LOOK HOT.

109
00:05:03,971 --> 00:05:05,180
EMMA:
I CAN'T WEAR THIS.

110
00:05:05,264 --> 00:05:06,390
EVERYONE IS GOING TO
STARE AT ME.

111
00:05:06,473 --> 00:05:08,892
MANNY:
INCLUDING HIM,
AND THAT'S GOOD.

112
00:05:08,976 --> 00:05:11,436
SEE YOU GOT TO DO WHATEVER
IT TAKES.

113
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,313
WHEN DID YOU BECOME
AN EXPERT ON ALL THIS?

114
00:05:13,397 --> 00:05:14,648
MANNY:
I'M NOT AN EXPERT.

115
00:05:14,731 --> 00:05:15,732
I JUST KNOW.

116
00:05:16,275 --> 00:05:17,150
WHATEVER IT TAKES?

117
00:05:17,234 --> 00:05:18,068
MANNY:
YES.

118
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:22,447
NOW STOP TALKING BEFORE
I PUT LIP-GLOSS ON YOUR TEETH.

119
00:05:22,531 --> 00:05:23,866
OKAY, RUB.

120
00:05:24,658 --> 00:05:25,993
ALL RIGHT.

121
00:05:27,995 --> 00:05:29,746
OKAY. LET'S GO.

122
00:05:30,372 --> 00:05:31,707
ALL RIGHT.

123
00:05:36,211 --> 00:05:38,005
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

124
00:05:38,088 --> 00:05:40,465
EXPLAINING THE BOOTYLICIOUS
MAKEOVER TO MY MOM

125
00:05:40,549 --> 00:05:42,134
IS SO NOT WORTH IT.

126
00:05:42,676 --> 00:05:43,594
FINE BY ME.

127
00:05:49,766 --> 00:05:50,601
SPINNER:
JIMMY.

128
00:05:50,684 --> 00:05:52,811
NEXT TIME,
REGULAR SPRAY CHEESE -

129
00:05:52,895 --> 00:05:54,605
NOT 5-ALARM JALAPENO.

130
00:05:56,899 --> 00:05:59,151
UH, DUDE, YOU TOOK MY SPOT.

131
00:06:00,736 --> 00:06:03,071
MARCO:
UH, SPIN, THE MIDDLE CUSHION
DOESN'T HAVE TEETH, BUD.

132
00:06:03,155 --> 00:06:04,823
IT'S NOT GONNA BITE.

133
00:06:05,782 --> 00:06:06,950
SPINNER:
YEAH.

134
00:06:09,786 --> 00:06:11,788
MARCO:
OKAY, SO WHERE WERE WE?

135
00:06:11,872 --> 00:06:13,457
POLYNOMIALS, RIGHT?

136
00:06:14,208 --> 00:06:15,834
JIMMY:
YOU GUYS MIND
IF I PUT ON THE TUBE?

137
00:06:15,918 --> 00:06:18,629
I LIKE A LITTLE BACKGROUND
NOISE.

138
00:06:23,634 --> 00:06:26,011
AH, THE WONDERS OF SATELLITE.

139
00:06:26,803 --> 00:06:27,221
WHOA!

140
00:06:28,222 --> 00:06:33,143
DIDN'T KNOW YOU COULD FIT THAT
MANY PEOPLE ON A POOL TABLE.

141
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:38,899
HEY!

142
00:06:38,982 --> 00:06:40,317
NO, SPIN.

143
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,569
NOT EVERYONE HERE WANTS
TO WATCH THAT.

144
00:06:42,653 --> 00:06:44,738
KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?

145
00:06:44,821 --> 00:06:45,864
MARCO:
NO, NO.

146
00:06:45,948 --> 00:06:49,993
SEEING NAKED LADIES
DOESN'T BURN MY EYES OUT, NO.

147
00:06:53,789 --> 00:06:57,125
BESIDES, I WASN'T LOOKING
AT THEM.

148
00:06:59,628 --> 00:07:02,005
THEN WHAT WERE YOU LOOKING AT?

149
00:07:02,089 --> 00:07:04,508
THE DRAPES.
SPIN, THE DRAPES.

150
00:07:06,009 --> 00:07:08,720
HE WAS LOOKING AT THE DUDES,
YOU IDIOT.

151
00:07:08,804 --> 00:07:09,137
UGH.

152
00:07:11,181 --> 00:07:12,975
OKAY, CAN WE
GET BACK TO WORK?

153
00:07:13,058 --> 00:07:15,727
I KIND OF CARE ABOUT
MY STUDIES.

154
00:07:17,563 --> 00:07:32,786
♪♪♪

155
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:34,955
OKAY, ONE MORE THING...

156
00:07:35,038 --> 00:07:37,249
NO TALKING ABOUT
THE ENVIRONMENT.

157
00:07:37,332 --> 00:07:39,084
THE ENVIRONMENT
IS NOT SEXY.

158
00:07:39,168 --> 00:07:40,836
DO NOT TALK ABOUT IT.

159
00:07:40,919 --> 00:07:42,212
OKAY, I GOT IT.

160
00:07:43,839 --> 00:07:46,550
MANNY:
HE'S HERE
AND HE'S WATCHING YOU.

161
00:07:46,633 --> 00:07:48,385
GO! DON'T BE CHICKEN.

162
00:08:08,238 --> 00:08:09,239
JOEY:
CRAIG.

163
00:08:10,741 --> 00:08:11,825
HELLO? CRAIG MANNING?

164
00:08:11,909 --> 00:08:13,243
HM? SORRY?

165
00:08:14,328 --> 00:08:16,914
SYDNEY:
IF THIS MOVIE IS BORING YOU,
WE CAN CHANGE IT.

166
00:08:16,997 --> 00:08:18,582
NAH, NO, IT'S FINE.

167
00:08:19,124 --> 00:08:20,792
IT'S FINE. IT'S GOOD.

168
00:08:20,876 --> 00:08:23,003
HEY LOOK, CRAIG I'M NOT TRYING
TO BE NOSEY OR ANYTHING,

169
00:08:23,086 --> 00:08:25,506
AND BOY, WE SURE DO ENJOY
YOUR COMPANY,

170
00:08:25,589 --> 00:08:29,676
BUT WHAT ARE YOU DOING HOME
ON A FRIDAY NIGHT?

171
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:30,802
I DON'T KNOW.

172
00:08:32,387 --> 00:08:36,099
MAYBE I SHOULD,
MAYBE I SHOULD GO TO JIMMY'S.

173
00:08:36,975 --> 00:08:38,602
IF YOU WANT.

174
00:08:38,685 --> 00:08:40,270
OKAY, OKAY.
JIMMY'S.

175
00:08:42,272 --> 00:08:43,857
I'LL SEE YOU LATER.

176
00:08:48,946 --> 00:08:52,658
AND NOW WE HAVE THE PLACE
TO OURSELVES.

177
00:08:55,494 --> 00:08:57,788
OKAY,
SO X IS THE VARIABLE?

178
00:08:59,122 --> 00:09:01,792
FOR THE TENTH TIME,

OKAY, THAT'S TOTALLY EVIL.

IT MAY BE EVIL
BUT IT'S EFFECTIVE.

HE JUST WANTED TO WRAP
HIS HANDS AROUND ME.

260
00:13:39,486 --> 00:13:42,072
LOOK, SERIOUSLY,

FOR WHAT?

268
00:14:22,112 --> 00:14:24,781
FOR UNPLUGGING
THE SOUND SYSTEM.

269
00:14:25,699 --> 00:14:27,951
GETTING YOU IN TROUBLE
WITH MELANDA.

270

MANNY:
IT'S OKAY.

287
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:12,139
I CAN KEEP A SECRET.

288
00:16:43,504 --> 00:16:44,671
I CAN'T.

289
00:16:47,174 --> 00:16:50,010

00:17:23,001 --> 00:17:23,752
SPINNER:
I KNEW IT!

293
00:17:23,836 --> 00:17:25,879
I KNEW YOU

I WAS TRYING TO SAVE YOU
FROM CHOKING.

303
00:17:42,229 --> 00:17:44,565

I MEAN, YOUR HAIR?
IT'S SO LAST YEAR, BUDDY.

JUST BECAUSE YOU'RE
A GUY,

329
00:20:04,246 --> 00:20:07,249
IT DOESN'T AUTOMATICALLY MEAN
I'M ATTRACTED TO YOU.

330
00:20:07,332 --> 00:20:10,294
I MEAN, DO YOU LIKE
EVERY GIRL THAT COMES ALONG?

331
00:20:10,377 --> 00:20:12,129
IF THEY'RE HOT.

332
00:20:12,671 --> 00:20:14,631
WELL, YOU'RE NOT.

I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT
YOU'RE UPSET ABOUT THIS.

337
00:20:29,688 --> 00:20:31,273
DUDE, I'M NOT UPSET.

338
00:20:31,356 --> 00:20:35,110
COME ON, IT'S JUST REALLY
OBVIOUS YOU HAVE BAD TASTE.

339
00:20:35,194 --> 00:20:38,530

IF CRAIG REALLY
LOVES HER...

347
00:20:59,718 --> 00:21:01,136
THEN WHY DOES HE KEEP
COMING BACK TO ME?

348
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:03,430
KEEP COMING BACK-

349
00:21:03,514 --> 00:21:04,932
MANNY, DON'T TELL ME.

350
00:21:05,015 --> 00:21:06,308
YOU KNOW, YOU KNEW CHRIS
HAD A GIRLFRIEND.

351
00:21:06,391 --> 00:21:07,726
WHICH IS WHY I CAME HOME.

352
00:21:07,809 --> 00:21:08,519
I THINK YOU CHICKENED OUT.

353
00:21:08,602 --> 00:21:09,728
I MADE THE RIGHT CHOICE

354
00:21:09,811 --> 00:21:11,855
AND IT'S SOMETHING YOU
SHOULD THINK ABOUT.

355
00:21:11,939 --> 00:21:13,607
YOU WANT ME TO MAKE A CHOICE?

356
00:21:13,690 --> 00:21:17,361
FINE. I CHOOSE TO STOP HANGING
OUT WITH YOU.

357
00:21:20,030 --> 00:21:21,990
YOU DON'T WANT TO BE FRIENDS?

358
00:21:22,074 --> 00:21:25,077
NOT WITH A STUCK-UP,
PRUDE PRINCESS.

359
00:21:27,246 --> 00:21:27,913
GOOD.

360
00:21:27,996 --> 00:21:32,584
'CAUSE I DON'T WANT TO BE
FRIENDS WITH THE SCHOOL SLUT.
