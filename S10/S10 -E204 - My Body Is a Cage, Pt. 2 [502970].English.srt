I DON'T ASK FOR MUCH.

179
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:52,639
I JUST WANTED TO HAVE
A NICE FAMILY DINNER.

180
00:07:52,723 --> 00:07:54,433
THAT'S ALL.

181
00:07:54,516 --> 00:07:55,517

182
00:08:01,523 --> 00:08:04,234
SO WHERE DID YOU GET
THOSE BOXER SHORTS?

183
00:08:04,318 --> 00:08:05,736
MY COUSIN KNOWS
A GUY.

184
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:07,571
IT WAS WEIRD HOW MS. OH
WAS ALL CALM.

185
00:08:07,654 --> 00:08:08,989
LIKE SHE WAS SAD
OR SOMETHING.

186
00:08:09,072 --> 00:08:10,490
YEAH, SHE'S PROBABLY
RIDING ON THE HOG

187
00:08:10,574 --> 00:08:11,742

188
00:08:11,825 --> 00:08:12,826

190
00:08:16,747 --> 00:08:19,041
SHE IS HUMAN!
SOMETHING MUST BE UP.

191
00:08:20,042 --> 00:08:22,586
SHE CHANGED HER PROFILE

193
00:08:24,421 --> 00:08:25,422

196
00:08:30,177 --> 00:08:31,386
SHE'S GOT A BROKEN HEART.

197
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:42,231
I JUST WANNA PASS.

198
00:08:42,314 --> 00:08:43,857

00:09:02,125 --> 00:09:03,335
WHAT'S UP, HONEY?

207
00:09:03,418 --> 00:09:05,796
UM... WHEN YOU GO
THROUGH TREATMENT,

208
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:08,173
ARE YOU GONNA LOSE
ALL YOUR HAIR?

209
00:09:08,257 --> 00:09:10,133
MM, NO,
NOT WITH RADIATION.

210
00:09:10,217 --> 00:09:11,218
GOOD.

211
00:09:14,012 --> 00:09:16,348
BUT IT STILL MIGHT BE SCARY.

212
00:09:16,431 --> 00:09:20,018
I'LL BE TIRED;
PROBABLY FEEL SICK.

213
00:09:20,102 --> 00:09:21,979
BUT SHE'S GONNA BE OKAY,
RIGHT?

214
00:09:22,062 --> 00:09:24,273

216
00:09:26,233 --> 00:09:28,902
I'D REALLY LIKE YOU TO BE AT
THE DOCTOR'S MEETING TOMORROW.

217
00:09:31,655 --> 00:09:33,282
TELL YOU WHAT.
AFTER DINNER,

218
00:09:33,365 --> 00:09:34,867
WHY DON'T WE GIVE
EACH OTHER MANICURES.

219
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:36,994
I CAN'T LET THE CUTE DOCTOR
SEE ME WITH NAILS LIKE THIS.

220
00:09:37,077 --> 00:09:39,246
LOOK AT THAT!

221
00:09:39,329 --> 00:09:40,873
HAROLD:
LET'S HOPE HE'S MORE FOCUSED
ON YOUR HEALTH

222
00:09:40,956 --> 00:09:41,874
THAN YOUR NAILS.

223
00:09:41,957 --> 00:09:44,960
AWWW!
DON'T BE JEALOUS, HONEY!

224
00:09:45,043 --> 00:09:46,420
WHATEVER!

225
00:09:46,503 --> 00:09:48,630
HOW CAN YOU GUYS BE LAUGHING

227
00:09:49,715 --> 00:09:51,675
NO, I MEAN, YOU JUST SAID
THAT SHE MIGHT NOT BE OKAY,

228
00:09:51,758 --> 00:09:52,885
AND YOU'RE ARE ACTING
LIKE NOTHING'S WRONG.

229
00:09:52,968 --> 00:09:54,970

OF COURSE, BUMBLE BEE,

231
00:09:57,264 --> 00:09:59,850
BUT WE CAN'T STOP LIVING.

232
00:10:02,394 --> 00:10:03,937
OKAY, I CAN'T DEAL
WITH YOU GUYS, RIGHT NOW.

233
00:10:04,021 --> 00:10:04,938
