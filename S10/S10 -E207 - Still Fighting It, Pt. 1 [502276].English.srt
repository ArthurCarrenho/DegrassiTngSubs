UH, WHEN ROMEO FINDS JULIET
PRETENDING TO BE DEAD,

185
00:07:13,725 --> 00:07:15,143
HE CAN'T WAIT TO START
HIS NEW LIFE WITH HER.

186
00:07:15,227 --> 00:07:16,478
AND WHEN IT LOOKS LIKE
SHE'S REALLY DEAD,

187
00:07:16,562 --> 00:07:18,564
HE CAN'T GO ON ANY MORE,
SO HE DRINKS THE POISON.

188
00:07:18,647 --> 00:07:20,023

FINDS ROMEO DEAD,

190
00:07:21,233 --> 00:07:23,110

WOULD REQUIRE A FEW MINUTES

JULIET WERE TO WAKE UP,

197
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:40,502
AND FIND HIM ALIVE
FOR A BRIEF MOMENT?

198
00:07:40,586 --> 00:07:42,462
THEY COULD SHARE
A FINAL KISS.

417

AND TO PROTECT HIM,

418
00:17:04,316 --> 00:17:06,944

"I'M SPARTACUS!"
