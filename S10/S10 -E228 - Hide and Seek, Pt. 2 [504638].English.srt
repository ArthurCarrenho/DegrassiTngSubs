IF IT'S NOT DANGEROUS,

179
00:07:42,838 --> 00:07:44,089
IT'S NOT WORTH IT,
RIGHT?

YOU'RE RIGHT,

183
00:07:56,977 --> 00:07:59,646
I'LL NEVER BE ABLE
TO MAKE IT ON MY OWN.

184
00:07:59,730 --> 00:08:01,815
THANK YOU FOR LETTING ME
COME BACK.

185
00:08:01,899 --> 00:08:03,317
SO WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?

186
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:05,319
MAYBE I CAN JUST STAY HERE
A COUPLE MORE DAYS,

187
00:08:05,402 --> 00:08:08,405
JUST UNTIL I FIGURE
EVERYTHING OUT.

188
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:11,158
SAV:
I HAVE A BETTER IDEA.

189
00:08:14,661 --> 00:08:15,829
YOU COULD COME HOME.

190
00:08:15,913 --> 00:08:17,581
YOU PROMISED
YOU WOULDN'T CALL HIM!

191
00:08:17,664 --> 00:08:18,582
I COULDN'T
JUST LET YOU GO.

192
00:08:18,665 --> 00:08:19,583
YES. YOU COULD.

193
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:21,460
NOW HE'S JUST GONNA DRAG ME
BACK HOME TO MY PARENTS!

194
00:08:21,543 --> 00:08:23,420
I WON'T.

195
00:08:23,504 --> 00:08:25,506

TO LET ME COME ALONE.

196
00:08:25,589 --> 00:08:27,090
I JUST WANNA TALK.

197
00:08:28,091 --> 00:08:29,301
ARE YOU MAD AT ME?

198
00:08:29,384 --> 00:08:31,094
SAV:
YEAH, I WAS.

199
00:08:31,178 --> 00:08:33,972
BUT I'M REALLY GLAD
YOU'RE OKAY.

200
00:08:34,056 --> 00:08:35,933
MOM AND DAD FEEL
THE SAME WAY?

201
00:08:36,016 --> 00:08:37,100
YOU KNOW THEM...

202
00:08:37,184 --> 00:08:39,603
EXACTLY. IF I COME HOME,
THEY'LL JUST YELL.

203
00:08:39,686 --> 00:08:40,896
IT'S LIKE THEY'VE
GIVEN UP ON ME.

204
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:42,105
YEAH, I GET IT.

205
00:08:44,441 --> 00:08:45,442
YOU DO?

206
00:08:46,568 --> 00:08:49,363
YEAH. I WON'T FORCE YOU
TO COME HOME.

207
00:08:49,446 --> 00:08:50,781
BUT IF YOU DO,

208
00:08:50,864 --> 00:08:51,865
I'VE GOT YOUR BACK.

209
00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:54,826
IT'LL BE DIFFERENT THIS TIME,
I PROMISE.

210
00:09:05,796 --> 00:09:07,923
AND ALLI,

211
00:09:08,006 --> 00:09:10,551
IF YOU DECIDE TO GO
SOMEWHERE ELSE,

212
00:09:10,634 --> 00:09:13,303
PLEASE JUST TELL ME WHERE.

A SORE THROAT?

220
00:09:43,417 --> 00:09:46,587
A LITTLE, BUT...
I MEAN, I'M FINE.

221
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:48,505
DID SOMEONE CALL
YOUR PARENTS?

222
00:09:48,589 --> 00:09:50,257
I'M EIGHTEEN.

223
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:51,592

224
00:09:51,675 --> 00:09:53,177
IT'S NO BIG DEAL.

225
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:54,845
CAN I GO? I HAVE A REALLY
IMPORTANT PRESENTATION.

226
00:09:54,928 --> 00:09:57,431
I REALLY DON'T
ADVISE THAT.

227

I'M SORRY.

DANGEROUS RESULTS.

231

232
00:10:08,358 --> 00:10:10,277

00:16:03,505 --> 00:16:06,842
I THINK WE ALL NEED
A BLANK SLATE.

353
00:16:09,511 --> 00:16:11,763
ALLI:
SO... HOW DO WE DO THAT?

354
00:16:11,847 --> 00:16:14,600
MR. BHANDARI:
YOUR MOTHER AND I WILL
TRY TO UNDERSTAND

355
00:16:14,683 --> 00:16:18,353
THE PRESSURES YOU FACE
AS A TEENAGE GIRL TODAY.

356
00:16:18,437 --> 00:16:21,273
AND I WANT
TO CHANGE TOO.

357
00:16:21,356 --> 00:16:23,775
MAYBE WE CAN TALK
TO SOMEONE?

358
00:16:23,859 --> 00:16:25,360
LIKE A THERAPIST?

359
00:16:25,444 --> 00:16:28,989
YEAH, SOMEONE NEUTRAL.
THAT'S, THAT'S A GOOD IDEA.

360
00:16:29,072 --> 00:16:31,575
A STRANGER IN
OUR FAMILY BUSINESS?

361
00:16:38,248 --> 00:16:39,583
PERHAPS...

362
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:45,047
IT CAN HELP US.

363
00:16:45,130 --> 00:16:47,883
TO TALK TO
EACH OTHER MORE.

364
00:16:52,262 --> 00:16:54,139
ALLI...

365
00:16:54,223 --> 00:16:56,808
WE'RE JUST...
WE'RE SO GLAD YOU'RE HOME.

366
00:17:03,649 --> 00:17:05,150

(SCHOOL BELL RINGS)

368
00:17:27,548 --> 00:17:29,091
HEY! UP TOP!

369
00:17:30,092 --> 00:17:32,094
I CAN'T.
IT'S SPRAINED.

370
00:17:32,177 --> 00:17:33,011
ALL RIGHT. WELL, WHEN ARE YOU
GONNA GET BACK UP

371
00:17:33,095 --> 00:17:34,179
ON THE POGO STICK.

372
00:17:34,263 --> 00:17:36,515
(SCOFFS) HALF PAST NEVER.
ARE YOU CRAZY?

373
00:17:36,598 --> 00:17:37,516
BUT YOU WERE BEATING
THE RECORD.

374
00:17:37,599 --> 00:17:38,517
I GUESS,

375
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,435
BUT I'LL BE SIXTEEN
IN A COUPLE DAYS.

376
00:17:40,519 --> 00:17:41,603
IT'S TOO LATE.

377
00:17:41,687 --> 00:17:43,522
NO CAR, NO GIRL,
NO RECORD.

378
00:17:43,605 --> 00:17:45,941
I LET MY 11-YEAR-OLD SELF
DOWN.

379
00:17:49,111 --> 00:17:50,112
HI, WESLEY.

380
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:52,781
HANNAH!

381
00:17:54,491 --> 00:17:56,118
I CAN'T BELIEVE I TRIED
TO SHOW OFF.

382
00:17:56,201 --> 00:17:57,119
I'M SO DUMB.

383
00:17:57,202 --> 00:17:58,579
NAH, IT WAS AWESOME!

384
00:17:58,662 --> 00:18:00,831
WE BOTH KNEW THAT
MODIFICATION WAS RISKY.

385
00:18:00,914 --> 00:18:02,791
I HAVE THE WRIST BRACE
TO PROVE IT.

386
00:18:02,875 --> 00:18:05,335
I KNOW.
IT'S A BUMMER.

387
00:18:05,419 --> 00:18:06,879
REALLY? WHY?

388
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:09,464
KINDA HOPED THAT
AFTER YOU BEAT THE RECORD,

389
00:18:09,548 --> 00:18:11,425
WE COULD CELEBRATE...

390
00:18:11,508 --> 00:18:13,802
AND MAYBE HOLD HANDS.

391
00:18:15,304 --> 00:18:17,014

BRO. BRO.

392
00:18:18,223 --> 00:18:19,224
DO IT!

394
00:18:21,810 --> 00:18:23,645
GO ON A DATE TYPE THING
SOMETIME?

395
00:18:23,729 --> 00:18:25,105
I'D LOVE TO.

396
00:18:25,189 --> 00:18:26,815
LET ME KNOW WHEN.

397
00:18:26,899 --> 00:18:27,900
OKAY.

398

401
00:18:45,167 --> 00:18:46,543
WE'VE GOT SOME
CONCLUSIVE RESULTS.

402
00:18:46,627 --> 00:18:47,544
OH, GOOD.

403
00:18:47,628 --> 00:18:49,087
DOCTOR:
IT LOOKS LIKE YOUR RENAL SYSTEM
WAS COMPROMISED

404
00:18:49,171 --> 00:18:50,839
BY A STREPTOCOCCAL
INFECTION,

405
00:18:50,923 --> 00:18:53,759
WHICH MAY HAVE RESULTED
IN GLOMEROLUNEPHRITIS.

406
00:18:53,842 --> 00:18:55,052
I'M SORRY, WHAT?

407
00:18:55,135 --> 00:18:57,429
DID YOU SUSPECT
YOU HAD STREP THROAT?

408
00:18:57,513 --> 00:18:58,764
WERE YOU RUNNING A FEVER?

409
00:18:58,847 --> 00:19:01,975
MAYBE. I'VE BEEN RUNNING
AROUND A LOT.

410
00:19:02,059 --> 00:19:03,519
IF INFECTIONS LIKE THIS
GO UNTREATED,

411
00:19:03,602 --> 00:19:06,230
THEY CAN AFFECT YOU
IN UNEXPECTED WAYS.

412
00:19:06,313 --> 00:19:07,898
IN YOUR CASE,
YOUR KIDNEYS WERE COMPROMISED,

413
00:19:07,981 --> 00:19:10,984
WHICH IS WHAT CAUSED
YOUR URGE INCONTINENCE TODAY.

414
00:19:11,068 --> 00:19:13,695
YOU MEAN,
THAT'S WHY I WET MYSELF.

415
00:19:13,779 --> 00:19:15,239
SYMPTOMS HAVE TO BE
TREATED IMMEDIATELY

416
00:19:15,322 --> 00:19:17,533
TO AVOID COMPLICATIONS
LIKE THIS.

417
00:19:17,616 --> 00:19:19,910
OH, CAN SHE TAKE SOME
ANTIBIOTICS?

418
00:19:19,993 --> 00:19:23,956
YES, BUT WE ALSO NEED
TO RUN A COURSE OF DIALYSIS.

419
00:19:24,039 --> 00:19:26,458
WHAT? FOR HOW LONG?

420
00:19:26,542 --> 00:19:28,001
WELL, IT'S TOUGH TO SAY.

421
00:19:28,085 --> 00:19:30,379
UNTIL THE DIALYSIS GETS
EVERYTHING UNDER CONTROL.

422
00:19:30,462 --> 00:19:32,840
WAIT. AM I...
IS THIS SERIOUS?

423
00:19:33,841 --> 00:19:34,758
WE REALLY DON'T KNOW

424
00:19:34,842 --> 00:19:36,134
HOW YOU'RE GOING TO RESPOND
TO TREATMENT,

425
00:19:36,218 --> 00:19:37,970
BUT IT IS IMPORTANT
WE START TODAY.

426
00:19:38,053 --> 00:19:40,639

OKAY. WELL, DO YOU THINK
I LOOK OKAY FOR WHATEVER?

I THINK YOU LOOK PERFECT...

ARE YOU SERIOUS?

00:20:35,152 --> 00:20:36,653
I NEED DRIVEN, DETERMINED,
