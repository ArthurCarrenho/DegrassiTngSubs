00:20:21,346 --> 00:20:24,141
MIGHT BE TIME
I GAVE IT A TRY.

533
00:20:24,224 --> 00:20:26,560
WELL, IT ALSO LOOKS GOOD
ON A RESUME,

534
00:20:26,643 --> 00:20:28,478
ESPECIALLY IF THE IVY LEAGUE
IS IN MY FUTURE.

535
00:20:28,562 --> 00:20:30,606
YOU'RE NOT THE ONLY ONE
WITH A FUTURE.

536
00:20:30,689 --> 00:20:32,107
YOU'RE RIGHT.

537
00:20:32,191 --> 00:20:34,151
IT'S JUST THAT MY FUTURE
DOESN'T INVOLVE...

538
00:20:34,234 --> 00:20:35,194
TEEN FATHERHOOD.

539
00:20:35,277 --> 00:20:38,030
WELL YEAH,
THAT WOULD JUST BE WEIRD.

540
00:20:38,113 --> 00:20:39,531
WAIT. WHAT?

541
00:20:39,615 --> 00:20:40,991
I KNOW, SAV.

542
00:20:41,074 --> 00:20:42,784
ANYA TOLD ME.

543
00:20:42,868 --> 00:20:44,077
TOLD YOU...?

544
00:20:44,161 --> 00:20:45,829
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE A LOT
ON YOUR PLATE NEXT YEAR

545
00:20:45,913 --> 00:20:47,206
BEING STUDENT COUNCIL
PRESIDENT,

546
00:20:47,289 --> 00:20:49,082
AND A DAD.

547
00:20:49,166 --> 00:20:51,460
WHO SAID ANYTHING
ABOUT BEING A DAD?

548
00:20:51,543 --> 00:20:54,087
YOU DON'T HAVE TO PRETEND
ANY MORE, SWEETIE.

549
00:20:54,171 --> 00:20:56,757
ANYA TOLD ME SHE'S...

550
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:58,091
PREGNANT.

551
00:21:07,768 --> 00:21:08,769
LARA:
READY, HONEY?

552
00:21:08,852 --> 00:21:12,439
THE GUESTS ARE STARTING
TO ARRIVE FOR BRUNCH.

553
00:21:12,523 --> 00:21:15,359

554
00:21:15,442 --> 00:21:18,612
