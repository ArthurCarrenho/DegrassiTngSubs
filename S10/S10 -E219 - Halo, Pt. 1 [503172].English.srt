534
00:21:11,021 --> 00:21:12,272
WHAT?
HOLLY J: YEAH.

535
00:21:12,356 --> 00:21:13,857
YOU AND SAV?
HOLLY J: UH-HUH.

536
00:21:13,941 --> 00:21:14,858
YEAH, KIND OF.

537
00:21:14,942 --> 00:21:17,277
WELL, I-I'M SORRY, HOLLY J,
BUT...

538
00:21:17,361 --> 00:21:18,403
HE'S INTO ME.

539
00:21:20,364 --> 00:21:21,490
(ASTONISHED LAUGH)

540
00:21:21,573 --> 00:21:23,617
OKAY, JUST IN CASE
YOU HAVEN'T...

541
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:25,410
YOU KNOW,
LOOKED DOWN RECENTLY,

542
00:21:25,494 --> 00:21:27,287
YOU'RE WITH CHILD!

543
00:21:27,371 --> 00:21:28,872
I DON'T THINK
IT MATTERS.

544
00:21:28,956 --> 00:21:30,457
WELL, I THINK
YOUR PRENATAL VITAMINS

545
00:21:30,541 --> 00:21:32,167
ARE GETTING TO YOUR HEAD.

546
00:21:32,251 --> 00:21:34,336
OBVIOUSLY, YOU DON'T KNOW ME
VERY WELL.

547
00:21:34,419 --> 00:21:37,214
GETTING RID OF INSIGNIFICANT
TEMPORARY GIRLFRIENDS

548
00:21:37,297 --> 00:21:38,715
IS KINDA MY THING.

549
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:41,760
HONEY, SAVE YOURSELF
THE EMBARRASSMENT.

550
00:21:41,844 --> 00:21:43,804
SAV WILL NEVER
GO FOR YOU.

551
00:21:43,887 --> 00:21:46,014
NOT IN A MILLION YEARS.

552
00:21:47,015 --> 00:21:48,016
WATCH.
