IT'S GREAT GRUB,

3
00:00:06,590 --> 00:00:08,759
AND IT'S WALKING DISTANCE.

4
00:00:13,514 --> 00:00:15,432
AND WE HAVE ADAM.

5
00:00:15,516 --> 00:00:16,642
SORRY, I'M LATE.

6
00:00:16,725 --> 00:00:18,519
ANY CHANCE YOU BROUGHT
YOUR LEADING LADY?

7
00:00:18,602 --> 00:00:20,312
UH, FIONA PROBABLY
SLEPT IN.

8
00:00:20,395 --> 00:00:21,480
WE WERE UP LATE.

9
00:00:21,563 --> 00:00:22,773
REHEARSING?

10
00:00:22,856 --> 00:00:25,901
IF THAT'S WHAT THE KIDS
ARE CALLING IT.

11
00:00:25,984 --> 00:00:27,361
OFFICIALLY,

12
00:00:27,444 --> 00:00:29,738
I DON'T SUPPORT THIS
DIVA-LIKE BEHAVIOUR.

13
00:00:29,821 --> 00:00:31,323
UNOFFICIALLY...

14
00:00:31,406 --> 00:00:32,866
UP HERE!

15
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:33,659
YOU WERE RIGHT,
DUDE.

16
00:00:33,742 --> 00:00:35,369
FIONA'S TOTALLY INTO ME.

17
00:00:35,452 --> 00:00:37,788
NO CHAMPAGNE REQUIRED.

18
00:00:39,373 --> 00:00:40,541
SHE'S DRINKING AGAIN?

19
00:00:40,624 --> 00:00:43,961
SHE LIKES CHAMPAGNE AND ME -
SEPARATELY.

20
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:45,671
IF YOU SPENT TIME
WITH US, YOU'D SEE THAT.

21
00:00:45,754 --> 00:00:48,715
WELL, THEN LET'S SPEND
TIME WITH YOU.

22
00:00:48,799 --> 00:00:50,634
I'M DRAGGING ELI

26
00:00:55,764 --> 00:00:57,641
UNLESS YOU HAVE
OTHER PLANS?

27
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:59,643
NO, NO,
THAT SHOULD BE FINE.

28
00:00:59,726 --> 00:01:00,727

JUST TEXTING HOLLY J.

00:02:01,914 --> 00:02:04,333
THE SWEETEST!
LIKE AMAZING!

50
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:08,128
SO WHEN DO I GET TO MEET
MY FUTURE SON-IN-LAW?

51
00:02:08,212 --> 00:02:09,922
IT'S DR. CHRIS.

52
00:02:10,923 --> 00:02:13,008
MY WAY-TOO-OLD-FOR-YOU-
CANCER DOCTOR?

53
00:02:13,091 --> 00:02:14,468
HE'S ONLY TWENTY-FIVE.

54
00:02:14,551 --> 00:02:16,220
THAT'S EIGHT YEARS OLDER
THAN YOU ARE.

55
00:02:16,303 --> 00:02:18,597
HONEY, NOTHING IS GOING
TO HAPPEN.

56
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,557
THEN WHY DID WE GO
ON A DATE?!

57
00:02:20,641 --> 00:02:21,975
WHEN?!
LAST NIGHT.

58
00:02:22,059 --> 00:02:23,477
AND I THINK WE'RE GONNA
DO IT AGAIN.

59
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,312
OH, NO YOU'RE NOT.

60
00:02:26,313 --> 00:02:27,105
MOM, I'M SEVENTEEN.

61
00:02:27,189 --> 00:02:29,066
YOU CAN'T TELL ME
WHAT TO DO.

62
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:30,692
ANYA MARIE MACPHERSON,

63
00:02:30,776 --> 00:02:33,403
WE ARE NOT FINISHED
WITH THIS DISCUSSION.

64
00:02:33,487 --> 00:02:34,863
ARE YOU GONNA CHANGE
YOUR MIND?

65
00:02:34,947 --> 00:02:35,989
(BELL RINGS)

66
00:02:36,073 --> 00:02:38,075
THEN WE ARE.

67
00:02:45,207 --> 00:02:46,416
WOW.

68
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,961
SO ARE YOU AND ADAM
A THING?

69
00:02:49,044 --> 00:02:50,003
A THING?

70
00:02:50,087 --> 00:02:51,713
YOU KNOW, A COUPLE.

71
00:02:52,714 --> 00:02:54,216
I DON'T KNOW.

72
00:02:54,299 --> 00:02:56,593
BUT YOU LIKE HIM?

73
00:02:56,677 --> 00:02:57,886
I DON'T KNOW.

74
00:02:57,970 --> 00:02:59,263
THEN WHY WERE YOU
MAKING OUT?

75
00:02:59,346 --> 00:03:00,264
I DON'T KNOW,
HOLLY J.

76
00:03:00,347 --> 00:03:02,099
CAN WE STOP WITH
THE INTERROGATION?!

77
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:03,517
OKAY, OKAY...

78
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:07,980
I'VE JUST NEVER SEEN YOU WITH
SOMEONE LIKE THAT BEFORE.

79
00:03:08,063 --> 00:03:10,232
I FEEL COMFORTABLE
AROUND HIM.

80
00:03:10,315 --> 00:03:11,316
SAFE.

81
00:03:12,359 --> 00:03:14,236
HE LIKES ME
THE WAY I AM.

82
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:16,864
THOSE ARE ALL
REALLY GOOD THINGS.

83
00:03:16,947 --> 00:03:20,742
SO WHY THROW DRINKING
INTO THE MIX?

84
00:03:20,826 --> 00:03:22,995
DID I TELL YOU
ADAM SENT ME ROSES?

85
00:03:23,078 --> 00:03:24,371
WHITE.

86
00:03:24,454 --> 00:03:25,455
MY FAVOURITE.

87
00:03:25,539 --> 00:03:26,540
FIONA...

88
00:03:26,623 --> 00:03:28,625
DRINKING MAKES ME
FEEL GOOD, HOLLY J.

89
00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:30,669
WHY WOULD I STOP?

90
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:34,798
(SCOFFS)

91
00:03:38,635 --> 00:03:41,138
SADIE:
HEY. LET ME GET THAT
FOR YOU.

92
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:44,558
THANKS.

93
00:03:44,641 --> 00:03:46,351
SO WE STILL ON
FOR BASKETBALL LATER?

94
00:03:46,435 --> 00:03:47,561
UH, I WAS THINKING
WE COULD DO

95
00:03:47,644 --> 00:03:49,229
SOMETHING A LITTLE BIT
MORE SEDENTARY,

96
00:03:49,313 --> 00:03:51,648
LIKE A, LIKE A MOVIE?

97
00:03:51,732 --> 00:03:52,858
ARE YOU AFRAID TO PLAY
A GIRL?

98
00:03:52,941 --> 00:03:55,235
YEAH.
SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

99
00:03:55,319 --> 00:03:58,572
LOOK, I'LL, UH, TALL YOU.
UH, CALL YOU.

100
00:03:58,655 --> 00:04:00,073
CALL YOU LATER.

101
00:04:04,203 --> 00:04:06,538
SO, I HEARD WIZARD OF OZ
IS PLAYING AT THE REP.

102
00:04:06,622 --> 00:04:08,207
BET SADIE LOVES
MUNCHKINS.

103
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:08,957
BETTER BUY HER DINNER FIRST.

104
00:04:09,041 --> 00:04:11,001
YOU DON'T WANT HER
TO FEEL... SHORT CHANGED.

105
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:12,085
(LAUGHING)

106
00:04:12,169 --> 00:04:14,296
YEAH, WELL,
AT LEAST I'M NOT A GEEK.

107
00:04:14,379 --> 00:04:14,922
CONNOR:
GOOD ONE, DAVE.

108
00:04:15,005 --> 00:04:17,508
YEAH, YOU'RE DEFINITELY
NOT SHORT ON MATERIAL.

109
00:04:17,591 --> 00:04:18,759
(LAUGHING HYSTERICALLY)

110
00:04:18,842 --> 00:04:20,719
OVER HERE.

111
00:04:20,802 --> 00:04:22,804
ANYA:
MY MOM IS BEING
SO UNREASONABLE.

112
00:04:22,888 --> 00:04:24,056
EVERYONE KNOWS THE RULES
FOR DATING

113
00:04:24,139 --> 00:04:25,557
IS HALF YOUR AGE
PLUS SEVEN.

114
00:04:25,641 --> 00:04:27,684
SO HALF OF TWENTY-FIVE,
PLUS SEVEN...

115
00:04:27,768 --> 00:04:30,771
HOLLY J:
IS NINETEEN AND A HALF.
AND YOU ARE...

116
00:04:30,854 --> 00:04:32,356
ANYA:
ALMOST EIGHTEEN.

117
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:33,857
BUT WHO NEEDS STUPID RULES

118
00:04:33,941 --> 00:04:35,817
WHEN YOU HAVE A CONNECTION
LIKE WE DO?

119
00:04:35,901 --> 00:04:36,985
WELL, YOU HAVE TO TELL HIM
THE TRUTH.

120
00:04:37,069 --> 00:04:38,737
I'M GOING TO.

121
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:41,323
HOLLY J:
AFTER YOU'RE HAPPILY MARRIED
AND HAVE TWO CHILDREN?

122
00:04:41,406 --> 00:04:43,367
(SIGHS) OR THREE.

123
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:45,118
I'M STILL HAVEN'T
DECIDED YET.

124
00:04:45,202 --> 00:04:46,912
HOLLY J:
WHAT IF HE WANTS TO GO
TO A BAR?

125
00:04:46,995 --> 00:04:48,539
I'LL GET A FAKE ID.

126
00:04:48,622 --> 00:04:49,957
HOLLY J:
OR RENT A CAR?

127
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,166
I DON'T DRIVE.

128
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:52,501
OR TAKES YOU TO
A WORK EVENT

129
00:04:52,584 --> 00:04:54,044
WHERE YOU BUMP INTO ONE
OF YOUR PARENTS' FRIENDS

130
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:56,004
AND THEY KNOW
HOW OLD YOU ARE?

131
00:04:56,088 --> 00:04:57,756
(BLOWS) I'D...

132
00:04:59,842 --> 00:05:01,510
DO YOU THINK HE'D GET
IN TROUBLE?

133
00:05:01,593 --> 00:05:03,387
MAYBE.

134
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:04,346
THE LONGER YOU WAIT
TO TELL HIM,

135
00:05:04,429 --> 00:05:06,223
THE HARDER IT'S GONNA BE.

136
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:07,474
WE'RE HAVING LUNCH
AT HIS OFFICE.

137
00:05:07,558 --> 00:05:09,017
SEE? SOUNDS LIKE
THE PERFECT OPPORTUNITY

138
00:05:09,101 --> 00:05:10,686
TO SPILL THE BEANS.

139
00:05:11,687 --> 00:05:12,396
IF HE LIKES ME AT TWENTY,

140
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:15,148
HE'LL LIKE ME AT SEVENTEEN,
RIGHT?

141
00:05:17,985 --> 00:05:19,611
(EXHALES)

142
00:05:19,695 --> 00:05:20,696
(CHATTER)

143
00:05:22,489 --> 00:05:23,490
HOLLY J:
BON APPETIT!

144
00:05:23,574 --> 00:05:26,493
AND DON'T FORGET TO SAVE
SOME ROOM FOR DESSERT.

145
00:05:30,581 --> 00:05:31,832
ADAM:
TWELVE-TEN.

146
00:05:31,915 --> 00:05:34,376
GUESS SHE'S NOT COMING.

147
00:05:34,459 --> 00:05:36,795
FIONA:
HELLOOOOOO.

148
00:05:36,879 --> 00:05:38,255
YOU MADE IT.

149
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:39,715
HOW COULD I RESIST
SPENDING TIME

150
00:05:39,798 --> 00:05:42,301
WITH YOU, ELI
AND CLARE.

151
00:05:43,594 --> 00:05:45,012
YOU HAVE PRETTY EYES.

152
00:05:46,013 --> 00:05:47,014
UM, THANKS.

153
00:05:48,432 --> 00:05:50,976
THE COLOUR OF THAT SHIRT
DOES NOTHING FOR THEM.

154
00:05:51,059 --> 00:05:53,187
ELI:
DUDE, YOU NEED TO GET HER
OUTTA HERE; SHE'S WASTED.

155
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:54,897
IT'S NOT VERY NICE
TO WHISPER.

156
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:55,981
IS IT?

157
00:05:56,899 --> 00:05:58,901
COME ON.
LET'S GO FOR A WALK?

158
00:05:58,984 --> 00:06:00,694
BUT WE JUST GOT HERE.

159
00:06:00,777 --> 00:06:02,279
BESIDES, CLARE AND I...

160
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:03,822
ARE REALLY
HITTING IT OFF.

161
00:06:03,906 --> 00:06:05,282
CLARE:
(FAKE CHUCKLE)

162
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:08,619
NO, I WANT TO BE
ALONE WITH YOU.

163
00:06:08,702 --> 00:06:10,287
OH...

164
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:12,539
THAT TYPE OF WALK.
YEAH.

165
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:14,583
COME ON.

166
00:06:15,584 --> 00:06:16,752
WE SHOULD GO SHOPPING.

167
00:06:16,835 --> 00:06:17,836
CALL ME.

168
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:23,091
A WALK WAS
A GOOD IDEA.

169
00:06:23,175 --> 00:06:25,010
ADAM:
FIONA... FIONA, STOP.

170
00:06:26,011 --> 00:06:27,554
FIONA:
I THOUGHT YOU LIKED ME?

171
00:06:27,638 --> 00:06:29,014
YOU'RE DRUNK.

172
00:06:29,097 --> 00:06:30,265
DID HOLLY J TALK
TO YOU?

173
00:06:30,349 --> 00:06:31,266
WHAT?

174
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:33,769
SHE THINKS I DRINK
TOO MUCH.

175
00:06:33,852 --> 00:06:36,313
SHE DOESN'T UNDERSTAND ME
LIKE YOU DO.

176
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:38,690
SHE DOESN'T GET THAT
DRINKING MAKES IT EASIER.

177
00:06:38,774 --> 00:06:40,359
MAKES WHAT EASIER?

178
00:06:40,442 --> 00:06:42,194
BEING WITH YOU.

179
00:06:44,613 --> 00:06:46,823
YOU'RE DRINKING
BECAUSE OF ME?

180
00:06:46,907 --> 00:06:49,201
SEE?
YOU DO UNDERSTAND.

181
00:06:49,284 --> 00:06:50,285
NO...

182
00:06:51,745 --> 00:06:52,913
I DON'T.

183
00:06:54,122 --> 00:06:55,123
FIONA:
ADAM!

184
00:07:08,762 --> 00:07:11,348
DR. CHRIS:
UH, WHEN YOU CALLED EARLIER,
IT SOUNDED SERIOUS.

185
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:13,100
MM, IT'S JUST THIS
LITTLE THING.

186
00:07:13,183 --> 00:07:16,270
WHEN I TELL YOU,
YOU'LL PROBABLY LAUGH.

187
00:07:19,481 --> 00:07:22,025
ARE THOSE TICKETS
TO A RENAISSANCE FAIR?

188
00:07:22,109 --> 00:07:23,652
THERE'S ONE IN ITHACA
THIS WEEKEND.

189
00:07:23,735 --> 00:07:25,863
I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT
LIKE TO GO.

190
00:07:25,946 --> 00:07:26,947
UH...

191
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:28,824
IT'S TOO SOON,
ISN'T IT?

192
00:07:28,907 --> 00:07:30,492
I'LL RETURN THEM.

193
00:07:30,576 --> 00:07:32,953
UM, NO,
DON'T YOU DARE!

194
00:07:34,746 --> 00:07:37,124
THERE'S THIS AMAZING
BED AND BREAKFAST THERE.

195
00:07:37,207 --> 00:07:38,750
WE'D STAY OVERNIGHT?

196
00:07:38,834 --> 00:07:41,587
NO, I'D BOOK TWO ROOMS.
THERE'S NO PRESSURE.

197
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:43,088
UM, UH...
(NERVOUS CHUCKLE)

198
00:07:43,172 --> 00:07:44,298
THEN I GUESS I JUST HAVE
TO FIGURE OUT

199
00:07:44,381 --> 00:07:47,092
WHAT TO TELL MY MOM.
(GIGGLES)

200
00:07:48,093 --> 00:07:50,804
UH, BECAUSE WE WERE SUPPOSED
TO DO SOMETHING TOGETHER

201
00:07:50,888 --> 00:07:52,222
THIS WEEKEND.

202
00:07:53,223 --> 00:07:56,143
SO WHAT DID YOU WANT
TO TELL ME?

203
00:07:56,226 --> 00:07:57,561
OH THAT...

204
00:07:57,644 --> 00:07:59,646
UM, IT'S... IT'S...
NOT IMPORTANT.

205
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:11,533
COMEDY OR HORROR?
I CAN'T DECIDE.

206
00:08:11,617 --> 00:08:12,910
YEAH, I, UH...

207
00:08:12,993 --> 00:08:14,244
I DON'T THINK I'M GONNA
BE ABLE TO MAKE IT.

208
00:08:14,328 --> 00:08:16,747
SOMETHING CAME UP.

209
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:17,831
OH.

210
00:08:18,832 --> 00:08:20,501
MAYBE TOMORROW?

211
00:08:21,502 --> 00:08:22,920
YEAH, YEAH, MAYBE.

212
00:08:23,003 --> 00:08:24,171
(BELL RINGS)

213
00:08:24,254 --> 00:08:25,255
COOL.

214
00:08:29,259 --> 00:08:31,762
SO, READY FOR YOUR
BIG DATE TONIGHT?

215
00:08:31,845 --> 00:08:33,931
YEAH, I DON'T THINK
IT'S GONNA WORK OUT.

216
00:08:34,014 --> 00:08:36,266
ME AND SADIE,
WE HAVE NOTHING IN COMMON.

217
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:37,643
BUT SHE PLAYS BASKETBALL.

218
00:08:37,726 --> 00:08:39,186
AND YOU PLAY BASKETBALL.

219
00:08:39,269 --> 00:08:40,229
SHE LIKES HIP HOP.

220
00:08:40,312 --> 00:08:41,313
YOU LIKE HIP HOP.

221
00:08:41,396 --> 00:08:42,773
AND SHE LIKES YOU.

222
00:08:42,856 --> 00:08:45,067
AND YOU LIKE YOU -
A LOT.

223
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:46,652
(BOTH LAUGH)

224
00:08:46,735 --> 00:08:48,529
SO WHAT'S
THE PROBLEM?

225
00:08:48,612 --> 00:08:50,030
DAVE:
LOOK, MAN,
SHE'S A GIRAFFE, ALL RIGHT?

226
00:08:50,113 --> 00:08:51,698
SHE'S A BEAN POLE...

227
00:08:51,782 --> 00:08:53,283
A FREAK OF NATURE.

228
00:08:53,367 --> 00:08:55,369
AND YOU'RE A JERK.

229
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:01,625
ELI:
WE WERE LOOKING FOR YOU.

230
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:04,086
WE CANCELLED
REHEARSAL.

231
00:09:06,213 --> 00:09:07,965
ADAM:
SORRY ABOUT FIONA.

232
00:09:08,966 --> 00:09:10,384
CLARE:
DON'T BE.

233
00:09:10,467 --> 00:09:11,468
WOMEN ARE TROUBLE.

234
00:09:11,552 --> 00:09:12,845
EVEN ME?

235
00:09:12,928 --> 00:09:14,555
ESPECIALLY YOU.

236
00:09:15,556 --> 00:09:18,350
I WANT THAT -
WHAT YOU TWO HAVE.

237
00:09:19,351 --> 00:09:21,061
AND GET IT YOU WILL.

238
00:09:21,144 --> 00:09:24,439
BUT FOR RIGHT NOW,
LET'S BLOW THIS JOINT.

239
00:09:26,650 --> 00:09:28,652
FIONA:
DID I MISS REHEARSAL?

240
00:09:28,735 --> 00:09:30,988
THOUGHT IT STARTED AT FOUR.

241
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:35,325
CAN YOU GUYS GIVE US
A MINUTE?

242
00:09:35,409 --> 00:09:38,412
WE'LL BE OUT THERE
IF YOU NEED US.

243
00:09:42,541 --> 00:09:47,337
GUESS CLARE AND I WON'T BE
SHOPPING ANYTIME SOON.

244
00:09:47,421 --> 00:09:50,924
I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD
HANG OUT ANYMORE.

245
00:09:51,008 --> 00:09:53,051
BECAUSE OF WHAT
I SAID?

246
00:09:53,135 --> 00:09:55,971
I WAS STRESSED.
CONFUSED.

247
00:09:56,054 --> 00:09:59,099
ARE YOU DRINKING
BECAUSE OF ME?

248
00:10:00,392 --> 00:10:02,186
I CAN STOP.

249
00:10:02,269 --> 00:10:05,147
JUST, PLEASE,
DON'T LEAVE.

250
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:07,733
GIVE ME ONE GOOD REASON.

251
00:10:09,443 --> 00:10:11,862
I'M FALLING IN LOVE
WITH YOU.

252
00:10:11,945 --> 00:10:13,488
YOU'RE WHAT?

253
00:10:13,572 --> 00:10:15,490
I LOVE YOU, ADAM.

254
00:10:16,992 --> 00:10:19,244
I THOUGHT YOU FELT
THE SAME WAY.

255
00:10:20,245 --> 00:10:21,246
I DO.

256
00:10:23,207 --> 00:10:24,791
WALK ME HOME?

257
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:45,812
ANYA:
MOM! UM... (NERVOUS LAUGH)

258
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:48,690
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HOME?!

259
00:10:48,774 --> 00:10:50,567
I LEFT SOME FILES
ON THE COUNTER.

260
00:10:50,651 --> 00:10:52,069
WHY AREN'T YOU
AT SCHOOL?

261
00:10:52,152 --> 00:10:53,070
I WAS JUST HEADING BACK.

262
00:10:53,153 --> 00:10:55,197
WITHOUT YOUR UNIFORM?

263
00:10:56,198 --> 00:10:57,574
ANYA, WOULD YOU LIKE
TO TELL ME

264
00:10:57,658 --> 00:11:00,577
WHERE YOU'RE GOING
AND WITH WHOM?

265
00:11:00,661 --> 00:11:01,662
(EXHALES)

266
00:11:03,288 --> 00:11:05,082
UH, DR. CHRIS.

267
00:11:05,165 --> 00:11:06,583
WE'RE GOING TO THE RENAISSANCE
FAIR IN ITHACA.

268
00:11:06,667 --> 00:11:07,668
OH NO, YOU'RE NOT.

269
00:11:07,751 --> 00:11:09,962
BUT MOM-
NO BUTS ABOUT IT.

270
00:11:10,045 --> 00:11:11,755
WHAT KIND OF GUY
SKIPS TOWN

271
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:14,007
WITH A SEVENTEEN-YEAR-OLD
GIRL?

272
00:11:16,009 --> 00:11:17,761
HOW OLD DOES HE THINK
YOU ARE?

273
00:11:17,845 --> 00:11:19,555
(SIGHS) TWENTY...

274
00:11:20,889 --> 00:11:21,932
OH...
AND A HALF.

275
00:11:22,015 --> 00:11:23,016
ANYA!

276
00:11:24,351 --> 00:11:26,854
YOU HAVE TO TELL HIM
THE TRUTH.

277
00:11:26,937 --> 00:11:28,188
(SIGHS HEAVILY)

00:11:30,023 --> 00:11:40,117
♪♪♪

279
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,201
MISSED YOU.

280
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:46,123
FIONA:
SO, I WAS THINKING,
FOR OUR FIRST OFFICIAL DATE,

281
00:11:46,206 --> 00:11:47,791
A LATTE IN PARIS?

282
00:11:47,875 --> 00:11:49,168
PARIS?

283
00:11:49,251 --> 00:11:50,961
YOU'RE RIGHT. TOO CROWDED
IN THE SPRING.

284
00:11:51,044 --> 00:11:53,297
WHAT ABOUT A MACCHIATO
IN ROME.

285
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:55,090
(CHUCKLES)

286
00:11:55,174 --> 00:11:56,633
LET ME COME UP
WITH SOMETHING.

287
00:11:56,717 --> 00:11:57,843
IT'LL BE A SURPRISE.

288
00:11:57,926 --> 00:11:59,761
FIONA:
PERFETTO.

289
00:12:01,096 --> 00:12:04,057
I GOTTA GO.
I'LL SEE YOU AFTER CLASS.

290
00:12:07,019 --> 00:12:08,979
FIONA PULLS YOU IN.

291
00:12:09,062 --> 00:12:10,314
YOU WANNA BELIEVE
WHAT SHE SAYS;

292
00:12:10,397 --> 00:12:12,065
THAT SHE DOESN'T
HAVE A PROBLEM.

293
00:12:12,149 --> 00:12:13,901
UM, HAD A PROBLEM.

294
00:12:13,984 --> 00:12:15,485
SHE WAS ONLY DRINKING
'CAUSE SHE WAS STRESSED.

295
00:12:15,569 --> 00:12:17,529
I THINK FIONA'S
AN ALCOHOLIC

296
00:12:17,613 --> 00:12:18,822
AND YOU'RE ENABLING HER.

297
00:12:18,906 --> 00:12:21,575
NO. (LAUGHS)
NO, YOU'RE WRONG.

298
00:12:21,658 --> 00:12:24,077
SHE NEEDS HELP -
REHAB.

299
00:12:25,746 --> 00:12:29,082
HER MOM AND I ARE ORGANIZING
AN INTERVENTION FOR TONIGHT,

300
00:12:29,166 --> 00:12:30,876
AND I THINK
YOU SHOULD BE THERE.

301
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:33,170
SO YOU'RE TAKING HER
AWAY?

302
00:12:33,253 --> 00:12:36,089
WE'VE TRIED
EVERYTHING ELSE.

303
00:12:43,263 --> 00:12:44,181
LET'S TAKE OFF.

304
00:12:44,264 --> 00:12:45,516
WHERE TO?

305
00:12:45,599 --> 00:12:48,185
FAR AWAY FROM HERE.

306
00:12:48,268 --> 00:12:50,187
OKAY. I JUST NEED
TO GO HOME FIRST,

307
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:51,396
PACK SOME ESSENTIALS.

308
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:54,483
THIS IS NOT THE RIGHT OUTFIT
FOR AN ADVENTURE.

309
00:12:54,566 --> 00:12:57,444
OKAY. WHATEVER.
LET'S JUST GO.

310

00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:00,781
GREAT!

313
00:13:01,865 --> 00:13:03,867
WESLEY:
YOU STILL LIKE HER.

314
00:13:03,951 --> 00:13:05,369
YOU KNOW, THERE'S A LOT
OF ADVANTAGES

315
00:13:05,452 --> 00:13:06,787
TO DATING A TALLER GIRL.

316
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:08,038
SHE LOOKS OLDER
FOR STARTERS.

317
00:13:08,121 --> 00:13:09,289
CONNOR:
AND SHE CAN REACH THINGS
YOU CAN'T.

318
00:13:09,373 --> 00:13:10,207
WESLEY:
GOOD ONE, CONNOR.

319
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:11,625
AND TALLER PEOPLE TEND TO BE
MORE SUCCESSFUL IN LIFE.

320
00:13:11,708 --> 00:13:13,502
LOOK, KNOCK IT OFF,
GUYS, ALL RIGHT?

321
00:13:13,585 --> 00:13:16,213
I CAN'T DATE SADIE.
SHE'S FREAKISH.

322
00:13:16,296 --> 00:13:20,217
WESLEY:
DAVE, I DON'T THINK SADIE'S
HEIGHT'S THE PROBLEM.

323
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:22,219
THEN WHAT IS?

324
00:13:22,302 --> 00:13:23,887
YOURS.

325
00:13:23,971 --> 00:13:24,805
LOOK, EVERYONE WHO SEES ME
WITH HER

326
00:13:24,888 --> 00:13:26,557
IS GONNA THINK
I'M A SHRIMP.

327
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:27,933
BUT YOU ARE
A SHRIMP.

328
00:13:28,016 --> 00:13:31,478
YEAH, AND A SHORTER GIRLFRIEND
WON'T CHANGE THAT.

329
00:13:33,397 --> 00:13:35,899
I MEAN, WE DO HAVE
A LOT IN COMMON.

330
00:13:35,983 --> 00:13:37,025
I DON'T KNOW.

331
00:13:37,818 --> 00:13:39,069
I DON'T THINK
SHE'LL NEVER FORGIVE ME.

332
00:13:39,152 --> 00:13:41,488
WESLEY:
OH, COME ON.
DON'T SELL YOURSELF SHORT.

333
00:13:41,572 --> 00:13:42,614
(LAUGHING)

334
00:13:55,002 --> 00:13:56,003

335
00:14:00,007 --> 00:14:02,426
DR. CHRIS:
YOU'RE RIGHT ON TIME,

336
00:14:02,509 --> 00:14:04,678
AND YOU'RE A LIGHT PACKER.

337
00:14:07,598 --> 00:14:10,767
PAM, UH...
WHAT'RE YOU DOING HERE?

338
00:14:13,353 --> 00:14:14,897
DID I DO
SOMETHING WRONG?

339
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:19,276
(SIGHS) I HAVEN'T BEEN
COMPLETELY HONEST WITH YOU.

340
00:14:19,359 --> 00:14:22,946
I'M A LITTLE YOUNGER
THAN I SAID I WAS.

341
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:24,406
NINETEEN?

342
00:14:24,489 --> 00:14:25,490
CLOSE.

343
00:14:26,575 --> 00:14:27,618
EIGHTEEN?

344
00:14:28,619 --> 00:14:29,536
ALMOST.

345
00:14:30,537 --> 00:14:32,623
YOU'RE SEVENTEEN.

346
00:14:32,706 --> 00:14:33,749
OH MY GOD!

347
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:37,085
PAM, I HAD NO IDEA.

348
00:14:38,086 --> 00:14:40,923
I WAS GOING AWAY
WITH YOU.

349
00:14:41,006 --> 00:14:44,343
COME ON, ANYA.
IT'S TIME TO GO HOME.

350
00:14:44,426 --> 00:14:47,054
UH... PAM, IT WAS, UH,
NICE SEEING YOU.

351
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:51,141
AND ANYA, I REALLY
ENJOYED DINNER.

352
00:14:51,225 --> 00:14:53,101
YEAH, ME TOO.

353
00:14:53,185 --> 00:14:54,269
PAM:
IT'S GONNA BE OKAY,
HONEY.

354
00:14:54,353 --> 00:14:57,439
ANYA:
NO, IT'S NOT.

TO HER CONDO

TO PACK HER A BAG
FOR REHAB,

464
00:20:34,401 --> 00:20:35,944
I FOUND THIS.

465

FROM HER JOURNAL.

466
00:20:39,406 --> 00:20:40,741

FOR GIVING THIS TO YOU,

YOU'VE DONE...

YOU'VE JUST LEFT...

AND I CAN'T STOP
THINKING ABOUT YOU -

471
00:20:59,593 --> 00:21:02,930
YOUR FACE, YOUR VOICE,
YOUR TOUCH;

472
00:21:07,434 --> 00:21:11,855
HOW YOU LISTEN TO ME
THE WAY NO ONE ELSE DOES;

473
00:21:11,939 --> 00:21:15,859
HOW IT'S EASIER
TO BE WITH YOU THAN NOT;

474
00:21:15,943 --> 00:21:19,780
HOW WHEN WE'RE TOGETHER,
I NEVER WANT IT TO END.

475
00:21:22,991 --> 00:21:27,120
I'D BE EASIER
IF I DIDN'T FEEL THIS WAY

476
00:21:27,204 --> 00:21:32,543
CUZ THERE ARE A MILLION REASONS
WHY WE SHOULDN'T WORK.

477
00:21:32,626 --> 00:21:35,462
BUT EVEN THOUGH I KNOW THAT,

478
00:21:35,963 --> 00:21:38,799
I REALLY, REALLY HOPE
THAT WE WILL.
