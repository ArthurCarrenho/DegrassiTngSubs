00:00:09,259 --> 00:00:10,552
OR SOMETHING.

6
00:00:10,636 --> 00:00:12,513
HOLLY J DOESN'T STAND A CHANCE.

7
00:00:12,596 --> 00:00:14,264
I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW HOLLY J
AND SAV WERE TOGETHER,

8
00:00:14,348 --> 00:00:16,975
AND I KNOW EVERYTHING.

9
00:00:17,059 --> 00:00:18,560
I'M LOSING MY TOUCH!

10
00:00:18,644 --> 00:00:20,812
THERE'S A REASON
THEY'RE NOT TELLING ANYONE.

11
00:00:20,896 --> 00:00:22,272
OH, IS THERE NOW?

12
00:00:22,356 --> 00:00:23,524
JENNA:
THEY'RE NOT IN LOVE.

13
00:00:23,607 --> 00:00:24,816
CHECK OUT THEIR BODY LANGUAGE.

14
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:27,819
HOW ARE YOU SO SURE
HE'S INTERESTED IN YOU?

15
00:00:27,903 --> 00:00:29,613
I HAVE A SIXTH SENSE
WITH THESE KIND OF THINGS.

16
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:32,199
A SIXTH SENSE
AIN'T GONNA CUT IT.

17
00:00:32,282 --> 00:00:33,909
AND I HAVE PROOF.

18
00:00:33,992 --> 00:00:35,244
WE KISSED!

19
00:00:35,327 --> 00:00:37,120
