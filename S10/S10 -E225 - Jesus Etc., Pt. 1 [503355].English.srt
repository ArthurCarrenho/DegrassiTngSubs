540
00:21:21,907 --> 00:21:22,824

AND FROM THE MOMENT
YOU'VE COME TO DEGRASSI,

544
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:29,706

A LIVING HELL!

545
00:21:29,790 --> 00:21:31,500
I AM SICK AND TIRED

546
00:21:31,583 --> 00:21:33,669
OF YOUR BEING STUPID

547
00:21:36,630 --> 00:21:37,548
I THOUGHT YOU WERE
THE ONE PERSON

548
00:21:37,631 --> 00:21:39,007
