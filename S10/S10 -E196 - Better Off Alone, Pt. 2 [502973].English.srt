MISS EDWARDS,
WHY DON'T YOU GO FIRST?

177
00:07:33,537 --> 00:07:34,454
ME?

178
00:07:34,538 --> 00:07:36,248
MS. DAWES:
YEAH. COME ON.

179
00:07:36,331 --> 00:07:37,666
WE'LL SEE IF THE ASSIGNMENT

180
00:07:37,749 --> 00:07:40,919
HELPED WITH
YOUR WRITER'S BLOCK.

181
00:07:50,888 --> 00:07:52,556
"'WE NEED TO TALK'

182
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:54,850
IS A LINE THAT
EVERY KID DREADS.

183
00:07:55,851 --> 00:07:57,895
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT'S WORSE?

184
00:07:57,978 --> 00:07:59,605
WAITING FOR IT,

185
00:07:59,688 --> 00:08:03,483
EVERY MINUTE OF EVERY HOUR
OF EVERY DAY.

186
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:08,739
BECAUSE I KNOW IT'S COMING,

187
00:08:11,867 --> 00:08:14,244
THE REASON WHY YOU'RE FIGHTING
ALL THE TIME,

188
00:08:14,328 --> 00:08:17,539
AND I KNOW I WON'T LIKE
THE ANSWER.

189
00:08:17,623 --> 00:08:18,957
BUT WHATEVER YOU TELL ME

190
00:08:19,041 --> 00:08:21,418
CAN'T BE WORSE
THAN THE WAITING.

191
00:08:21,502 --> 00:08:25,047

NO, THAT'S ALL RIGHT.
IT'S A GOOD START.

198
00:08:37,017 --> 00:08:40,479
I THINK IT DESERVES
A LARGER AUDIENCE,

199
00:08:40,562 --> 00:08:42,272
LIKE AT THE STUDENT SHOWCASE
TOMORROW.

200
00:08:42,356 --> 00:08:45,275
THAT'S A FANTASTIC IDEA.

(WHISPERING)
MY MOM'S GONNA BE
AT THE SHOWCASE!

206
00:09:00,165 --> 00:09:01,917
WHICH MEANS SHE'LL BE FORCED
TO LISTEN TO YOU.

207
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,711
ISN'T THIS
WHAT YOU WANTED?

208
00:09:13,053 --> 00:09:14,930
KC:
THOSE ARE LAST YEARS GRADES.

209
00:09:15,013 --> 00:09:17,349
BUT MY MARKS THIS YEAR
ARE WAY HIGHER.

210
00:09:17,432 --> 00:09:20,477
I CAN SEE THAT.
THANK YOU.

212

213
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:25,232
LET THE LAWYER REVIEW
YOUR FILE.

214
00:09:25,315 --> 00:09:26,233
DOES HE KNOW ABOUT HOW SHE-?

215
00:09:26,316 --> 00:09:30,153
I'VE GOT A COMPLETE PICTURE
OF THE SITUATION.

216
00:09:30,237 --> 00:09:32,155
YOU'RE SURE YOU'D RATHER
STAY IN THE HOME

217
00:09:32,239 --> 00:09:33,156

218

FOR KC.

IT'S UP TO THE JUDGE.

230
00:09:56,430 --> 00:09:57,848

ARE YOU APPLYING FOR?

243
00:10:25,167 --> 00:10:27,544
WELL,
IT'S NOT EXACTLY A JOB.

244
00:10:27,628 --> 00:10:29,963
I NEED SOMEONE TO TESTIFY THAT
I'M BETTER OFF WITHOUT MY MOM.

245

(HESITANT EXHALE)

352
00:15:12,829 --> 00:15:14,873
UM, WELL,

353
00:15:14,957 --> 00:15:17,960
MY PARENTS WON'T BE HOME
FOR ANOTHER HOUR.

354
00:15:18,043 --> 00:15:19,044
PERFECT.

355
00:15:27,761 --> 00:15:28,762
(DOOR SHUTS)

356
00:15:29,847 --> 00:15:31,849
MRS. EDWARDS:
THERE YOU ARE.
WHAT HAPPENED?!

357
00:15:31,932 --> 00:15:32,975
I THOUGHT YOU WERE SUPPOSED
TO READ SOMETHING

358
00:15:33,058 --> 00:15:34,768
AT THE SHOWCASE.

359
00:15:34,852 --> 00:15:36,520
I GOT COLD FEET.

360
00:15:37,521 --> 00:15:40,399
STAGE FRIGHT'S NOT LIKE YOU.
IS EVERYTHING OKAY?

361
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:51,159
YOU TELL ME.

362
00:15:51,243 --> 00:15:53,078
WHAT'S THIS?

363
00:15:53,161 --> 00:15:56,874
THE PIECE I WAS SUPPOSED
TO READ TODAY.

364
00:16:09,052 --> 00:16:10,554
WHAT'S GOING ON
WITH YOU AND DAD?

365
00:16:12,806 --> 00:16:13,974
ARE YOU...

366
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:19,229
ARE YOU GETTING
A DIVORCE?

367
00:16:20,689 --> 00:16:22,149
I WISH I COULD TELL YOU.

368
00:16:22,232 --> 00:16:23,984
YOU CAN.
I'M NOT A KID.

369
00:16:24,067 --> 00:16:25,319
BUT YOU ARE A KID,
CLARE,

370
00:16:25,402 --> 00:16:27,362
AND YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE TO WORRY
ABOUT YOUR FATHER AND ME.

371
00:16:27,446 --> 00:16:28,655
BUT I CAN'T JUST IGNORE
THE FACT

372
00:16:28,739 --> 00:16:31,158
THAT SOMETHING'S WRONG!

373
00:16:32,409 --> 00:16:33,744
WHAT IS IT?

374
00:16:35,162 --> 00:16:36,455
I DON'T KNOW.

375
00:16:37,456 --> 00:16:38,749
YOUR FATHER DOESN'T WANT
TO SPEND TIME WITH ME,

376
00:16:38,832 --> 00:16:42,085
AND NOTHING I DO
SEEMS TO CHANGE THAT.

377
00:16:42,169 --> 00:16:43,921
SO ASK HIM WHY.

378
00:16:45,130 --> 00:16:49,468
I'M WORRIED ABOUT WHAT
THE ANSWER WILL BE.

379
00:16:49,551 --> 00:16:52,554
I NEED TO KNOW, MOM.
DON'T YOU?

380
00:16:55,474 --> 00:16:58,101
I'LL TALK TO HIM TONIGHT.

381
00:17:02,439 --> 00:17:03,440
MR. SIMPSON:
(SIGHING)

382
00:17:09,363 --> 00:17:10,364
WHAT'S GOING ON?

383
00:17:11,365 --> 00:17:13,116
COACH ARMSTRONG ASKED ME
TO CALL THIS MEETING

384
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:15,077
BECAUSE HE'S CONCERNED
ABOUT YOU.

385
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:16,912
THAT'S CRAP.

386
00:17:16,995 --> 00:17:17,871
EXCUSE ME?

387
00:17:17,955 --> 00:17:19,206
IF HE CARED ABOUT ME,
HE WOULD HAVE HELPED.

388
00:17:20,999 --> 00:17:23,627
KC, I'M JUST YOUR COACH.

389
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:25,337
KC:
SO, IS THIS AN INTERVENTION?

390
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:26,672
SIMPSON:
NO, IT'S NOT.
SIT DOWN.

391
00:17:29,132 --> 00:17:30,467
(TELEPHONE RINGS
IN DISTANCE)

392
00:17:31,635 --> 00:17:32,845
WE'LL WAIT.

393
00:17:37,975 --> 00:17:38,976
NOW, WE WANT TO DISCUSS

394
00:17:39,059 --> 00:17:40,310
WHAT'S BEEN GOING ON
WITH YOU LATELY.

395
00:17:40,394 --> 00:17:42,396
WE KNOW YOU DIDN'T SLEEP
AT YOUR MOM'S LAST NIGHT.

396
00:17:42,479 --> 00:17:43,981
AND YOU'VE BEEN ACTING OUT
AT PRACTICE.

397
00:17:44,064 --> 00:17:45,649
AND THERE'S ALSO
THE, UH,

398
00:17:45,732 --> 00:17:47,901
LITTLE INCIDENT WITH
COACH ARMSTRONG'S CAR.

399
00:17:47,985 --> 00:17:49,152
I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT THAT.

400
00:17:49,236 --> 00:17:50,445
ARE YOU SURE?

401
00:17:50,529 --> 00:17:50,988
LISA:
(SNORTS)

402
00:17:51,071 --> 00:17:52,739
IS THIS WHAT YOU DO
AT THIS SCHOOL?

403
00:17:52,823 --> 00:17:56,410
YOU ACCUSE THE POOR KID
OF EVERY CRIME?

404
00:17:56,493 --> 00:17:57,494
WELL...

405
00:17:57,578 --> 00:17:58,912
NO, OF COURSE NOT.

406
00:17:58,996 --> 00:18:02,249
THEN I ASSUME YOU HAVE
SOME PROOF THAT KC'S GUILTY?

407
00:18:02,332 --> 00:18:03,750
LOOK, WE JUST WANT TO GET
TO THE BOTTOM OF THIS THING.

408
00:18:03,834 --> 00:18:05,878
BUT YOU FIGURE
THE MOM DID JAIL TIME

409
00:18:05,961 --> 00:18:07,421
SO THE KID'S A BAD SEED!

410
00:18:07,504 --> 00:18:08,297
SIMPSON:
MISS GUTHRIE,

411
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:09,756
WE WOULD NOT JUMP
TO CONCLUSIONS LIKE THAT.

412
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:11,091
(SLAPS HAND ON DESK)
GOOD!

413
00:18:11,175 --> 00:18:12,176
THEN I GUESS WE'RE DONE!

414
00:18:18,265 --> 00:18:19,433
(CLEARS HER THROAT)

415
00:18:19,516 --> 00:18:21,143
IS THERE SOMEWHERE
I CAN TALK TO MY KID?

416
00:18:23,812 --> 00:18:25,063
TAKE YOUR TIME.

417
00:18:37,367 --> 00:18:38,452
WHY'D YOU COVER FOR ME?

418
00:18:38,535 --> 00:18:40,329
'CAUSE YOU'RE MY SON.

419
00:18:40,412 --> 00:18:44,124
I NOT GONNA LET ANYBODY
MESS WITH YOU.

420
00:18:44,208 --> 00:18:45,375
EVEN ME.

421
00:18:47,336 --> 00:18:48,253
I KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE

422
00:18:48,337 --> 00:18:49,963
TO NOT HAVE CONTROL
OVER YOUR LIFE,

423
00:18:50,047 --> 00:18:51,381
AND I WOULDN'T WISH IT
ON ANYBODY.

424
00:18:51,465 --> 00:18:54,968
SO, IF YOU WANT TO STAY
IN THE GROUP HOME,

425
00:18:55,052 --> 00:18:56,803
I NOT GONNA FIGHT YA.

426
00:19:04,436 --> 00:19:06,146
(CAR DOOR SLAMS SHUT)

427
00:19:09,191 --> 00:19:10,734
WHAT'RE YOU DOING HERE?

428
00:19:10,817 --> 00:19:12,027
HI, ELI, HOW ARE YOU?

429
00:19:12,110 --> 00:19:14,196
FINE, CLARE,
THANKS FOR ASKING.

430
00:19:14,279 --> 00:19:15,280
HI.

431
00:19:18,242 --> 00:19:20,077
IF YOU DON'T WANNA TELL YOUR MOM
HOW YOU'RE FEELING,

432
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,870
I RESPECT THAT.

433
00:19:21,954 --> 00:19:23,038
TOO LATE.

434
00:19:24,039 --> 00:19:25,374
YOU READ HER THE LETTER?

435
00:19:25,457 --> 00:19:27,626
AND SHE WANTS TO KNOW
WHAT'S WRONG AS MUCH AS I DO.

436
00:19:27,709 --> 00:19:30,379
SHE AND MY DAD
ARE TALKING RIGHT NOW.

437
00:19:30,462 --> 00:19:33,382
SO WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS...
MY PLAN WORKED?

438
00:19:33,465 --> 00:19:35,175
(SMALL LAUGH)
COULD YOU BE MORE SMUG?

439
00:19:35,259 --> 00:19:37,636
ABSOLUTELY.

441

TO BORROW THESE.

442

THEY'RE NOISE
CANCELLATION.

00:19:42,641 --> 00:19:43,559

WITH YOUR FOLKS.

AN ENGLISH PARTNER.

446
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:48,897
THANKS.

447
00:19:48,981 --> 00:19:50,566
AND I'M SORRY
FOR INTERFERING.

448
00:19:50,649 --> 00:19:53,610

NOT TO DO IT AGAIN.

WHATEVER I WANT.
