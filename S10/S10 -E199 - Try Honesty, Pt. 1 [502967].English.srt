533
00:20:46,997 --> 00:20:47,915
WHAT ABOUT THAT GUY,

534
00:20:47,998 --> 00:20:51,418
WITH THE FRECKLES
AND SQUINTY EYES?

535
00:20:51,502 --> 00:20:53,629
I THINK WE HAVE OUR MAN.

536
00:20:53,712 --> 00:20:54,630

00:20:54,713 --> 00:20:56,423

EVERY COP IN THE COUNTRY
WILL WANT FITZ'S HEAD

540
00:21:00,719 --> 00:21:01,637
IN THEIR TROPHY CASE.

541
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:03,555
ALL WE HAVE TO DO IS POINT THEM
IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION.

542
00:21:03,639 --> 00:21:05,057
YEAH, BUT-
ADAM!

543
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:08,185
MY FRIEND,
OUR BULLY CROSSED THE LINE.

544
00:21:08,268 --> 00:21:10,604

WHO NOT TO MESS WITH.

545
00:21:11,605 --> 00:21:12,606

546
00:21:23,242 --> 00:21:25,911

00:21:27,913 --> 00:21:28,956
SHE'S NOT GONNA
MAKE IT.

549
00:21:32,209 --> 00:21:33,210

550
00:21:33,293 --> 00:21:35,587
