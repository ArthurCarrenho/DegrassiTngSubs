(LAUGHS)

357
00:15:51,326 --> 00:15:55,831
WANT ME TO TELL THE WHOLE SCHOOL
I MADE IT UP?

358
00:15:55,914 --> 00:15:57,916
THEY CAN THINK
WHAT THEY WANT.

359
00:16:05,757 --> 00:16:07,384
(SCHOOL BELL RINGS)

360
00:16:09,136 --> 00:16:12,639

OKAY, WE'LL FINISH UP
TOMORROW.

00:16:21,315 --> 00:16:23,358

ANYA! WAIT UP.

362
00:16:23,442 --> 00:16:24,818
(SIGHS)
IT'S OKAY, SAV.

363
00:16:24,902 --> 00:16:25,819
YOU DON'T HAVE
TO APOLOGIZE.

364
00:16:25,903 --> 00:16:27,196
YES, I DO.

365
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:29,573
I SHOULDN'T HAVE LIED
TO MY MOM.

366
00:16:29,656 --> 00:16:31,742
BUT YOU DID.
AGAIN.

367
00:16:36,705 --> 00:16:39,249
WE ARE BAD FOR EACH OTHER,

368
00:16:39,333 --> 00:16:41,877
AND UNTIL YOU LEARN
TO STAND UP TO YOUR PARENTS,

369
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:42,961
THAT'S NEVER GONNA CHANGE.

370
00:16:43,045 --> 00:16:45,923
ANYA, COME ON.
I'M SORRY.

371
00:16:46,006 --> 00:16:48,634
GOOD LUCK,
MR. PRESIDENT.

372
00:16:52,054 --> 00:16:53,388
YOU KNOW, IT'S PROBABLY
NOT TOO LATE

373
00:16:53,472 --> 00:16:54,890

♪ For his true love the moon ♪

377
00:17:14,618 --> 00:17:15,619
THANKS.

378
00:17:16,578 --> 00:17:18,830
OKAY, SO I'VE NARROWED IT DOWN
TO THREE OPTIONS.

379
00:17:18,914 --> 00:17:20,415
ARE YOU SURE
YOU WANT A CONDO

380
00:17:20,499 --> 00:17:22,251
IN THIS ONE HORSE TOWN?

381
00:17:22,334 --> 00:17:23,794
I LIKE IT HERE.

382
00:17:23,877 --> 00:17:27,005
THIS CITY, THIS PLACE,
DEGRASSI.

383
00:17:27,089 --> 00:17:29,258
EVERYTHING IS PERFECT.

384
00:17:30,259 --> 00:17:32,302
UGH!
EXCEPT FOR THE COFFEE.

385
00:17:32,386 --> 00:17:33,387
BUT SERIOUSLY,

386
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:36,014
I ONLY HAVE ONE FRIEND
IN THE WHOLE WORLD.

387
00:17:36,098 --> 00:17:38,517
I'M SO LUCKY THAT IT'S YOU.

388
00:17:39,518 --> 00:17:41,812
YEAH, I'M LUCKY, TOO.

389
00:17:44,815 --> 00:17:45,732
THAT'S WEIRD.

00:17:45,816 --> 00:17:48,110
WHAT, NOT ENOUGH

391
00:17:48,193 --> 00:17:49,278
NO, I, I JUST...

392
00:17:49,361 --> 00:17:52,614
DON'T REMEMBER MAKING
AN EMAIL TRANSFER.

393
00:17:52,698 --> 00:17:55,492
WELL, YOU ARE A FREQUENT
ONLINE SHOPPER.

394
00:17:55,576 --> 00:17:59,872
YEAH, BUT I KEEP TRACK.
WHEN WOULD I HAVE...?

395
00:18:02,916 --> 00:18:04,585
HOW MUCH WAS
YOUR S.A.T. COURSE?

396
00:18:06,336 --> 00:18:09,006
MM, I'M NOT SURE.
A BUNCH.

397
00:18:10,299 --> 00:18:14,386
I TOLD YOU MY PASSWORD.
DID YOU DO THIS?

398
00:18:16,054 --> 00:18:17,055
NO!

399
00:18:23,228 --> 00:18:25,480
(SIGHS) YES.

400
00:18:25,564 --> 00:18:27,065
YOU STOLE FROM ME?

401
00:18:27,149 --> 00:18:28,567
BORROWED.

402
00:18:28,650 --> 00:18:29,943
I REALLY THOUGHT
I COULD PAY IT BACK

403
00:18:30,027 --> 00:18:32,112
BEFORE YOU NOTICED.

404
00:18:32,196 --> 00:18:34,489
I DIDN'T HAVE
ANY OTHER WAY.

405
00:18:34,573 --> 00:18:35,657
HOW COULD YOU DO THIS?

406
00:18:35,741 --> 00:18:38,327
IT WAS A MISTAKE.
IT WAS A HUGE MISTAKE.

407
00:18:38,410 --> 00:18:40,662
AFTER BOBBY, I CAME HERE
BECAUSE OF YOU.

408
00:18:40,746 --> 00:18:41,997
YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO BE
THE ONE PERSON

409
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:42,998
IN THE WHOLE WORLD

410
00:18:43,081 --> 00:18:44,208
THAT I COULD TRUST.

411
00:18:44,291 --> 00:18:46,001
BUT YOU USED ME.

412
00:18:46,084 --> 00:18:47,669
WHY, HOLLY J?

413
00:18:50,172 --> 00:18:52,716
I'M BROKE.

414
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:55,344
YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT IT'S LIKE.

415
00:18:55,427 --> 00:18:56,678
YEAH, WELL,
THE SADDEST PART,

416
00:18:56,762 --> 00:18:58,764
IF YOU HAD JUST ASKED,
I WOULD'VE GIVEN YOU THE MONEY.

I GIVE YOU A NINE
FOR MAKING JENNA SQUIRM,

419
00:19:11,276 --> 00:19:13,570

CLARE:
IT WAS PRETTY SATISFYING.

421
00:19:16,281 --> 00:19:18,867
I HARDLY RECOGNIZE YOU
ANY MORE.

422
00:19:18,951 --> 00:19:20,536
AND YET, SO FEW PEOPLE
HAVE NOTICED

423
00:19:20,619 --> 00:19:22,496
HOW I REALLY CHANGED.

424
00:19:22,579 --> 00:19:24,122
MAYBE I SHOULD JUST,
I DON'T KNOW,

425
00:19:24,206 --> 00:19:25,707
GO BACK TO THE OLD ME.

426
00:19:25,791 --> 00:19:27,459
UH, NO WAY!
GIVE ME THOSE.

427
00:19:27,543 --> 00:19:29,628

OH! MY GLASSES!

429
00:19:39,721 --> 00:19:41,932
I THINK THEY'RE DEAD.

430
00:19:42,015 --> 00:19:43,225
IT-IT'S OKAY.

431
00:19:43,308 --> 00:19:46,478
I, UH, I DON'T NEED THEM
ANY MORE.

432
00:19:47,479 --> 00:19:49,481
GOT LASER SURGERY.

433
00:19:53,485 --> 00:19:55,279
YOU HAVE PRETTY EYES.

434
00:19:55,362 --> 00:19:56,363
THANKS.

435
00:19:57,656 --> 00:20:00,492
I'LL, UH,
SEE YOU AROUND?

436
00:20:00,576 --> 00:20:02,244
I GUESS YOU WILL.

437
00:20:09,334 --> 00:20:10,252
ALLI:
UH-OH.

438
00:20:10,335 --> 00:20:11,670
I'VE SEEN THAT LOOK
BEFORE.

439
00:20:11,753 --> 00:20:14,673
I HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

440
00:20:25,684 --> 00:20:26,935
NEW LOCKER.

441
00:20:27,019 --> 00:20:28,687
SO I GUESS
YOU'RE STAYING?

442
00:20:30,355 --> 00:20:32,399
I CALLED YOU A MILLION TIMES
LAST NIGHT.

443
00:20:32,482 --> 00:20:34,776
(SIGHS)
I'D STILL RATHER BE HERE.

444
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:39,114
DON'T WORRY.
I DIDN'T TELL DECLAN.

445
00:20:39,198 --> 00:20:40,199
THANKS.

446
00:20:41,283 --> 00:20:42,367
PLEASE, FIONA.

447
00:20:42,451 --> 00:20:44,286
LOOK, I KNOW
I MADE A MISTAKE,

448
00:20:44,369 --> 00:20:45,662
BUT YOU HAVE
TO FORGIVE ME.

449
00:20:45,746 --> 00:20:47,372
WHY?

450
00:20:47,456 --> 00:20:48,373
BECAUSE WE'RE BOTH
LACKING

451
00:20:48,457 --> 00:20:51,126
IN THE FRIEND DEPARTMENT.

452
00:20:51,210 --> 00:20:53,295
WE NEED EACH OTHER.

453
00:20:56,173 --> 00:20:57,883
(SIGHS)
SO THAT MONEY THING.

454
00:20:57,966 --> 00:21:01,637
THAT WAS JUST...
BAD JUDGMENT, RIGHT?

455
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:04,681
IT'LL NEVER,
NEVER HAPPEN AGAIN.

456
00:21:04,765 --> 00:21:08,143
AND I'LL FIND A WAY
TO PAY YOU BACK.

457
00:21:08,227 --> 00:21:09,645

OH. OKAY.

461
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:19,738
GOOD.

462
00:21:19,821 --> 00:21:20,906
SO, I'M GONNA SLEEP OVER
TONIGHT.

463
00:21:20,989 --> 00:21:22,157
TOO MANY NIGHTS
IN A HOTEL.

464
00:21:22,241 --> 00:21:24,076
MY PLACE?
WITH ALL THE BOXES?

465
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:25,994
NO BIGGIE.
OH, ANOTHER THING!

466
00:21:26,078 --> 00:21:27,788
I'M TRANSFERRING INTO
YOUR HISTORY CLASS.

467
00:21:27,871 --> 00:21:29,164
OH, AND CALCULUS.

468
00:21:29,248 --> 00:21:30,332
DO YOU HAVE FRENCH
THIS SEMESTER?

469
00:21:30,415 --> 00:21:32,459
YEAH. WHY?

470
00:21:32,543 --> 00:21:34,461
SWITCH IT TO NEXT,
SO WE CAN HELP EACH OTHER.

471
00:21:34,545 --> 00:21:36,505
SURE. YOU GOT IT.

472
00:21:36,588 --> 00:21:38,549
WALK ME TO CLASS?

473
00:21:41,802 --> 00:21:43,929

ABOUT THIS YEAR.
