00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:24,705
NO. I DON'T NEED YOU

00:03:31,253 --> 00:03:33,297

WELL, SHE'D BE SO LONELY
IN THAT BIG CONDO BY HERSELF,

91
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:45,100
AND I'D NEVER LEAVE

PERINO:
THAT'S GOOD,

93
00:03:46,268 --> 00:03:48,228
BECAUSE YOU PROBABLY SHOULD
GO HOME TOGETHER.

94
00:03:48,312 --> 00:03:50,522
BUT MR. PERINO,
CAN YOU REALLY KICK THIS FACE

95
00:03:50,606 --> 00:03:51,607

FINE, THEN STAY.

97
00:03:52,691 --> 00:03:56,612
BUT I'M WARNING YOU,

FOR THE CALENDAR SHOOT!

108
00:04:28,143 --> 00:04:31,063
YOU KNOW, THREE POUNDS MIGHT
JUST BE WATER WEIGHT.

109
00:04:31,146 --> 00:04:32,356
IT'S NOT. TRUST ME.

110
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:35,859

UH, SO YOU'RE TAKING PILLS
THAT AREN'T EVEN YOURS

115
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:46,912
THAT CLAIM TO DO SOMETHING
THAT ISN'T EVEN POSSIBLE?

116
00:04:46,995 --> 00:04:49,414
NO, THEY WORK.
THEY MAKE ME LIKE YOU!

117
00:04:49,498 --> 00:04:51,625
HOW IS THAT
ANYTHING LIKE ME?

118

I CAN EAT WHATEVER I WANT,

119
00:04:52,626 --> 00:04:53,794
AND THEN I TAKE THESE BABIES

120
00:04:53,877 --> 00:04:56,505
AND THEY STOP MY BODY
FROM ABSORBING THE FAT!

121
00:04:56,588 --> 00:04:59,299
AH... AND HAVE YOU SEEN

NOTHING BAD'S HAPPENED YET!

123
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:03,512
AND BESIDES,
SOME THINGS ARE WORTH IT.

124
00:05:03,595 --> 00:05:05,722
SHORT TERM PAIN
FOR LONG TERM GAIN.

125
00:05:05,806 --> 00:05:08,392
FINE,
CHASE YOUR LONG-TERM GAIN,

126
00:05:08,475 --> 00:05:09,977

SAV:
WELL, I KNOW IT'S SOLITAIRE,

132
00:05:28,871 --> 00:05:31,707
BUT... WHAT KIND OF SOLITAIRE?

133
00:05:33,709 --> 00:05:35,085
IF YOU'RE TRYING

134
00:05:35,169 --> 00:05:36,253
INTO SEEING THAT CONCERT,

135
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:38,005
YOU'LL HAVE TO TALK
TO YOUR FATHER.

136
00:05:38,088 --> 00:05:40,966
MR. BHANDARI:
TALK TO ME ABOUT WHAT?

137
00:05:41,049 --> 00:05:44,469

WE WANTED
TO SEE THIS, DEAR!

141
00:05:52,978 --> 00:05:54,438
MR. BHANDARI:

142
00:05:54,521 --> 00:05:56,190
WHAT CLEVER RUSE IS THIS?

143
00:05:56,273 --> 00:05:57,900
YOU WANT US OUT OF THE HOUSE?

144
00:05:57,983 --> 00:05:59,735
NO, NO, NO.
IT'S AN APOLOGY.

145
00:05:59,818 --> 00:06:01,403
I WAS ACTING LIKE A JERK.

146
00:06:01,486 --> 00:06:03,906
ARE THERE GIRLS
COMING OVER TONIGHT?

147
00:06:03,989 --> 00:06:05,866
LOOK, I DON'T THINK
WE CAN ACCEPT THESE.

148
00:06:05,949 --> 00:06:08,118
SAV'S BEING SINCERE.
HE'S SORRY.

149
00:06:08,202 --> 00:06:10,787
YEAH, SO SORRY.
AND, AND NO ONE'S COMING OVER;

150
00:06:10,871 --> 00:06:13,790
I'VE GOT TOO MUCH HOMEWORK
ANYWAYS.

151
00:06:16,001 --> 00:06:17,711
OKAY.

152
00:06:17,794 --> 00:06:18,754
WE'LL GO.

153
00:06:18,837 --> 00:06:23,050
BUT ONLY BECAUSE THAT
TAPAS BANERJEE IS SUCH A CARD.

154
00:06:23,133 --> 00:06:25,385
I CAN WEAR
ONE OF MY NEW SHIRTS!

155
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:28,805
THANK YOU, SAV.
WHAT A GENEROUS GESTURE.

156
00:06:28,889 --> 00:06:31,350
I KNOW YOU AND YOUR FATHER

157
00:06:31,433 --> 00:06:35,103

THE SPACE

163

AND WE PUT THE WHEELS RIGHT BACK
WHERE THE CHALK IS.

164
00:06:56,583 --> 00:06:58,168
AND WE USE THESE PHOTOS
TO KEEP THE INTERIOR

165
00:06:58,252 --> 00:06:59,461

166
00:06:59,545 --> 00:07:01,964
YEAH, NO.
THE, THE PLAN IS SOUND.

167
00:07:02,047 --> 00:07:04,258

00:07:04,341 --> 00:07:05,259
THINKING ABOUT MY MOM.

169
00:07:05,342 --> 00:07:06,343
AWW... SWEET.

170
00:07:07,344 --> 00:07:08,762
VERY FUNNY.

171
00:07:08,846 --> 00:07:10,013

"BUDDY, WE TRUST YOU."

173
00:07:13,225 --> 00:07:14,184
WELL,
THEY SHOULD TRUST YOU.

174
00:07:14,268 --> 00:07:16,061

00:14:24,948 --> 00:14:26,742
I'M WAITING
FOR A SPEEDING TICKET

349
00:14:26,825 --> 00:14:28,160
FOR WHICH MY PARENTS
ARE GONNA KILL ME!

350
00:14:30,996 --> 00:14:32,372

352
00:14:39,087 --> 00:14:41,173
HEY.

353
00:14:41,256 --> 00:14:43,383
UH, LISTEN, I AM...
I'M REALLY SORRY.

354
00:14:43,467 --> 00:14:44,801
I'M NEVER GONNA SPEED AGAIN,

355
00:14:44,885 --> 00:14:46,845
UH, BUT WE...
WE NEED TO GET HOME.

356
00:14:46,929 --> 00:14:48,889
OFFICER TURNER:
STEP OUT OF THE CAR, PLEASE.

357
00:14:48,972 --> 00:14:49,973
THIS TRUCK'S BEEN
REPORTED STOLEN.

358
00:14:56,230 --> 00:14:57,397
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE
MY FRIEND!

HOLLY J:
FIONA, ARE YOU HOME?

362
00:15:05,364 --> 00:15:07,115
HEY, UH, I KNOW YOU SAID
YOU DIDN'T WANNA WORK TOGETHER,

363
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:08,867
I JUST THOUGHT THAT...

364
00:15:10,035 --> 00:15:11,703
WHOA! DID I MISS
A TROPICAL STORM WARNING

365
00:15:11,787 --> 00:15:13,163
OR SOMETHING?

366
00:15:13,247 --> 00:15:14,164
PORCELINA:
(OINKING)

367
00:15:14,248 --> 00:15:17,876

JUST PLAYING.

(SIGHS HEAVILY)

369
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:24,091
THAT PIG IS A MENACE.

370
00:15:24,174 --> 00:15:26,426
HEY, WE'LL CLEAN IT UP.
IT'S OKAY.

371
00:15:26,510 --> 00:15:28,846
YEAH, UNTIL YOU GET
BUSY AGAIN!

372
00:15:28,929 --> 00:15:30,389
I'M SORRY.

373
00:15:30,472 --> 00:15:31,640
I SHOULD'VE BEEN HERE
FOR YOU,

374
00:15:31,723 --> 00:15:34,393
AND I WILL CLEAR
MY SCHEDULE.

375
00:15:34,476 --> 00:15:35,394
REALLY?

376
00:15:35,477 --> 00:15:36,436
AND ONCE WE'RE DONE
CLEANING UP,

377
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:37,771
WE CAN RETURN PORCELINA

378
00:15:37,855 --> 00:15:40,649
AND USE THE MONEY TO GO
SHOPPING OR SOMETHING.

379
00:15:40,732 --> 00:15:42,109
MY TREAT!

380
00:15:42,192 --> 00:15:44,862
FIONA, DON'T YOU REALIZE
WHAT YOU'RE DOING?

381
00:15:44,945 --> 00:15:48,115
YOU'RE PAYING ME
TO HANG OUT WITH YOU.

382
00:15:48,198 --> 00:15:52,160
(SIGHS) DR. SANDLER WAS RIGHT.
I CAN'T BE ALONE.

383
00:15:52,244 --> 00:15:53,829
YEAH, YOU REALIZE
I'M NOT JUST YOU'RE FRIEND

384
00:15:53,912 --> 00:15:56,665
BECAUSE OF THE...
THE MONEY, RIGHT?

385
00:15:56,748 --> 00:15:57,666
YEAH, I KNOW,

386
00:15:57,749 --> 00:15:59,042
BUT IT DOESN'T MEAN
YOU HAVE TO BE HERE

387
00:15:59,126 --> 00:16:01,170
ALL THE TIME EITHER.

388
00:16:01,253 --> 00:16:02,671
I NEED TO LEARN
TO BE BY MYSELF

389
00:16:02,754 --> 00:16:05,674
AND TO OPEN UP TO DR. SANDLER
A LITTLE MORE.

390
00:16:05,757 --> 00:16:07,342
SO, IF YOU'RE TOO BUSY,
GO.

391
00:16:07,426 --> 00:16:09,011
RUN FREE.
I'LL BE OKAY.

WELL, HEY,
SOMEBODY'S GOTTA STAY

394
00:16:11,597 --> 00:16:13,432
AND HELP YOU CATCH THAT PIG,
RIGHT?

395
00:16:13,515 --> 00:16:15,350
(PORCELINA SQUEALS)
(SIGHS) YEAH.

398
00:16:23,692 --> 00:16:25,485

399
00:16:25,569 --> 00:16:28,113
THANKS FOR GETTING
THESE FOR ME.

400
00:16:28,197 --> 00:16:29,698
DON'T LAUGH.

401
00:16:30,782 --> 00:16:32,326
MY PANTS LOOK
KINDA HOT ON YOU.

402
00:16:32,409 --> 00:16:35,329
KC!
I'M IN CRISIS MODE HERE!

403
00:16:35,829 --> 00:16:37,581
I STILL DON'T GET
WHAT HAPPENED.

404
00:16:37,664 --> 00:16:40,667
IT WAS DIET-TYPE PILLS
WITH GROSS SIDE EFFECTS

405
00:16:40,751 --> 00:16:42,377
THAT HAPPENED TO ME,

406
00:16:42,461 --> 00:16:45,547
IN FRONT OF THE ENTIRE
POWER SQUAD.

407
00:16:45,631 --> 00:16:47,549
WHY WERE YOU
TAKING PILLS?

408
00:16:47,633 --> 00:16:49,551
I WANTED TO FIT MY UNIFORM
FOR THE CALENDAR.

409
00:16:49,635 --> 00:16:52,387
I DIDN'T WANT TO BE
FAT ANYMORE.

410
00:16:52,471 --> 00:16:54,014
WHO THINKS YOU'RE FAT?

411
00:16:54,097 --> 00:16:57,184
ME. THE GIRLS.
EVERYONE. EVEN YOU.

412
00:16:57,267 --> 00:16:58,894
YOU KEEP JOKING
ABOUT IT.

413
00:16:58,977 --> 00:16:59,978
ME?

414
00:17:01,647 --> 00:17:03,232
I LOVE YOUR BODY.

415
00:17:03,315 --> 00:17:05,609
YOU HAVE TO SAY THAT.

416
00:17:06,568 --> 00:17:07,569
I LOVE YOUR FINGERS.

417
00:17:09,863 --> 00:17:12,824
YOUR PALMS.
I LOVE YOUR ARMS.

418
00:17:15,536 --> 00:17:18,830
YOUR SEXY SHOULDERS,
YOUR NECK...

MR. BHANDARI:
MAKING US TAKE TAXIS
ALL OVER CREATION

420
00:17:23,794 --> 00:17:25,546
TO PICK YOU UP FROM THE POLICE?

421
00:17:25,629 --> 00:17:28,549
THEN I HAD TO SPEND ONE HOUR
TO CLEAN UP YOUR MESS!

422
00:17:28,632 --> 00:17:31,093
OBVIOUSLY, YOU'RE GROUNDED.

423
00:17:31,176 --> 00:17:33,554
TWO MONTHS
AND YOU'LL PAY THE FINE.

424
00:17:33,637 --> 00:17:36,139
BUT... WHAT WERE YOU THINKING?

425
00:17:38,225 --> 00:17:39,726
I WASN'T, I GUESS.

426
00:17:41,353 --> 00:17:43,939
I JUST THOUGHT
I DESERVED TO HAVE SOME FUN.

427
00:17:44,022 --> 00:17:46,108
DID WE DESERVE TO COME OUT
OF THAT THEATRE

428
00:17:46,191 --> 00:17:47,317
TO AN EMPTY PARKING SPACE,

429
00:17:47,401 --> 00:17:50,320
THINKING MY BRAND NEW TRUCK
HAD BEEN STOLEN?

430
00:17:50,404 --> 00:17:51,572
NO, SIR.

431
00:17:51,655 --> 00:17:54,116
DID OTHER MOTORISTS DESERVE
TO HAVE THEIR LIVES RISKED

432
00:17:54,199 --> 00:17:56,285
SO THAT YOU COULD SPEED HOME
FROM A CONCERT

433
00:17:56,368 --> 00:17:59,621
YOU WERE NOT EVEN ALLOWED
TO GO TO?

434
00:17:59,705 --> 00:18:01,206
NO, SIR.

435
00:18:01,290 --> 00:18:03,542
THEN WHY DID YOU DO THIS?

436
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:11,842
BECAUSE YOU MAKE MY LIFE
SO HARD.

437
00:18:16,638 --> 00:18:18,974
IS IT HARD TO LIVE
IN A NICE HOUSE,

438
00:18:19,057 --> 00:18:20,767
WITH NOTHING BUT OPPORTUNITY?

439
00:18:20,851 --> 00:18:22,186
NO, BUT...

440
00:18:23,395 --> 00:18:25,647
YOU HAVE THIS, LIKE,
THIS PERFECT IMAGE OF ME.

441
00:18:25,731 --> 00:18:27,482
WE ARE NOT ASKING YOU
TO BE PERFECT!

442
00:18:27,566 --> 00:18:30,444
YEAH,
NOT IN THAT MANY WORDS!

443
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:33,572
BUT I HAVE TO SACRIFICE
ALL THESE THINGS -

444
00:18:33,655 --> 00:18:34,656
THE LOVE OF MY LIFE,

445
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:38,410
MUSIC, FRIENDS -

446
00:18:40,037 --> 00:18:40,954
JUST TO LIVE UP

447
00:18:41,038 --> 00:18:43,498
TO YOUR UNREALISTIC
EXPECTATIONS!

448
00:18:43,582 --> 00:18:46,251
LOOK, I'M SORRY.
SOMETIMES I MESS UP.

449
00:18:50,714 --> 00:18:53,175
BUT I WILL EARN
YOUR TRUST AGAIN.

450
00:18:53,258 --> 00:18:54,259
I HOPE SO.

451
00:18:55,469 --> 00:18:57,846
BECAUSE DEEP DOWN,

452
00:18:57,930 --> 00:19:00,015
I KNOW YOU'RE A GOOD PERSON.

453
00:19:02,184 --> 00:19:04,728
VERY DEEP DOWN.

454
00:19:17,157 --> 00:19:20,494
ALLI:
THE PARENTALS WENT NUCLEAR
ON MY BROTHER LAST NIGHT.

455
00:19:20,577 --> 00:19:23,580
I THINK I COULD GET CAUGHT
WITH DREW IN MY ROOM, NAKED,

456
00:19:23,664 --> 00:19:25,165
AND STILL BE
THE GOOD KID!

457
00:19:25,249 --> 00:19:26,583
(CHUCKLES)

458
00:19:27,292 --> 00:19:28,210
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

459
00:19:28,293 --> 00:19:30,546
EATING NORMAL FOOD
AND NOT WORRYING ABOUT IT!

460
00:19:30,629 --> 00:19:33,674
YOU CALL DIPPING YOUR BANANA
IN RANCH DRESSING NORMAL?

461
00:19:33,757 --> 00:19:36,093
IT'S WHAT I FELT LIKE.

462
00:19:38,136 --> 00:19:39,680
SURE YOU DON'T WANNA
EAT WITH THEM?

463
00:19:39,763 --> 00:19:40,681
NO.

464
00:19:40,764 --> 00:19:42,516
OH, THAT'S RIGHT.

465
00:19:42,599 --> 00:19:44,726
I HEARD ABOUT
YOUR PYRAMID INCIDENT.

466
00:19:44,810 --> 00:19:46,520
JEEZ,
DOES EVERYONE KNOW?

467
00:19:46,603 --> 00:19:49,690
NOT EVERYONE.
WELL, PROBABLY NOT.

468
00:19:50,691 --> 00:19:52,818
I GUESS IT WAS
THE DIET PILLS?

469
00:19:52,901 --> 00:19:55,863
COME ON!
YOU HEARD THAT TOO?

470
00:19:55,946 --> 00:19:59,575
SO YOU REALLY HAD
THE, UM, SIDE EFFECTS?

471
00:19:59,658 --> 00:20:00,576
EVEN...?

472
00:20:00,659 --> 00:20:01,869
ANAL LEAKAGE?

473
00:20:01,952 --> 00:20:04,496
IF YOUR BODY CAN'T ABSORB FAT,
IT HAS TO GO SOMEWHERE.

474
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:06,373
THEY'RE GONNA CALL ME "SQUIRT"
FOR THE NEXT TWO MONTHS!

475
00:20:06,456 --> 00:20:09,543
OKAY! LA-LA-LA-LA!
I'M EATING.

476
00:20:09,626 --> 00:20:10,711
ON THE BRIGHT SIDE,

477
00:20:10,794 --> 00:20:12,379
I FOUND ANOTHER WAY
TO FIT INTO MY UNIFORM

478
00:20:12,462 --> 00:20:13,547
FOR THE SHOOT NEXT WEEK.

479
00:20:13,630 --> 00:20:14,548
JENNA, COME ON.
DIETS ARE SCARY.

480
00:20:14,631 --> 00:20:17,259
I ASKED ANYA TO ORDER ME
A LARGER SIZE.

481
00:20:17,342 --> 00:20:18,635
REALLY?

482
00:20:18,719 --> 00:20:21,263
WOW, JENNA.
YOU'RE A REAL TRAILBLAZER.

483
00:20:21,346 --> 00:20:23,974
YES, I AM.
AND SPEAKING OF...

484
00:20:24,057 --> 00:20:25,601
YOU SURE YOU DON'T WANNA
TRY SOME?

485
00:20:25,684 --> 00:20:27,561

486
00:20:27,644 --> 00:20:28,812
