THAT'S...GREAT.

230
00:08:12,508 --> 00:08:13,676
UH, DON'T YOU WANT

HEY, DON'T LOOK AT ME.

240
00:08:30,693 --> 00:08:32,987
I DON'T NEED MORE EYES ON ME
THAN NECESSARY.

241
00:08:32,987 --> 00:08:35,656
I DON'T LIKE ATTENTION,
SO, UM...

242
00:08:35,656 --> 00:08:36,741

LIKE A MILLION TIMES.

BUT DON'T WORRY,
I WON'T MENTION HIM AGAIN.

261

DID WAS WRONG.

262

THAT IS CALLING YOU?

350
00:12:43,029 --> 00:12:45,031
HE WILL ONLY WANT
TO BE TAKING ADVANTAGE!

351
00:12:45,031 --> 00:12:46,032
(LAUGHS)

352
00:12:46,032 --> 00:12:48,368
SO, DOES THIS MEAN
I'M FORGIVEN?

353
00:12:48,368 --> 00:12:50,703
LET'S SAY 
YOU'RE ON PROBATION.

354
00:12:50,703 --> 00:12:52,622
BUT IF I CATCH YOU FLIRTING
WITH ANOTHER GIRL,

355
00:12:52,622 --> 00:12:55,041
EVEN A LITTLE-
AND RISK LOSING YOU
AGAIN?

356
00:12:55,041 --> 00:12:56,918
NEVER.

357
00:12:56,918 --> 00:12:58,127
SO DOES THAT GUY
ON PROBATION

358
00:12:58,127 --> 00:12:59,670
GET TO TAKE
A GIRLFRIEND OUT TONIGHT?

359
00:12:59,670 --> 00:13:03,633
MAYBE WE CAN CATCH A MOVIE
AFTER THAT SELF-ESTEEM SEMINAR.

360
00:13:03,633 --> 00:13:05,009
WHAT SELF-ESTEEM SEMINAR?

361
00:13:05,009 --> 00:13:06,469
YOU KNOW,
THE ONE FOR ALL THE KIDS

362
00:13:06,469 --> 00:13:08,971
ASSOCIATED WITH "BOILER-GATE"?

363
00:13:08,971 --> 00:13:11,057
OH, COME ON, DON'T TELL ME
YOU ESCAPED THE LIST!

364
00:13:11,057 --> 00:13:14,602
BIANCA:
ACTUALLY, THE EVENT'S
FOR LADIES ONLY.

365
00:13:14,602 --> 00:13:16,562
NICE TO SEE YOU TWO
PATCHED THINGS UP.

366
00:13:16,562 --> 00:13:17,647
MUST BE TRUE LOVE.

367
00:13:18,648 --> 00:13:20,483
HMPH!
ALLI, DON'T LET HER
GET TO YOU!

368
00:13:22,527 --> 00:13:25,154
SHE'S DONE ENOUGH TO US.

369
00:13:25,154 --> 00:13:26,906
HOLLY J: (ON PA)
RUNNING OUT OF CLEAN
GOLF SHIRTS?

370
00:13:26,906 --> 00:13:28,658
IT'S NOT TOO LATE
TO BUY EXTRAS!

371
00:13:28,658 --> 00:13:32,412
PICK THEM UP
IN THE ADMIN. OFFICE.

372
00:13:32,412 --> 00:13:35,081
DO YOU WANT TO BORROW
MY HOODIE?
OH! IT SAYS DEGRASSI,
RIGHT?

373
00:13:35,081 --> 00:13:36,457
YEAH, CLOSE ENOUGH
TO DRESS CODE.

374
00:13:36,457 --> 00:13:38,626
OH, THANKS.
I'M GETTING WAY BIGGER.

375
00:13:38,626 --> 00:13:39,627
YOU HID IT OKAY
BEHIND YOUR GUITAR

376
00:13:39,627 --> 00:13:41,421
ON TV LAST NIGHT.

377
00:13:41,421 --> 00:13:43,047
YOU SAW THE SHOW?

378
00:13:43,047 --> 00:13:44,340
THAT'S NICE.

379
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:45,675
MY MOM WATCHES.

380
00:13:46,676 --> 00:13:48,010
SHE'S PROUD OF YOU.

381
00:13:48,010 --> 00:13:51,180
(LAUGHS UNEASILY)
'TIL SHE FINDS OUT I'M PREGNANT.

382
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:53,057
YEAH.

383
00:13:53,057 --> 00:13:54,767
IT'S GETTING HARDER 
TO KEEP IT A SECRET,

384
00:13:54,767 --> 00:13:56,310
AS YOU CAN SEE.

385
00:13:56,310 --> 00:13:58,312
JUST LET ME TELL MY MOM FIRST,
OKAY?

386
00:13:58,312 --> 00:14:01,482
WELL, WERE YOU PLANNING ON IT
THIS YEAR?

387
00:14:01,482 --> 00:14:02,859
I'LL DO IT WHEN I DO IT.

388
00:14:02,859 --> 00:14:05,737
YOU'RE RUNNING OUT OF TIME,

390
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:10,158

SO BOYS DON'T HAVE TO GO
TO THE SELF-ESTEEM SEMINAR?

391
00:14:10,158 --> 00:14:11,868
ALLI:
NO, IT'S JUST FOR STUPID GIRLS
LIKE BIANCA,

392
00:14:11,868 --> 00:14:12,869
WHO DON'T LIKE THEMSELVES!

393
00:14:12,869 --> 00:14:14,120
THAT IS SUCH
A DOUBLE STANDARD!

394
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:15,121
TELL ME ABOUT IT!

395
00:14:15,121 --> 00:14:16,664
HOW COULD SIMPSON LUMP ME 
INTO THAT GROUP OF SKANKS,

396
00:14:16,664 --> 00:14:18,791
WHEN I DIDN'T EVEN
DO ANYTHING?

397
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:21,127
IT DOESN'T BOTHER YOU
THAT BOYS DON'T HAVE TO GO?

398
00:14:21,127 --> 00:14:22,128
YEAH, SURE, WHATEVER.

399
00:14:22,128 --> 00:14:23,129
MAYBE I'LL JUST SKIP
THE SEMINAR.

400
00:14:23,129 --> 00:14:25,131
I MEAN,
I DON'T EVEN BELONG THERE!

401
00:14:25,131 --> 00:14:27,300
NO, THAT'LL ONLY MAKE
THINGS WORSE.

402
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:30,219
JUST GO. IT'S THE PATH
OF LEAST RESISTANCE.

403
00:14:30,219 --> 00:14:32,555
AND IN A WEEK,
THIS ALL BLOWS OVER.

404

APPARENTLY I HAVE
BOILER ROOM BHANDARI TO THANK

405
00:14:34,849 --> 00:14:38,061
FOR MY HIDEOUS
NOT-MY-COLOUR SHIRT.

406
00:14:39,062 --> 00:14:41,147

409
00:14:45,068 --> 00:14:47,403
SO, TALK TO ME 
ABOUT THE SHOW!

410
00:14:47,403 --> 00:14:49,489
UH, BOTTOM TWO,
REMEMBER?

411
00:14:49,489 --> 00:14:50,990
BUT YOU'RE NOT OUT YET,

412
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:53,117
YOU WANT TO WIN,
DON'T YOU?

413
00:14:53,117 --> 00:14:54,577
OF COURSE!

THE ATTITUDE.

416
00:14:58,748 --> 00:15:00,416
WHERE'S SUNNY JENNA?

417
00:15:00,416 --> 00:15:02,335
SHE'S THE ONE 
WHO ALMOST GOT VOTED OUT!

418
00:15:02,335 --> 00:15:04,003
I WAS UP ALL NIGHT 
PRACTICING MY SONG,

419
00:15:04,003 --> 00:15:06,339
BUT IT'S NOT GOOD ENOUGH!

420

HONESTLY, I TOTALLY WANT YOU
TO WIN,

421

A LITTLE BLAND.

426
00:15:15,890 --> 00:15:17,517
YOU MUST HAVE SOME SORT
OF DRAMA

427
00:15:17,517 --> 00:15:19,894
TO GET PEOPLE INTERESTED.

428
00:15:19,894 --> 00:15:22,021

WHY DID YOU GUYS
BREAK UP AGAIN?

542
00:19:56,379 --> 00:19:57,964
YOU KNOW, STUFF.

543
00:19:57,964 --> 00:19:59,424
OH RIGHT, STUFF.

544
00:19:59,424 --> 00:20:01,259
(TEASINGLY) YES.
STUFF CAN REALLY...

545
00:20:01,259 --> 00:20:02,885
CAUSE PROBLEMS.

546
00:20:03,886 --> 00:20:04,887
OKAY, I GET IT.

547

I'M YOUR MOM,
NOT YOUR BUD.

00:20:06,431 --> 00:20:09,976
YOU DON'T HAVE
TO TELL ME.

549

THERE WAS JUST THIS...
THIS SITUATION

550
00:20:13,771 --> 00:20:15,356

ON HOW TO HANDLE IT.
