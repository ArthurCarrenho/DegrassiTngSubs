DREW:
OKAY, IF YOU WERE TO WRITE

2
00:00:05,297 --> 00:00:06,423
WHERE WOULD YOU START?

3
00:00:06,507 --> 00:00:08,342
UH, WHEN WAS IT?

4
00:00:10,135 --> 00:00:12,221
THE VICTORIAN ERA?

5
00:00:12,304 --> 00:00:13,764
I HAVE NO IDEA.

6
00:00:13,847 --> 00:00:15,599
MAYBE YOU SHOULD HAVE SAID
THE ESSAY ALLI WROTE FOR YOU

7
00:00:15,682 --> 00:00:16,934
WAS YOUR OWN.

8
00:00:17,017 --> 00:00:18,894
I'M TRYING TO FORGET
ABOUT THAT.

9
00:00:18,977 --> 00:00:20,437
SO I'M GUESSING
YOU TWO ARE OVER?

10
00:00:20,521 --> 00:00:22,314
I DON'T APPRECIATE
BEING CALLED STUPID.

11
00:00:22,397 --> 00:00:24,149
(SCHOOL BELL RINGS)

12
00:00:24,233 --> 00:00:26,527
I'M A NEW GUY
AT A NEW SCHOOL.

13
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:28,654
I DON'T SEE WHY
I SHOULD BE TIED DOWN.

14
00:00:28,737 --> 00:00:30,822
I SUCK AT SCHOOLWORK,
BUT I RULE AT GIRLS.

15
00:00:30,906 --> 00:00:31,823
GIRL:

16
00:00:31,907 --> 00:00:33,408

21
00:00:40,332 --> 00:00:41,250

00:00:41,333 --> 00:00:42,376

SO WITH ALL YOUR OPTIONS,
WHO'RE YOU GONNA PICK?

25
00:00:46,922 --> 00:00:47,923
I DON'T KNOW.

WHERE SHOULD I LOOK?

45
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:52,738
THE PET STORE?

46
00:01:52,821 --> 00:01:56,575
NO, SERIOUSLY, MAN.
HELP ME NAVIGATE.

47
00:01:56,658 --> 00:01:58,702
AN ARTSY GIRL
COULD BE COOL.

48
00:01:58,785 --> 00:02:00,704
MIGHT INVOLVE
NUDE PORTRAITURE?

49
00:02:00,787 --> 00:02:02,122

50
00:02:02,206 --> 00:02:03,916
AH, WHAT ABOUT

51
00:02:03,999 --> 00:02:05,792

IF YOU WANT DRAMA 24/7.

52
00:02:05,876 --> 00:02:06,960
OH.

53
00:02:07,044 --> 00:02:07,961
OOH.

54
00:02:08,045 --> 00:02:09,796
CAN'T GO WRONG
WITH A CHEERLEADER.

55
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:10,839
CUTE, PEPPY,

56
00:02:10,923 --> 00:02:13,509
AND THEY CAN DO NO WRONG
IN THOSE SKIRTS.

57
00:02:13,592 --> 00:02:14,718
(CHUCKLES)

58
00:02:14,801 --> 00:02:17,346
I HEAR MARISOL'S

59
00:02:17,429 --> 00:02:18,889
OH YEAH?

60
00:02:18,972 --> 00:02:19,973
HMM...

61
00:02:22,476 --> 00:02:23,936
HEY, MARISOL,

62
00:02:24,019 --> 00:02:25,729
AS A POWER SQUADDER
AND A HOTTIE,

63
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:28,774
I'M CONCERNED ABOUT
YOUR CURRENT STATUS AS SINGLE.

64
00:02:28,857 --> 00:02:30,651
OH, THE RIGHT GUY
HASN'T COME ALONG, I GUESS.

65
00:02:30,734 --> 00:02:32,361
OH, WHAT'S TAKING HIM
SO LONG?

66
00:02:32,444 --> 00:02:33,570
I DON'T KNOW.

67
00:02:33,654 --> 00:02:35,656
I COULDN'T BE MORE AVAILABLE
RIGHT NOW.

68
00:02:35,739 --> 00:02:38,075
WELL, SOMEBODY HAS
TO ASK YOU OUT.

69
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:39,868
IT'D BE A SIN NOT TO.

70
00:02:39,952 --> 00:02:41,370
YEAH, BUT WHO?

71
00:02:41,453 --> 00:02:42,579
I HEARD YOU'RE WITH ALLI.

72
00:02:42,663 --> 00:02:45,916
I DON'T SEE HER AROUND,
DO YOU?

73
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:47,501
NO.

74
00:02:47,584 --> 00:02:49,336
WELL THEN,
WHAT DO YOU SAY?

75
00:02:55,509 --> 00:02:56,426
VITE! VITE!

76
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:57,594
WE CAN'T BE EN RETARD
FOR FRENCH AGAIN.

77
00:02:57,678 --> 00:02:59,263
HEELS!
WHAT'S THE RUSH?

78
00:02:59,346 --> 00:03:00,848
SAV:
HEY, HOT STUFF!

79
00:03:00,931 --> 00:03:02,391
HOLLY J:
HEY.

80
00:03:02,474 --> 00:03:04,101
(LAUGHING)
UM, HOT STUFF?

81
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:05,102
WHAT AM I MISSING HERE?

82
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:08,021
MILD FLIRTATION.
NOTHING SERIOUS.

83
00:03:08,105 --> 00:03:09,940
I EXPECTED YOU TO ACT WEIRD
POST BREAK-UP,

84
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:11,191
BUT SAV?

85
00:03:12,109 --> 00:03:14,278
WHAT'S SO WRONG
WITH SAV?

86
00:03:14,361 --> 00:03:15,445
YOU LIKE HIM!

87
00:03:15,529 --> 00:03:16,530
NO!

88
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:19,867
NO. OF COURSE NOT.

89
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:22,119
HMM, WHAT WOULD
DECLAN SAY?

90
00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:23,161
FIONA.

91
00:03:23,245 --> 00:03:25,622
BUT YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE
MY SISTER-IN-LAW SOME DAY.

92
00:03:25,706 --> 00:03:28,083
LOOK, I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S
GONNA HAPPEN IN THE FUTURE,

93
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:30,878
BUT I DO KNOW THAT THE THOUGHT
OF SAV AND I TOGETHER IS...

94
00:03:30,961 --> 00:03:32,045
WRONG.

95
00:03:32,129 --> 00:03:33,630
SO VERY...

96
00:03:33,714 --> 00:03:36,049
RIGHT.
AND SO, SO HOT.

97
00:03:36,717 --> 00:03:38,302
SO YOU KISSED?!

98
00:03:38,385 --> 00:03:41,430
AND HER LIPS WEREN'T ALL LIKE
TIGHT AND ANGRY AND HARD?

99
00:03:41,513 --> 00:03:43,515
NO, I DON'T THINK SO.

100
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:44,892
MAYBE SHE WAS A BIT
SURPRISED.

101
00:03:44,975 --> 00:03:45,893
AND SHE DIDN'T SLAP YOU?

102
00:03:45,976 --> 00:03:47,978
NO.
THAT'S GOOD, RIGHT?

103
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:50,063
DUDE, SHE WAS LIKE BEST FRIENDS
WITH YOUR EX GIRLFRIEND.

104
00:03:50,147 --> 00:03:51,982
NO, MAN,
ANYA DOESN'T NEED TO KNOW.

105
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:52,983
FUN SECRET TIMES

106
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:55,152
IN THE STUDENT COUNCIL ROOM
AWAIT.

107
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:56,653
OKAY, MR. COMMITMENT,

108
00:03:56,737 --> 00:03:58,655
DON'T GO BUYING
ANY ENGAGEMENT RINGS JUST YET.

109
00:03:58,739 --> 00:03:59,656
OF COURSE NOT.

110
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:01,909
NOT UNTIL I'M FINISHED
MY LUNCH.

111
00:04:03,619 --> 00:04:05,245
DAVE:
HEY, CON-MAN.

112
00:04:05,871 --> 00:04:07,289
SO, I WAS THINKING,
IT'S COOL THAT YOU HAVE A GIRL,

113
00:04:07,372 --> 00:04:09,499
EVEN IF SHE ONLY EXISTS
IN AN ONLINE RPG.

114
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:11,210
THANK YOU.
I APPRECIATE YOUR APPROVAL.

115
00:04:11,293 --> 00:04:13,962
BUT KNOW WHAT'S EVEN BETTER
THAN A VIRTUAL GIRLFRIEND?

116
00:04:14,046 --> 00:04:15,172
A REAL ONE.

117
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:17,132
THAT'S NOT NECESSARILY
ACCURATE.

118
00:04:17,216 --> 00:04:18,133
OKAY, COME ON,

119
00:04:18,217 --> 00:04:19,134
CAN YOU MAKE OUT
WITH AN AVATAR?

120
00:04:19,218 --> 00:04:20,177
THAT'S NOT IMPORTANT TO US.

121
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:22,012
CAN SHE BUY YOU
COOL GIFTS?

122
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:23,013
HER GREATEST GIFT TO ME

123
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:24,264
IS HER ADVANCED
MAGIC SKILL LEVEL.

124
00:04:24,348 --> 00:04:25,265
OKAY, OKAY,

125
00:04:25,349 --> 00:04:27,935
SO CAN YOU TAKE HER
TO THE DANCE AS A DATE?

126
00:04:28,018 --> 00:04:29,102
DIDN'T THINK SO.

127
00:04:29,186 --> 00:04:31,522
CONNOR:
BUT WE AREN'T SUPPOSED TO MEET
STRANGERS OFF THE INTERNET.

128
00:04:31,605 --> 00:04:33,398
OKAY, SO ME AND WES
WILL COME CHECK IT OUT

129
00:04:33,482 --> 00:04:34,775
AND MAKE SURE IT'S SAFE.

130
00:04:34,858 --> 00:04:37,819
IN PUBLIC,
SO NO WORRIES, HUH?

131
00:04:37,903 --> 00:04:38,820
OKAY, YEAH.

132
00:04:38,904 --> 00:04:39,821
SO, DO YOU JUST WANT ME
TO GO ON A DATE

133
00:04:39,905 --> 00:04:41,031
SO YOU KNOW WHAT
IT'S LIKE?

134
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:42,115
(SNORTED LAUGH)

135
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:45,202
BOOM! DISSED!
CONNOR!

136
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:46,286
(LAUGHING)

137
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:49,289
SHEESH.

138
00:04:50,457 --> 00:04:52,042
JENNA:
YOU USUALLY FINISH
ALL THE CHEESE CURDS

139
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:53,710
BEFORE I CAN GET ONE.

140
00:04:53,794 --> 00:04:55,462
YOU THINKING ABOUT DREW?

141
00:04:55,546 --> 00:04:58,715
I ADMIT DOING HIS ESSAY
WAS STUPID, BUT...

142
00:04:58,799 --> 00:05:01,468
I SAW A SIDE OF HIM
AND IT WAS REALLY MEAN.

143
00:05:01,552 --> 00:05:03,262
SO, ARE YOU OVER HIM?

144
00:05:03,345 --> 00:05:04,346
(SIGHING)

145
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:07,641
MARISOL:
I MEAN I WAS SO NERVOUS...

146
00:05:07,724 --> 00:05:10,644
I'M PRETTY SURE
HE'S OVER ME.

147
00:05:12,187 --> 00:05:13,105
MARISOL:
I MEAN, LIKE YOU'RE

148
00:05:13,188 --> 00:05:14,857
AND I'M CHEERLEADER SO...

149
00:05:16,483 --> 00:05:17,818
CAN WE GO?

150
00:05:18,819 --> 00:05:19,736
MARISOL:
LIKE I SAID,

151
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:21,321
ALL THE GIRLS THINK
YOU'RE THE HOTTEST GUY

152
00:05:21,405 --> 00:05:22,322
ON THE TEAM.

153
00:05:22,406 --> 00:05:24,241
THEN KC,
THEN RILEY,

154
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:26,577
THEN ZANE, THEN OWEN.

155
00:05:28,078 --> 00:05:30,247
GLAD TO HEAR
I'M ON TOP.

156
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:31,456
HI.
WANNA ORDER SOMETHING?

157
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:32,749

159
00:05:33,834 --> 00:05:34,918
A LARGE ICE TEA FOR ME.

160
00:05:35,002 --> 00:05:36,545

161
00:05:36,628 --> 00:05:37,754
(GIGGLING)
I LOVE ICE TEA.

162
00:05:37,838 --> 00:05:38,755

163
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:40,257
HEY, HAVE YOU HEARD

164
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:42,301
OH MY GOD,

175
00:06:00,611 --> 00:06:02,404
YES, THAT'S WHAT I WANT.

176
00:06:02,487 --> 00:06:04,406
OKAY, YOU'RE THE BOSS.

177
00:06:04,489 --> 00:06:05,365
AND FOR THE LADY?
