IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU HAD
A BAD DAY.

356
00:13:32,521 --> 00:13:34,022
THEY TOOK ALL MY STUFF.

357
00:13:34,106 --> 00:13:35,691
IT'S NOT FAIR,
THERE'S A ROUTINE,

358
00:13:35,774 --> 00:13:37,234

CHANGE SOMETHING LIKE THAT

360
00:13:38,819 --> 00:13:40,571

386
00:14:43,842 --> 00:14:46,720
THE PRENATAL SCREENING
SHOWS THE BABY'S HEALTHY.

387
00:14:46,803 --> 00:14:49,556
ALL THE PARTS
ARE IN THE RIGHT PLACE.

388
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:50,933
TAKE A LOOK.

389
00:14:51,016 --> 00:14:52,226
ARE YOU THE BABY'S FATHER?

390
00:14:52,309 --> 00:14:54,186

OH, NO,
I'M HER BROTHER.

391
00:14:54,269 --> 00:14:55,604

SURE.

YOU'RE FURTHER ALONG
THAN YOU THOUGHT.

DID YOU NOTICE YOU WERE
MISSING YOUR PERIODS?

398
00:15:07,074 --> 00:15:10,077
HAVE ANY OF THE OTHER
SYMPTOMS?

399
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:10,994
YEAH.

400
00:15:11,078 --> 00:15:13,038
BUT YOU DIDN'T SPEAK
TO A PHYSICIAN?

401
00:15:13,121 --> 00:15:16,625
(SIGHS) I...
I HOPED I WAS IMAGINING IT.

402
00:15:16,708 --> 00:15:19,002
THEN I JUST GOT SCARED.

403
00:15:19,086 --> 00:15:20,337
DOCTOR:
WELL SCARED OR NOT,
YOU PUT YOUR HEALTH,

404
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:22,214
AND YOUR BABY'S HEALTH
AT RISK.

405
00:15:22,297 --> 00:15:23,799
UH...

406
00:15:23,882 --> 00:15:25,634
OH, NO!
I-I TOOK SOME DIET PILLS.

407
00:15:25,717 --> 00:15:26,718

WERE THEY PRESCRIBED?

NO. I ONLY TOOK THEM
A COUPLE OF TIMES.

NEVER AGAIN, OKAY?

410
00:15:30,597 --> 00:15:32,474
HAVE YOU TAKEN FOLIC ACID?

411
00:15:32,558 --> 00:15:35,352
DONE ANYTHING TO OPTIMIZE
YOUR BABY'S HEALTH?

412
00:15:35,435 --> 00:15:36,395
I...

413
00:15:36,478 --> 00:15:40,482
GUESS I WAS JUST HOPING
IT WOULD JUST GO AWAY.

414
00:15:41,483 --> 00:15:43,861
WHAT IF,
WHAT IF THAT HAPPENED?

415
00:15:43,944 --> 00:15:45,946
ARE WE TALKING ABOUT ABORTION?

416
00:15:46,029 --> 00:15:48,323
BECAUSE THIS WOULD BE
A LATE-TERM ABORTION.

417
00:15:48,407 --> 00:15:49,700
AND USUALLY
THOSE ARE RESERVED

418
00:15:49,783 --> 00:15:52,452
FOR WOMEN WHOSE HEALTH
IS THREATENED.

419
00:15:52,536 --> 00:15:53,537
SO...

420
00:15:54,538 --> 00:15:56,039
IS IT TOO LATE?

421
00:15:56,123 --> 00:15:57,791
IT DEFINITELY POSES
GREATER RISKS,

422
00:15:57,875 --> 00:15:59,626
AND COMPLICATIONS.

423
00:16:00,627 --> 00:16:01,545
IF YOU WERE TO KEEP
THE BABY,

424
00:16:01,628 --> 00:16:03,839
WHAT SUPPORT MECHANISMS
WOULD YOU HAVE IN PLACE?

425
00:16:03,922 --> 00:16:05,340
UM, JUST ME.

00:16:05,424 --> 00:16:06,925
UM, OUR DAD'S WORKING
OUT WEST,

427

AND... HER MOM'S NOT
IN THE PICTURE.

428
00:16:10,137 --> 00:16:11,054
HMM.

429
00:16:11,138 --> 00:16:13,265
WILL THE BABY'S FATHER
BE INVOLVED?

430
00:16:13,348 --> 00:16:15,767
OH...
UH, I DON'T KNOW.

431
00:16:17,895 --> 00:16:21,231
WELL, ADOPTION
IS ANOTHER OPTION.

432
00:16:21,315 --> 00:16:23,901
NONE OF THEM'S EASY,
I'M AFRAID.

434
00:16:25,027 --> 00:16:27,738

TO AN AGENCY.

CAN WE PICK YOUR BRAIN?

00:17:02,064 --> 00:17:04,399
I GUESS, I COULD TAKE A LOOK.

447
00:17:04,483 --> 00:17:07,402
WITH ALL THESE VARIABLES,
I'M LOST.

448
00:17:08,487 --> 00:17:09,821
YEAH, IT LOOKS LIKE
YOU'VE GOT SOME FACTORIZATION

449
00:17:09,905 --> 00:17:11,198
OF POLYNOMIALS THERE.

450
00:17:11,281 --> 00:17:15,077
CAN YOU WORK THIS EQUATION

00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:16,161

452
00:17:20,958 --> 00:17:21,875
SO THAT'S ALL THAT HAPPENED?

453
00:17:21,959 --> 00:17:23,043
NOTHING ELSE?

454
00:17:24,419 --> 00:17:27,130
SHE JUST TOUCHED MY LEG.

455
00:17:27,214 --> 00:17:28,757
I'M SORRY.

456
00:17:28,841 --> 00:17:29,800
DO YOU KNOW HER NAME?

457
00:17:29,883 --> 00:17:31,802
WHERE SHE LIVES?

458
00:17:31,885 --> 00:17:32,886

YOU TOLD US, CONNOR.

471
00:18:00,455 --> 00:18:03,083
SO DOES THAT MEAN
I CAN USE MY COMPUTER AGAIN?

472
00:18:03,166 --> 00:18:05,794
YES,

473
00:18:06,795 --> 00:18:09,756

WE'D GET THROUGH THIS TOGETHER.

THAT'S WHEN I THOUGHT
WE WERE GETTING THROUGH

485
00:18:39,870 --> 00:18:41,663
THE SAME THING!

486
00:18:41,747 --> 00:18:43,165
I-I-I DIDN'T THINK
FOR ONE SECOND

487
00:18:43,248 --> 00:18:45,042
YOU'D ACTUALLY CONSIDER
HAVING THE BABY!

488
00:18:45,125 --> 00:18:47,836

WOULD BE RISKY!

489
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:49,963
HOW FAR ALONG ARE YOU?

00:18:50,047 --> 00:18:50,964

00:20:42,492 --> 00:20:44,536
♪ One day at a time ♪

532
00:20:45,704 --> 00:20:46,705
HEY.

533
00:20:48,832 --> 00:20:50,709
SO HOW'D IT GO WITH KC?

534
00:20:51,710 --> 00:20:54,880
I GUESS I'M A SINGLE
PARENT NOW.

535
00:20:56,465 --> 00:20:58,884
THIS IS GOING TO MEAN
BIG CHANGES FOR BOTH OF US.

536
00:20:58,967 --> 00:21:00,719
KYLE, I-I'M SO SORRY.

537
00:21:02,179 --> 00:21:03,222
THAT'S THE DEAL.

538
00:21:03,305 --> 00:21:05,474
YOUR LIFE IS MY LIFE.

539
00:21:05,557 --> 00:21:07,851
THE BABY'S TOO, I GUESS.

540
00:21:07,935 --> 00:21:09,144
IT'S NOT GONNA BE EASY
FOR THE LITTLE SQUIRT,

541
00:21:09,228 --> 00:21:10,437
BUT...

542
00:21:10,521 --> 00:21:14,733
AT LEAST HE'LL HAVE A COOL
UNCLE TO TAKE HIM MUDDING.

543
00:21:14,816 --> 00:21:16,151
SHE IS NEVER GOING MUDDING!

544
00:21:16,235 --> 00:21:17,819
(LAUGHS)

545
00:21:17,903 --> 00:21:20,447
SO, YOU'RE NOT MAD AT ME?

546
00:21:20,531 --> 00:21:22,324
IS IT MY FAVOURITE THING
THAT'S EVER HAPPENED?

547
00:21:22,407 --> 00:21:23,408
NO.

548
00:21:24,368 --> 00:21:25,911
IS IT GONNA SUCK
BIG TIME SOMETIMES?

549
00:21:25,994 --> 00:21:27,329
YES.

550
00:21:27,412 --> 00:21:30,207
BUT, HAVE WE BEEN
THROUGH WORSE?

551
00:21:30,290 --> 00:21:31,333
YEAH.

552
00:21:31,416 --> 00:21:34,086
THE MIDDLETONS DON'T GIVE UP.

553
00:21:35,087 --> 00:21:36,839
SO, WHAT NOW?

554
00:21:36,922 --> 00:21:38,757
(SIGHS)
I NEED A RIDE.

555
00:21:38,841 --> 00:21:40,175
WHERE TO, DOCTOR?

556
00:21:40,259 --> 00:21:41,385
NEXT TEEN STAR.

557
00:21:41,468 --> 00:21:43,512
WARDROBE FITTING.

558
00:21:43,595 --> 00:21:46,598
THE MIDDLETONS DON'T GIVE UP.
