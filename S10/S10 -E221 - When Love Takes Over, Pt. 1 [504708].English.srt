1
00:00:01,668 --> 00:00:03,212
LOVE IS IN THE AIR,
DEGRASSI!

2
00:00:03,295 --> 00:00:05,881
AND WHILE OUR HALLS
ARE STILL PDA-FREE,

3
00:00:05,964 --> 00:00:07,257
YOU CAN SHOW YOUR SWEETHEART
YOU CARE

4
00:00:07,341 --> 00:00:09,301
WITH A ROSE OR TWO,

5
00:00:09,384 --> 00:00:10,677
OR THREE.

6
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:13,096
HI.

7
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:16,099
(SIGHS)
UH, A DOZEN YELLOW.

8
00:00:16,183 --> 00:00:17,100
WHO'S THE LUCKY GUY?

9
00:00:17,184 --> 00:00:18,435
MY MOM.

10
00:00:18,519 --> 00:00:19,436
TODAY'S THE BIG DAY.

11
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:21,647
WE FIND OUT
IF HER RADIATION WORKED.

12
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:23,941
OOH!
BEST FRIEND SPECIAL.

13
00:00:24,024 --> 00:00:24,983
IF YOU NEED ME...

14
00:00:25,067 --> 00:00:26,026
I'LL CALL.

15
00:00:26,109 --> 00:00:28,195
BUT, UM, I'M REALLY HOPING
THAT I DON'T.

16
00:00:28,278 --> 00:00:29,279
YEAH.

17
00:00:36,912 --> 00:00:38,622
WHAT ABOUT ANYA
FOR THE PLAY?

18
00:00:38,705 --> 00:00:41,291
NO, TOO... CHEERFUL.

19
00:00:41,375 --> 00:00:42,334
WE'VE AUDITIONED
10 GIRLS,

20
00:00:42,417 --> 00:00:44,127
NOT ONE AS GOOD
AS MARISOL.

21
00:00:44,211 --> 00:00:45,462
OFFER TO RESIGN REINSTATED.

22
00:00:45,546 --> 00:00:47,172
AND AGAIN OVERRULED.

23
00:00:47,256 --> 00:00:48,674
WE'LL FIND YOU
A PERFECT LEADING LADY.

24
00:00:50,551 --> 00:00:51,552
THERE SHE IS.

25
00:00:53,679 --> 00:00:54,721
HEY, ADAM.

26
00:00:54,805 --> 00:00:55,806
ADIOS.

27
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:00,936
I'M STARTING TO GET THE FEELING
THAT YOU'RE IGNORING ME.

28
00:01:01,019 --> 00:01:02,187
SORRY I COULDN'T MAKE IT
TO YOUR PARTY, ADAM.

29
00:01:02,271 --> 00:01:03,397
I HAD TO WASH MY HAIR.

30
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:04,481
I WANTED TO COME.

31
00:01:04,565 --> 00:01:08,402
SOMETHING BETTER CAME UP.
IT'S OKAY, I GET IT.

32
00:01:08,485 --> 00:01:10,571
MY GREAT AUNT DIED.

33
00:01:12,489 --> 00:01:13,991
I BARELY KNEW HER,
BUT...

34
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:16,535
MY MOM WAS BEYOND UPSET.

35
00:01:16,618 --> 00:01:19,621
I, UH...
DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY.

36
00:01:19,705 --> 00:01:22,875
SAY YOU'LL LET ME
MAKE IT UP TO YOU?

37
00:01:22,958 --> 00:01:25,127
WELL, YOU PROBABLY WON'T
BE INTERESTED,

38
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:26,378
BUT...

39
00:01:26,461 --> 00:01:28,005
WE NEED A NEW LEADING LADY
FOR THE PLAY,

40
00:01:28,088 --> 00:01:31,842
AND...
YOU'D BE PERFECT.

41
00:01:31,925 --> 00:01:33,844
THERE SINGING INVOLVED?

42
00:01:33,927 --> 00:01:35,679
NO,

43
00:01:35,762 --> 00:01:37,931
BUT THERE'S A KISS.

44
00:01:38,932 --> 00:01:40,517
WITH ME.

45
00:01:40,601 --> 00:01:41,727
OKAY,

46
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:44,021
BUT I GET FINAL WARDROBE
APPROVAL.

47
00:01:44,104 --> 00:01:45,105

I DON'T COOK
AND I DON'T CLEAN.

64
00:02:39,952 --> 00:02:42,287
YOU WILL NOT FIND ME
HOLDING A BROOM

65
00:02:42,371 --> 00:02:44,581
OR SCRUBBING
ON MY HANDS AND KNEES.

66
00:02:44,665 --> 00:02:45,999
I EXPECT MEALS FOR ME

67
00:02:46,083 --> 00:02:47,876
PREPARED THREE TIMES A DAY...

68
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:50,295
(MOCKINGLY)
YOU LIKE HER!

69
00:02:50,379 --> 00:02:51,547
STOP IT!

70
00:02:52,798 --> 00:02:54,341
YOU LOOOOVE HER!

71
00:02:54,424 --> 00:02:56,176
DO NOT.

72
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:57,928
SHE LIKES YOU.

73
00:02:58,011 --> 00:03:01,181
WHY ELSE WOULD SHE AGREE
TO DO OUR PLAY?

74
00:03:01,265 --> 00:03:02,766
WELL...

75
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:04,810
MAYBE SHE DOESN'T KNOW
ABOUT ME.

76
00:03:04,893 --> 00:03:06,562
YOU KNOW,
FIONA KEEPS TO HERSELF.

77
00:03:06,645 --> 00:03:09,064
DOESN'T PAY ATTENTION
TO GOSSIP.

78
00:03:09,147 --> 00:03:11,149
IF I COULD GET HER
TO KNOW THE REAL ME FIRST,

79
00:03:11,233 --> 00:03:12,568
THEN MAYBE THE WHOLE
TRANSGENDER THING

80
00:03:12,651 --> 00:03:14,069
WOULDN'T MATTER
DOWN THE LINE.

81
00:03:14,152 --> 00:03:15,362
THAT'S A PRETTY BIG
"IF."

82
00:03:16,989 --> 00:03:18,615
SO, DO I HAVE THE PART?

83
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:24,121
THE LEADING MAN APPROVES!

84
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:26,206
BUT YOU'LL HAVE TO WORK HARD
TO CATCH UP.

85
00:03:27,291 --> 00:03:30,169
UH...YEAH.
I-I CAN HELP.

86
00:03:31,253 --> 00:03:33,255
ARE YOU FREE TONIGHT?

87
00:03:33,338 --> 00:03:36,675
WELL, I'D HAVE TO CANCEL
MY REIKI...

88
00:03:38,343 --> 00:03:40,387
BUT YOSHI WILL DEAL.

89
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:41,638
MY CONDO AT SEVEN?

90
00:03:41,722 --> 00:03:43,599
IT'S A DATE.

91
00:03:43,682 --> 00:03:44,725
WELL, NOT A-
NOT A DATE.

92
00:03:44,808 --> 00:03:47,561
(LAUGHS)
I'LL SEE YOU AT SEVEN, ADAM.

93
00:03:55,652 --> 00:03:56,820
(FRUSTRATED SIGH)

94
00:03:56,904 --> 00:03:59,448
HEY, YOU GUYS WANNA GET
A ROOM?

95
00:03:59,531 --> 00:04:01,325
HELLO?

96
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:02,910
GREAT.
GREAT, GREAT, GREAT.

97
00:04:02,993 --> 00:04:04,661
I'M GONNA BE LATE
FOR MATH AGAIN,

98
00:04:04,745 --> 00:04:05,787
'CAUSE THESE TWO HAVE
TURNED MY LOCKER

99
00:04:05,871 --> 00:04:07,456
INTO THEIR PERSONAL
LOVE NEST!

100
00:04:07,539 --> 00:04:09,833

I'M SO IN LOVE."

101
00:04:09,917 --> 00:04:11,627

TO SHOW IT IS TO SWAP SALIVA

102

103
00:04:13,962 --> 00:04:15,672
SWEETHEART WEEK BLOWS!

104
00:04:15,756 --> 00:04:17,382
JUST ANOTHER ACTIVITY
TO HIGHLIGHT THE GAP

105
00:04:17,466 --> 00:04:21,094
BETWEEN THE HAVES
AND THE HAVE NOTS.

106
00:04:22,346 --> 00:04:24,014
BUT, YOU KNOW,
I-I COULD BUY YOU A ROSE.

107
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:27,434
AND THEN I COULD CALL YOU
MY BOYFRIEND!

108
00:04:28,435 --> 00:04:30,187
THEN WE'D BE LOCKING LIPS.

109
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:32,648
THAT SOUNDS TERRIBLE.

110
00:04:32,731 --> 00:04:35,442
(LAUGHS)
YEAH, TOTALLY.

111
00:04:35,526 --> 00:04:37,277
OH, I'M-I'M DAVE.

112
00:04:37,361 --> 00:04:38,362
SADIE.

113
00:04:38,445 --> 00:04:39,446
SADIE.

114
00:04:40,447 --> 00:04:42,157
OH. UM, UH...

115
00:04:42,241 --> 00:04:43,325
BUT, YOU KNOW,
US SWEETHEART WEEK HATERS

116
00:04:43,408 --> 00:04:44,785
GOTTA-GOTTA STICK TOGETHER.

117
00:04:44,868 --> 00:04:46,662
YEAH, THERE'S STRENGTH
IN NUMBERS.

118
00:04:46,745 --> 00:04:47,704
RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT.

119
00:04:47,788 --> 00:04:48,914
SO, UH,

120
00:04:48,997 --> 00:04:51,500
WELL, WHAT DO YOU SAY
WE MEET UP SOMETIME?

121
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:55,295
SAY, THE DOT?
TOMORROW?

122
00:04:55,379 --> 00:04:57,548
YEAH, I'D LIKE THAT.

123
00:04:59,216 --> 00:05:00,259
(LAUGHS)

124
00:05:00,342 --> 00:05:01,677
OKAY, COOL.

125
00:05:04,805 --> 00:05:05,806
WHOA!

126
00:05:07,975 --> 00:05:11,311
DR. CHRIS:
SO, HERE ARE THE RESULTS
OF YOUR MOST RECENT M.R.I.

127
00:05:14,898 --> 00:05:17,317
ANYA:
I-I DON'T SEE ANYTHING.

128
00:05:19,194 --> 00:05:20,571
DOES THAT MEAN...

129
00:05:20,654 --> 00:05:21,989
IT MEANS THE CANCER'S GONE!

130
00:05:22,072 --> 00:05:22,990
EVERY SINGLE CELL OF IT.

131
00:05:23,073 --> 00:05:24,449
OH MY GOD!
AHH!

132
00:05:24,533 --> 00:05:26,243
OH MY GOD!
YOU SEE?

133
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:27,578
ANYA:
I TOLD YOU THERE'S NOTHING
TO BE WORRIED ABOUT!

134

(BOTH LAUGH EXCITEDLY)

135
00:05:29,496 --> 00:05:31,415
DR. CHRIS:
IF YOU'RE LUCKY,
YOU'LL NEVER SEE US AGAIN.

136
00:05:31,498 --> 00:05:33,333
OH! SO... UH, NEVER?

137
00:05:33,417 --> 00:05:35,252
SO THIS IS,
THIS IS GOODBYE, THEN?

138
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:36,670
I'M AFRAID SO.

139
00:05:36,753 --> 00:05:38,005
WE REALLY OWE YOU ONE,
DR. CHRIS.

140
00:05:38,088 --> 00:05:40,799
YOU AND YOUR TEAM
HAVE BEEN WONDERFUL!

141
00:05:40,883 --> 00:05:42,259
THANK YOU SO MUCH!

142
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:44,428

THANKS FOR EVERYTHING!

144
00:05:46,513 --> 00:05:47,431
ALL RIGHT.
COME ON,

145
00:05:47,514 --> 00:05:48,599
LET'S GO CALL DAD
WITH THE GOOD NEWS!

146
00:05:48,682 --> 00:05:49,766
YEAH!

147
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:51,393
PAM: BYE!
DR. CHRIS: BYE.

148
00:05:52,394 --> 00:05:53,812

(LAUGHS AWKWARDLY)

150
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:58,025
COME ON, THERE'LL BE
OTHER CUTE DOCTORS

151
00:05:58,108 --> 00:05:59,109
IN YOUR FUTURE.

152
00:05:59,193 --> 00:06:00,110
I HOPE SO.

153
00:06:00,194 --> 00:06:01,945

CINNAMON HEART?
I DON'T DESERVE IT.

157
00:06:10,579 --> 00:06:11,496
MY MOM'S CANCER FREE,

158
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:12,706
AND ALL I CAN THINK ABOUT
IS NO MORE VISITS

159
00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:14,625
TO THE HOSPITAL.

160
00:06:15,918 --> 00:06:17,836
THERE'S THIS BOY
THAT WORKS THERE.

161
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:18,837
A VOLUNTEER?

162
00:06:18,921 --> 00:06:21,298
UH, MORE LIKE
A TRAINING PROGRAM.

163
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:22,299
MED SCHOOL?

164
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:23,967
WHAT COMES AFTER THAT?

165
00:06:24,051 --> 00:06:26,094
ANYA, HE'S A DOCTOR?

166
00:06:26,178 --> 00:06:27,596
YOU CAN'T DATE A DOCTOR!

167
00:06:27,679 --> 00:06:30,182
HE'S ONLY A FIRST YEAR
RESIDENT.

168
00:06:30,265 --> 00:06:31,892
I KNOW, I KNOW!

169
00:06:31,975 --> 00:06:33,977
I JUST CAN'T STOP
THINKING ABOUT HIM.

170
00:06:34,061 --> 00:06:36,480
WELL, FOCUS ON
HIS ANNOYING HABITS.

171
00:06:36,563 --> 00:06:38,315
LIKE THE CUTE WAY
HE BITES HIS PEN?

172
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:39,608
YOU HAVE HIM
ON A PEDESTAL.

173
00:06:39,691 --> 00:06:40,609
IF YOU SPENT TIME
WITH HIM,

174
00:06:40,692 --> 00:06:42,528
YOU'D REALIZE
HE'S JUST A REGULAR JOE.

175
00:06:42,611 --> 00:06:43,570
WHO LEAVES HIS SEAT UP

176
00:06:43,654 --> 00:06:45,864
AND SPENDS HOURS
ON PLAYSTATION.

177
00:06:45,948 --> 00:06:46,907
EXACTLY.

178
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:48,325
SO WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS...

179
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:50,202
I NEED TO SPEND MORE TIME
WITH HIM.

180
00:06:50,285 --> 00:06:52,204
