ARE YOU LIKE,
BOYFRIEND, GIRLFRIEND?

182
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:06,760
IT'S NOT SERIOUS.

183
00:07:06,844 --> 00:07:08,303
IT'S ACTUALLY UNTIL
WE GRADUATE.

184
00:07:08,387 --> 00:07:12,182
AND THEN WE'RE GONNA GO
OUR SEPARATE WAYS.

185
00:07:12,266 --> 00:07:13,642
(STUMBLES OVER WORDS)
...O-OKAY.

186
00:07:13,725 --> 00:07:16,603
I MEAN,
IT'S NONE OF MY BUSINESS.

187
00:07:16,687 --> 00:07:18,188
I'M JUST GLAD
WE'RE TALKING AGAIN.

190
00:07:27,114 --> 00:07:29,366
YOU KNOW, WE COULD ALWAYS
WAIT FOR DAD IN THE THEATRE.

191
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:30,951
YOUR FATHER SAID
HE'D MEET US,

192
00:07:31,034 --> 00:07:33,203
SO WE COULD ALL
WALK IN TOGETHER.

193
00:07:33,287 --> 00:07:34,913
NOT THAT HE'S EVER ON TIME.

194
00:07:34,997 --> 00:07:36,039
EASY, MOM.

00:07:36,123 --> 00:07:37,875
(SIGHS)

196
00:07:37,958 --> 00:07:38,959
IS IT OKAY
IF I GO OUT TONIGHT,

197
00:07:39,042 --> 00:07:40,127
AFTER THE AWARDS?

198
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:41,211
THERE'S THIS AUTHOR READING
AT THE BOOKSHELF-

199
00:07:41,295 --> 00:07:42,212
NO, NOT TONIGHT.

200
00:07:42,296 --> 00:07:44,923
THAT'S GETTING PAST
YOUR CURFEW, ANYWAY.

201
00:07:45,007 --> 00:07:46,300
COULD YOU CALL,
AND SEE IF HE'S CLOSE?

202
00:07:46,383 --> 00:07:48,844
HE'LL SNAP AT ME IF I DO.

203
00:07:48,927 --> 00:07:50,512
SO YOU TWO ARE GOING TO BE
THIS ANNOYING ALL NIGHT,

204
00:07:50,596 --> 00:07:52,055

206
00:07:55,684 --> 00:07:58,061
YOUR FATHER AND I WANT
TO TALK TO YOU AFTERWARDS.

207
00:07:58,145 --> 00:08:01,231
IT'S IMPORTANT.
WHY, WHAT'S HAPPENING?

208
00:08:03,817 --> 00:08:04,902
NO...

209
00:08:04,985 --> 00:08:05,986

FIX YOUR TIE.

215
00:08:24,213 --> 00:08:25,589

220
00:08:38,185 --> 00:08:39,520
EXCUSE ME, LADY.

221
00:08:42,981 --> 00:08:44,608
I'VE GOT A GOOD FEELING
ABOUT TONIGHT.

222

(DOOR SLAMS)

533
00:19:19,326 --> 00:19:20,494
I'M JUST GONNA GO AHEAD
AND ASSUME

534
00:19:20,577 --> 00:19:22,746
YOU LOST YOUR PHONE!

535
00:19:23,497 --> 00:19:24,665
NO.

536
00:19:24,748 --> 00:19:27,376
I-I DIDN'T, IT'S RIGHT HERE.

537
00:19:27,459 --> 00:19:29,086
CLARE DIANA EDWARDS!

538
00:19:29,169 --> 00:19:30,629
IT'S MIDNIGHT!

539
00:19:30,712 --> 00:19:31,797
OH! SO IT IS.

540
00:19:33,131 --> 00:19:36,051
WELL, I AM GOING TO TUCK IN.

541
00:19:36,134 --> 00:19:38,262
DON'T TELL ME YOU GOT
A PIERCING!

542
00:19:38,345 --> 00:19:39,847
OKAY.

543
00:19:39,930 --> 00:19:41,056
I WON'T.

544
00:19:41,139 --> 00:19:42,474
YOUNG LADY,
WE HAD PLANS TONIGHT!

545
00:19:42,558 --> 00:19:44,893
OH, YEAH. OKAY,
GIVE ME THE BIG SURPRISE,

546
00:19:44,977 --> 00:19:46,728
IF YOU THINK I CAN HANDLE IT.

547
00:19:46,812 --> 00:19:48,605
WE WILL FIND SOME TIME
TOMORROW,

548
00:19:48,689 --> 00:19:51,024
WHEN YOU'RE NOT BEING
SO BELLIGERENT.

549
00:19:51,108 --> 00:19:52,568
WOW, YOU'RE BOTH MAD AT ME
FOR A CHANGE,

550
00:19:52,651 --> 00:19:54,486
INSTEAD OF EACH OTHER!

551
00:19:56,154 --> 00:19:57,155
REFRESHING!

552
00:19:59,366 --> 00:20:00,325
(SIGHS)

553
00:20:00,409 --> 00:20:01,910
SHE'S WELL WATERED
AND PLANTED,

554
00:20:01,994 --> 00:20:03,579
I JUST WOULDN'T PUT HER
IN DIRECT SUNLIGHT

555
00:20:03,662 --> 00:20:05,706
FOR A LITTLE WHILE.

556
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:09,376
THANKS FOR STAYING AFTER,
YOU KNOW...

557
00:20:09,459 --> 00:20:11,712
HEY. SHE'S MY FRIEND.

558
00:20:15,716 --> 00:20:18,468
DOES SHE DO THIS A LOT?

559
00:20:18,552 --> 00:20:21,221
SHE'S NOT USUALLY THIS BAD.

560
00:20:22,222 --> 00:20:24,183
UH, HAVE YOU CALLED ME
A TAXI YET?

561
00:20:24,266 --> 00:20:25,767
NO, NOT YET.

562
00:20:29,396 --> 00:20:31,148
(SIGHS) I JUST FEEL
LIKE I'VE ABANDONED HER,

563
00:20:31,231 --> 00:20:33,775
I FEEL LIKE SUCH A BAD BROTHER.

564
00:20:33,859 --> 00:20:35,194
DECLAN...

565
00:20:36,695 --> 00:20:38,697
YOU'RE A GOOD GUY.

566
00:20:44,703 --> 00:20:47,956
BUT NOT HALF AS GOOD
WITHOUT YOU.

567
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:52,336
WHAT AM I GONNA DO?

568
00:20:53,337 --> 00:20:55,756
JUST KEEP AN EYE
ON HER TONIGHT.

569
00:20:57,090 --> 00:20:58,091
NO...

570
00:21:01,261 --> 00:21:02,554
ABOUT US.

571
00:21:05,474 --> 00:21:06,642
(SCOFFS)

572
00:21:09,436 --> 00:21:13,732
I THOUGHT WE AGREED
THIS WASN'T GONNA HAPPEN.

573
00:21:15,192 --> 00:21:16,193
NO.

574
00:21:17,236 --> 00:21:19,196
WE SHOULDN'T BE DOING THIS.

575
00:21:19,279 --> 00:21:20,447
COME ON.

576
00:21:21,698 --> 00:21:23,367
THIS IS RIGHT.

577
00:21:25,744 --> 00:21:27,454
YOU KNOW IT IS.

578
00:21:28,956 --> 00:21:30,040
PLEASE.

579
00:21:31,291 --> 00:21:32,251
