WELL, UH, THE ONLY WAY
TO AVOID IT

32
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:08,986
WOULD BE TO DROP
THE CHARGES ALTOGETHER.

OF THE QUESTION.

00:21:17,444 --> 00:21:18,570
I KNOW WHAT WORKS FOR ME.

527
00:21:18,654 --> 00:21:19,655
(DOOR OPENS)

528
00:21:20,656 --> 00:21:22,533
WELL,

529
00:21:22,616 --> 00:21:25,118

00:21:25,202 --> 00:21:26,954
AND FIONA YOU WERE...

531
00:21:28,372 --> 00:21:29,540
MEMORABLE.

532
00:21:29,623 --> 00:21:33,252
SO, IT LOOKS LIKE DEGRASSI'S
"NIGHT IN VEGAS" IS A GO!

533
00:21:33,335 --> 00:21:34,503
YEP! WHOO HOO!

534
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:39,758
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

535
00:21:39,842 --> 00:21:40,926
FIONA:

536
00:21:41,009 --> 00:21:43,136
I KNOW WHAT WORKS FOR ME.
