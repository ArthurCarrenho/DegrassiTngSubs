I'LL BE THE BEST
IN THE WORLD.

351
00:15:54,121 --> 00:15:56,874
WHAT ARE YOU THE BEST
IN THE WORLD AT, DAVE?

352
00:15:56,957 --> 00:15:58,959
PFFFTT! HMPH! PSHA!
YOU KNOW.

353
00:16:00,085 --> 00:16:01,003
I HAVE TO PRACTICE.

354

HOLLY J:
MS. GREYSON? BEV?

359
00:16:12,598 --> 00:16:15,100
HI. LOOK, I'M REALLY SORRY,
BUT-

360
00:16:15,184 --> 00:16:17,519
YOU'RE SORRY?
COME ON!

361
00:16:17,603 --> 00:16:19,563
YOU DON'T HAVE TO SPEND A MINT
ON RUNNING GEAR.

362
00:16:19,646 --> 00:16:20,939
NOT A FASHION SHOW,
RIGHT?

363
00:16:21,023 --> 00:16:21,940
YEAH.
NO, I'M ACTUALLY-

364
00:16:22,024 --> 00:16:22,941
CHANTAY!

365
00:16:23,025 --> 00:16:24,776
HEY, BEV!
ALL SET FOR THE RUN!

366
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:27,863
I THOUGHT I'D TAKE SOME PHOTOS
FOR THE BLOG.

367
00:16:27,946 --> 00:16:29,865
YOU TWO ARE SUCH
GO-GETTERS!

368
00:16:29,948 --> 00:16:31,533
I'M GONNA NEED PEOPLE LIKE YOU
WITH BOUNDLESS ENERGY

369
00:16:31,617 --> 00:16:34,036

370
00:16:34,119 --> 00:16:35,120
KEEP A SECRET?

371
00:16:36,330 --> 00:16:38,707
I'M RUNNING FOR MAYOR
THIS SUMMER!

372
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:40,751
MAYOR? WOW.

373
00:16:40,834 --> 00:16:42,169
THIS WORK-STUDY COULD
TURN INTO A SUMMER JOB

374
00:16:42,252 --> 00:16:44,421
FOR BOTH OF YOU.

375
00:16:44,505 --> 00:16:46,048
(EXHALES)

376
00:16:46,131 --> 00:16:47,966
EVERYTHING OKAY?

377
00:16:49,301 --> 00:16:51,136
IT'S A SORE THROAT.
IT'S NOTHING.

378
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:52,971
SHIRLEY KEEPS SOME LOZENGES
IN HER DESK.

379
00:16:53,055 --> 00:16:54,431

380
00:16:54,515 --> 00:16:55,557
GREAT!

381
00:16:55,641 --> 00:16:56,600
I CAN'T WAIT TO DO
THIS RUN!

382
00:16:56,683 --> 00:16:57,851
I HOPE YOU TWO
CAN KEEP UP.

383
00:17:05,609 --> 00:17:08,570
A MINUTE AND...
A HUNDRED AND THREE!

(FRUSTRATED GRUNT)

385
00:17:09,821 --> 00:17:11,490
IS SOMETHING WRONG
WITH MY FORM?

386
00:17:11,573 --> 00:17:13,325
LOOKS NORMAL TO ME.

387
00:17:14,326 --> 00:17:17,412
BUT I NEED TO DO
135 JUMPS A MINUTE

388
00:17:17,496 --> 00:17:19,581
FOR TWENTY-FOUR HOURS!

389
00:17:19,665 --> 00:17:21,208
I SWEAR I USED TO BE
BETTER AT THIS!

390
00:17:21,291 --> 00:17:22,584
YOU'LL JUST HAVE
TO GET FASTER.

391
00:17:22,668 --> 00:17:24,002
I DON'T THINK I CAN.

392
00:17:24,086 --> 00:17:26,129
MY UNCLE ONLY SIGNED ME
OUT OF CLASS FOR TOMORROW!

393
00:17:26,213 --> 00:17:28,298
I MEAN...
(PANTS)

394
00:17:28,382 --> 00:17:30,384
SHOULD I PACK IT IN?

395
00:17:30,467 --> 00:17:31,927
DAVE:
HEY DEGRASSI,
SPARE TIME TOMORROW?

396
00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:33,512
COME SEE
WES "THE ANIMAL" BETENKAMP

397
00:17:33,595 --> 00:17:34,805

ALLI:
CLOTHES, A WIG, A FAKE ID...

402
00:17:45,774 --> 00:17:46,692
EVERYTHING WE NEEDED,

403
00:17:46,775 --> 00:17:48,443

TO LEAVE YOUR FLOOR.

JOHNNY:
ISN'T IT GREAT HERE?

405
00:17:49,695 --> 00:17:50,696
YEAH.

406
00:17:50,779 --> 00:17:53,866
ALL RIGHT.
NEXT STOP, THE BUS STATION,

407
00:17:53,949 --> 00:17:56,285
AND A FRESH BEGINNING
FOR ALLI BHANDARI.

408
00:17:56,368 --> 00:17:57,369
YOU DON'T WANT
TO LOOK AROUND CAMPUS

409
00:17:57,452 --> 00:17:58,954
A BIT MORE?

410
00:17:59,037 --> 00:18:00,747
WE GOT THE BEST LIBRARY
IN THE COUNTRY.

411
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:02,124
NOT GONNA WORK,
JOHNNY.

412
00:18:02,207 --> 00:18:03,125
WHAT WON'T?

413
00:18:03,208 --> 00:18:05,586
YOU TRYING TO KEEP ME HERE
UNTIL I GO HOME.

414
00:18:05,669 --> 00:18:08,505
YOU'VE ONLY GOT TWO YEARS
UNTIL UNIVERSITY.

415
00:18:08,589 --> 00:18:09,631
TWO MORE YEARS OF PARENTS,

416
00:18:09,715 --> 00:18:11,383
AND THEN THOSE NEURO SCIENCE
EXPERIMENTS,

417
00:18:11,466 --> 00:18:13,093
LIVING IN A DORM -
THAT COULD BE YOU!

418
00:18:13,177 --> 00:18:15,679
HERE'S WHAT YOU DON'T GET:
THIS CAN NEVER BE MY REALITY.

419
00:18:15,762 --> 00:18:17,764
MY PARENTS WOULD NEVER
LET ME LIVE IN A REZ.

420
00:18:17,848 --> 00:18:18,974
IF I GO BACK HOME,

421
00:18:19,057 --> 00:18:20,017
I'LL BE UNDER LOCK
AND KEY FOREVER.

422
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:21,727
RUNNING AWAY
IS MY ONLY ESCAPE.

423
00:18:21,810 --> 00:18:23,645
ALLI, I'VE BEEN THERE.

424
00:18:24,938 --> 00:18:25,856
I STOOD NEXT TO A DUDE

425
00:18:25,939 --> 00:18:27,608
WHO STABBED A GUY
THAT EVERYONE LOVED,

426
00:18:27,691 --> 00:18:29,151
AND THEN I HAD TO GO
TO THAT KID'S SCHOOL.

427
00:18:29,234 --> 00:18:30,110
IT'S NOT THE SAME.

428
00:18:30,194 --> 00:18:32,821
IT WAS HELL WITH MY PARENTS
AFTER THAT,

429
00:18:32,905 --> 00:18:35,741
BUT WE WORKED THROUGH IT.

430
00:18:35,824 --> 00:18:38,744
AND NOW I'M HERE
AND I'M DIFFERENT.

431
00:18:40,746 --> 00:18:42,664
EVERYTHING'S GREAT.

432
00:18:47,085 --> 00:18:50,172
MAYBE I'LL STAY
ONE MORE NIGHT.

433
00:18:50,255 --> 00:18:52,674
THINK I CAN STILL GET THAT
CAMPUS TOUR?

442

LOOK BAD.

443

YOU'RE DOING THAT
TO YOURSELF.

444
00:19:17,824 --> 00:19:18,742
YOUR BODY'S
TELLING YOU SOMETHING

445
00:19:18,825 --> 00:19:19,993
AND YOU'RE NOT LISTENING.

446
00:19:20,077 --> 00:19:21,119
OKAY, WHAT IS MY BODY
TRYING TO TELL ME,

447
00:19:21,203 --> 00:19:22,871
IF YOU'RE SO SMART?

448
00:19:22,955 --> 00:19:26,542
YOU AND SAV,
ARE YOU SEXUALLY ACTIVE?

449
00:19:26,625 --> 00:19:28,669
SPARE ME, OKAY?
I'M NOT PREGNANT.

450
00:19:28,752 --> 00:19:29,711
IS THERE ANY CHANCE?

451
00:19:29,795 --> 00:19:30,796
NO!

452
00:19:32,130 --> 00:19:33,674

WELL, YOU'RE SOMETHING.

455
00:19:37,302 --> 00:19:39,513
AND WHATEVER IT IS,
YOU'D BETTER START DEALING.

456
00:19:39,596 --> 00:19:40,722

IF YOU WANT.

I NEED RIGHT NOW

494

IS FOR IT TO BE SOMETHING.
