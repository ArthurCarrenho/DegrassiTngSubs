IS THAT SO WRONG?

WHATEVER THEY WANT.

ABOUT THAT?

16
00:00:32,491 --> 00:00:33,951

(LIGHT SLAP)
WAKE UP, BRO!

183
00:06:43,737 --> 00:06:45,280

185
00:06:46,907 --> 00:06:47,824
YEAH.

186
00:06:47,908 --> 00:06:50,160
OH MAN, HAVEN'T YOU CONQUERED
THAT VILLAGE OR WHATEVER YET?

187
00:06:50,244 --> 00:06:51,537
IT'S A REALM,
NOT A VILLAGE.

188
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:54,039
I CAN CONQUER A VILLAGE
IN LIKE AN HOUR.

189
00:06:54,122 --> 00:06:55,916
I LOVE RPGS AS MUCH
AS THE NEXT GUY,

190
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:57,668
BUT YOU'VE GONE TOO DEEP,
MAN.

191
00:06:57,751 --> 00:06:58,669
COME UP FOR AIR.

00:06:58,752 --> 00:06:59,753
DAVE:

193
00:06:59,837 --> 00:07:01,171
YOU DON'T GET IT.

194
00:07:02,756 --> 00:07:03,966
NOBODY IN REAL LIFE DOES.

195
00:07:04,049 --> 00:07:05,384
REAL LIFE?

196
00:07:06,385 --> 00:07:08,178
YOU SHOULD TRY IT
SOMETIME.

197
00:07:09,221 --> 00:07:10,305
DAVE.

198
00:07:11,974 --> 00:07:14,184
ANYONE HAVE ANY QUESTIONS
ABOUT THE RESULTS?

199
00:07:15,936 --> 00:07:18,105
THERE MAY BE A TEST.

203
00:07:25,696 --> 00:07:26,697
COME ON, HOLLY J.

204
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:28,073
NOT ALL OF US WENT
TO THE LYCEE FRANCAIS

205
00:07:28,156 --> 00:07:29,074
AS CHILDREN.

206
00:07:29,157 --> 00:07:30,409
TRANSLATION?

207
00:07:30,492 --> 00:07:33,495
NAUSEATING,
DISGUSTING, GROSS.

208
00:07:33,579 --> 00:07:34,580
SAV:
WHAT'S GROSS?

209
00:07:34,663 --> 00:07:35,914
HOLLY J'S ZIT.

210
00:07:35,998 --> 00:07:37,207
FIONA!

211
00:07:37,291 --> 00:07:40,752
NAW, IT'S CUTE.
IT'S HUMANIZING.

212
00:07:40,836 --> 00:07:41,795
UM...

213
00:07:41,879 --> 00:07:44,882
SO I WAS THINKING ABOUT
THE DANCE AND UH...

214
00:07:44,965 --> 00:07:47,259
BALLOONS - TOO CORNY?

215
00:07:47,342 --> 00:07:48,552
IT'S A HARVEST HOE-DOWN.

216
00:07:48,635 --> 00:07:50,679
I DON'T THINK ANYTHING
CAN BE TOO CORNY.

217
00:07:50,762 --> 00:07:53,473
(CHUCKLES) YEAH, YEAH.
YOU'RE RIGHT.

218
00:07:53,557 --> 00:07:56,476
I DON'T KNOW HOW I WOULD SURVIVE
WITHOUT YOU.

219
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,561
(CHUCKLES)

220
00:08:01,398 --> 00:08:02,566
(GIGGLES)

221
00:08:02,649 --> 00:08:05,152
ALSO ECOEURANT?
SAV'S CRUSH ON YOU.

222
00:08:05,235 --> 00:08:06,236
SAV?!

223
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,237
ALL THE SIGNS
ARE THERE:

224
00:08:07,321 --> 00:08:09,239
DILATED PUPILS,
GOOFY GRIN,

225
00:08:09,323 --> 00:08:10,407

226
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:11,783
TAKE IT FROM SOMEONE
WHO KNOWS.

227
00:08:11,867 --> 00:08:12,784
PLEASE.

228
00:08:12,868 --> 00:08:14,661
SAV JUST NEEDS SOMEONE
TO BE NICE TO HIM RIGHT NOW.

229
00:08:14,745 --> 00:08:16,872
SOUNDS LIKE SOMEONE ELSE
I KNOW.

230
00:08:16,955 --> 00:08:18,582
AND YOU AND SAV HAVE BEEN
SPENDING A LOT OF TIME

231
00:08:18,665 --> 00:08:20,375
ON STUDENT COUNCIL
TOGETHER.

232
00:08:20,459 --> 00:08:22,252
WELL, WE HAVE JOBS TO DO,
FIONA.

233
00:08:22,336 --> 00:08:23,587
IT'S STRICTLY
PROFESSIONAL.

234
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:24,588
WHATEVER.

235
00:08:24,671 --> 00:08:26,340
BOYS CAN SMELL
VULNERABILITY.

236
00:08:26,423 --> 00:08:27,257
SOMEDAY, MISS COYNE,

237
00:08:27,341 --> 00:08:29,301
YOU'LL LEARN THAT BOYS
CAN JUST BE FRIENDS.

238
00:08:29,384 --> 00:08:30,469
AS LONG
AS THEY'RE GAY.

239
00:08:30,552 --> 00:08:32,596
WHAT'S THE FRENCH WORD
FOR PESSIMISM?

240
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:33,764
JUST DON'T BE SURPRISED

241
00:08:33,847 --> 00:08:35,599
WHEN SAV DECLARES HIS LOVE
FOR YOU.

242
00:08:35,682 --> 00:08:37,893
IT'S NEVER GONNA HAPPEN,
BECAUSE WE'RE JUST FRIENDS.

243
00:08:39,144 --> 00:08:40,812
PERINO:
THERE ARE TWO KINDS
OF STUDENTS:

244
00:08:40,896 --> 00:08:41,563

245
00:08:41,647 --> 00:08:44,525
THOSE WHO TAKE ENOUGH TIME
AND DO THE WORK PROPERLY;

246
00:08:44,608 --> 00:08:46,652
AND THOSE THAT START THE ESSAY
THE NIGHT BEFORE

247
00:08:46,735 --> 00:08:48,028
AND THINK I WON'T NOTICE.

248
00:08:49,404 --> 00:08:50,405
RESEARCH IS THE KEY
TO THIS ASSIGNMENT...

249
00:08:50,489 --> 00:08:51,740
(QUIETLY)
DID YOU HEAR ABOUT
THE DANCE?

250

271
00:09:26,567 --> 00:09:28,485

(CHUCKLING)
WELL, GOOD.

331
00:11:19,972 --> 00:11:21,640
BECAUSE I DID
SOME RESEARCH

332
00:11:21,723 --> 00:11:24,434
AND I PRINTED THIS OFF
FOR YOU.

333
00:11:24,518 --> 00:11:26,311
I DON'T NEED ANY HELP,
ALLI.

334
00:11:26,395 --> 00:11:28,230
WELL, I JUST THOUGHT
THAT IF WE TAG-TEAMED

335
00:11:28,313 --> 00:11:29,481
IT WOULD FREE UP SOME TIME
FOR THE DANCE.

336
00:11:29,565 --> 00:11:30,566

UH, HOLLY J,

530
00:19:08,482 --> 00:19:09,858
I HAVE A CONFESSION
TO MAKE.

531
00:19:09,942 --> 00:19:11,193
SAV, ME TOO.

532
00:19:11,276 --> 00:19:12,486
DON'T KILL ME,

533
00:19:12,569 --> 00:19:15,280
BUT THOSE ARE THE REST
OF THE BALLOONS.

534
00:19:15,364 --> 00:19:17,491
ARE YOU KIDDING?
THEY WEREN'T INFLATED?!

535
00:19:17,574 --> 00:19:18,951
YEAH, APPARENTLY
YOU HAVE TO SPECIFY.

536
00:19:19,034 --> 00:19:19,952
I DON'T KNOW.

537
00:19:20,035 --> 00:19:22,162
ONLY 495 MORE TO GO THOUGH,
SO...

538
00:19:22,246 --> 00:19:26,083
ANY CHANCE YOU COULD SKIP
NEXT PERIOD?

539
00:19:26,166 --> 00:19:28,460
ANYTHING TO GET OUT
OF FRENCH.

540
00:19:28,544 --> 00:19:31,463
THERE IS AN UPSIDE,
HOWEVER.

541
00:19:32,422 --> 00:19:33,674
(AIR SQUEAKING)

542
00:19:35,467 --> 00:19:37,427
(HELIUM VOICE)
YOU GET TO HANG OUT
WITH YOUR PRESIDENT!

543
00:19:37,511 --> 00:19:40,055
WHOA!
EASY ON THE GAS, MR. PREZ!

544
00:19:40,138 --> 00:19:41,181
(HELIUM VOICE)
ALL THE COOL KIDS
ARE DOING IT.

545
00:19:41,265 --> 00:19:43,225
YOU KNOW YOU WANT TO.

546
00:19:43,308 --> 00:19:44,309
MMM...

547
00:19:45,477 --> 00:19:46,895
(AIR SQUEAKING)

548
00:19:46,979 --> 00:19:47,896
(HELIUM VOICE)
THERE'S JUST SO MUCH
PEER PRESSURE.

549
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:48,981
BOTH:
(LAUGHING)

550
00:19:51,608 --> 00:19:52,985
(AIR SQUEAKING)

551
00:19:53,068 --> 00:19:56,071
"HELIUM:
IT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO."

552
00:19:56,154 --> 00:19:57,155
BOTH:
(LAUGHING)

553
00:20:01,285 --> 00:20:02,411
WOW.

554
00:20:02,494 --> 00:20:03,495
HI.

555
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:06,456
I'M SORRY.
UM...

556
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:08,917
I THOUGHT...

557
00:20:09,001 --> 00:20:12,379
NO, YEAH, IT'S FINE.
(NERVOUS CHUCKLE)

558
00:20:12,462 --> 00:20:13,797
SHOOT, UM...

559
00:20:15,883 --> 00:20:17,134
I WAS SUPPOSED
TO MEET FIONA,

560
00:20:17,217 --> 00:20:19,678
SO IS IT OKAY
IF WE FINISH THESE LATER?

561
00:20:19,761 --> 00:20:21,430

TO THE DANCE, SO-

580
00:21:08,310 --> 00:21:10,604
YEAH, SO YOU MADE ME
LOOK LIKE AN IDIOT?

581
00:21:10,687 --> 00:21:12,814

TO THE DANCE?

584
00:21:16,193 --> 00:21:17,402
OKAY, WHY?

585
00:21:19,404 --> 00:21:20,322
THERE'S A TRIAL PERIOD

586
00:21:20,405 --> 00:21:22,616
BEFORE I CAN GIVE SOMEONE
THE GIRLFRIEND LABEL.

587
00:21:22,699 --> 00:21:24,660
OKAY, SO WHAT?
I HAD TO PASS SOME KIND OF TEST?

588
00:21:24,743 --> 00:21:26,995
YEAH.
AND YOU FAILED!

589
00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:31,875
FORGET IT.
I THOUGHT YOU WERE WORTH IT,

590
00:21:31,959 --> 00:21:34,044
