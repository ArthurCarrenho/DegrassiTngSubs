00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:16,443
NOT YOURS.

541
00:21:16,527 --> 00:21:17,861
YOU DONE?

542
00:21:17,945 --> 00:21:18,904
YEAH.

543
00:21:19,905 --> 00:21:21,990
LET'S HANG OUT.

544
00:21:22,074 --> 00:21:24,159
WAIT, YOU DON'T CARE
ABOUT THAT?

545
00:21:24,243 --> 00:21:25,577
THAT YOU SAID A FEW
STUPID THINGS

546
00:21:25,661 --> 00:21:27,079
WHILE YOU WERE HIGH?

547
00:21:27,162 --> 00:21:29,957
I'M NOT YOUR JUDGEY FRIENDS.

548
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:31,500
SO...

549
00:21:31,583 --> 00:21:32,835
ARE YOU COMING?

550
00:21:33,877 --> 00:21:35,921
UNLESS YOU HAVE
A BETTER OFFER?

551
00:21:37,631 --> 00:21:39,424
(SIGHS)

552
00:21:39,508 --> 00:21:40,676
