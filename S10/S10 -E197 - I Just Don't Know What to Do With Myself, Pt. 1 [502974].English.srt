176
00:07:35,956 --> 00:07:37,875
I KEPT AN 'A' AVERAGE.

177
00:07:37,958 --> 00:07:41,879
I CAN DO GREAT THINGS.
MAYBE BE THE NEXT OBAMA.

178
00:07:41,962 --> 00:07:43,922
BUT I NEED
A LITTLE MORE SUPPORT.

179
00:07:44,006 --> 00:07:45,257
WHAT IS THIS ABOUT,
SAV?

180
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:46,133
I WANT TO BORROW YOUR TRUCK.

181
00:07:46,216 --> 00:07:48,135
HA! I TOLD YOU, NO-

182
00:07:48,218 --> 00:07:50,888
NOT FOR THE CONCERT!

183
00:07:50,971 --> 00:07:52,472
FOR A STUDENT COUNCIL
FUND-RAISER.

184
00:07:52,556 --> 00:07:53,849
IT JUST HAS TO SIT
IN THE PARKING LOT.

185
00:07:53,932 --> 00:07:57,144
LAST PERSON WITH THEIR HAND
ON IT WINS THE TICKETS-

186
00:07:57,227 --> 00:07:59,479
THAT I'M GIVING AWAY.

187
00:08:04,318 --> 00:08:06,987
YOU'LL WASH IT
AFTERWARDS?

188
00:08:07,988 --> 00:08:08,864
REALLY?!

189
00:08:08,947 --> 00:08:11,283
IF IT COMES BACK WITH
SO MUCH AS A SCRATCH-

190
00:08:11,366 --> 00:08:14,244
I WILL NOT LET YOU DOWN.

191

HOW LONG DO YOU THINK THESE

203
00:08:45,526 --> 00:08:48,529
IT'S ALREADY BEEN TWO HOURS.
MAYBE A COUPLE MORE?

00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:54,743
YEAH, TOTALLY WORTH
GIVING UP THE TICKETS.

208
00:08:54,826 --> 00:08:57,621
YOU GAVE UP BACKSTAGE PASSES
TO THE DEAD HAND?

209
00:08:57,704 --> 00:08:59,081
ALL FOR A GOOD CAUSE.

210

213
00:09:06,755 --> 00:09:09,132
YEAH, BUT TODAY,
INSTEAD OF "OCEAN SURF,"

214
00:09:09,216 --> 00:09:11,593
I USED "DAY-OLD TROUT."

215
00:09:14,221 --> 00:09:17,641
(FRUSTRATED GROAN)
I NEEDED THOSE PASSES.

216
00:09:17,724 --> 00:09:20,060
NOW RON-RON'S
GONNA GO WITHOUT ME!

217
00:09:21,603 --> 00:09:25,941
I'D LITERALLY DO ANYTHING

218
00:09:27,401 --> 00:09:29,778
SAV:
IS IT TOO LATE TO ENTER
THE CONTEST?

219
00:09:29,862 --> 00:09:30,988
I'M SORRY, MR. PRESIDENT.

220
00:09:31,071 --> 00:09:34,157
THAT'S A CONFLICT
OF INTEREST.

221

222
00:09:35,242 --> 00:09:37,411
LAST HARD PRACTICE 'TIL NEXT
WEEK.

223
00:09:37,494 --> 00:09:40,497
NOW? WE JUST FOCUS ON LOOKING
GOOD FOR THE CALENDAR!

224
00:09:40,581 --> 00:09:42,499
JENNA:
7 DAYS TO LOSE 10 POUNDS.

225
00:09:42,583 --> 00:09:45,002
ANYA:
NOTHING A WEEK OF SPINACH
AND EGG WHITES CAN'T FIX!

226
00:09:45,085 --> 00:09:47,838
(LAUGHING) OH...
YOU'RE SERIOUS?

227
00:09:47,921 --> 00:09:49,173
SO ARE YOU ON A DIET, TOO?

228
00:09:49,256 --> 00:09:51,175
OH GOD, NO!
I EAT WHATEVER I WANT.

229
00:09:51,258 --> 00:09:52,342
CHANTAY:
YEAH, BUT WE CAN'T ALL HAVE

230
00:09:52,426 --> 00:09:54,011
THE GENETICS
OF STRING BEAN MACPHERSON.

231
00:09:54,094 --> 00:09:55,345
SO YOU TOO, THEN?

232
00:09:55,429 --> 00:09:58,891
I WATCH MY CALORIES,
BUT I DON'T OBSESS ABOUT IT.

233
00:09:58,974 --> 00:10:01,143
YOU COWS REALLY
WANNA LOSE SOME WEIGHT?

234
00:10:01,226 --> 00:10:03,228
I GOT PILLS
THAT'LL MELT IT OFF.

235
00:10:03,312 --> 00:10:04,313
FAT INHIBITORS.

236
00:10:04,396 --> 00:10:06,231

238
00:10:08,483 --> 00:10:09,985
OR AT LEAST HALF
OF YOU.

239
00:10:10,068 --> 00:10:12,154
IF YOU DON'T GET LOST,
BIANCA,

240
00:10:12,237 --> 00:10:16,408
ALL OF ME IS GOING TO
MAKE YOU WISH YOU DID.

241
00:10:17,951 --> 00:10:19,912
ANYWAY, IT'S SIMPLE.

242
00:10:19,995 --> 00:10:22,039
I JUST FOCUS ON BURNING MORE
CALORIES THAN I EAT.

243
00:10:22,122 --> 00:10:26,043
AND I CERTAINLY EAT MORE THAN
SPINACH AND EGG WHITES.

244
00:10:27,586 --> 00:10:29,963
SAV:
♪ And what makes me most sad ♪

245

HOW EXACTLY

249
00:10:45,062 --> 00:10:48,649
WE SPLIT FOUR PASSES,
THREE WAYS?

250
00:10:48,732 --> 00:10:50,400
I DON'T KNOW. I JUST-

251
00:10:50,484 --> 00:10:52,319
OH! I REALLY GOTTA GO.

252
00:10:53,654 --> 00:10:55,239

262
00:11:24,184 --> 00:11:25,978
(GRUNTS WITH EFFORT)

263
00:11:26,061 --> 00:11:27,729
CAREFUL, IT'S HEAVY.

265

200 BUCKS PLUS LABOUR

00:12:09,313 --> 00:12:10,314
HEY, MAN.

277
00:12:11,565 --> 00:12:12,941
SORRY ABOUT THE TAIL LIGHT. I-

278
00:12:13,025 --> 00:12:13,942
I'M PRETTY DECENT
WITH CARS.

279
00:12:14,026 --> 00:12:15,110
MAYBE I CAN HELP YOU
REPLACE IT?

280
00:12:15,194 --> 00:12:16,445
YEAH? WITH WHAT?

281
00:12:16,528 --> 00:12:19,531
YOU KNOW, A GENEROUS DONATION

283
00:12:21,867 --> 00:12:23,869

PETER:
NEW FRIEND?

288
00:12:36,507 --> 00:12:38,550
AH NO, HE'S JUST ONE OF
THE GUYS WHO WON THE CONTEST.

289
00:12:38,634 --> 00:12:40,260
NO, BUT LIKE,
HE'S INTO DEAD HAND

290
00:12:40,344 --> 00:12:42,638
SO MAYBE HE COULD BE
YOUR NEW FRIEND.

291
00:12:42,721 --> 00:12:44,139
NO.
HE'S IN GRADE 11.

292
00:12:44,223 --> 00:12:46,767
DUDE, YOU WERE IN GRADE 10
WHEN WE FORMED STUDZ.

293
00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:49,186
THE YOUNGER GUYS
ARE JUST LOST.

294
00:12:49,269 --> 00:12:51,813
THEY'RE LOOKING
FOR A HERO.

295
00:12:52,814 --> 00:12:54,566
YEAH, I COULD BE HIS
OBI-WAN...

296
00:12:54,650 --> 00:12:55,817
MAN, I'D BE GOING
TO THIS CONCERT

297
00:12:55,901 --> 00:12:59,655
IF I DIDN'T HAVE MY FIRST
UNIVERSITY MIDTERM.

298
00:12:59,738 --> 00:13:01,823
WHAT'S YOUR EXCUSE?

299
00:13:07,204 --> 00:13:08,580
OH, HEY! UM...

300
00:13:09,581 --> 00:13:13,085
DO YOU STILL NEED A PASS
TO THE DEAD HAND REUNION SHOW?

301
00:13:13,168 --> 00:13:15,128
A BACKSTAGE PASS?

302
00:13:15,212 --> 00:13:16,338
DON'T BE JERKING ME
AROUND HERE.

303
00:13:16,421 --> 00:13:19,842
NO, SERIOUSLY!
I GOT ONE MORE.

304
00:13:19,925 --> 00:13:23,136
YOU'RE A LIFESAVER!
NAME YOUR PRICE.

305
00:13:24,137 --> 00:13:26,557
UM, SAY... 200 BUCKS.

306
00:13:30,352 --> 00:13:32,104
I PLANNED THIS
FABULOUS WEEKEND.

307
00:13:32,187 --> 00:13:34,356
MASSAGES,
DESSERT TASTINGS.

308
00:13:34,439 --> 00:13:36,400
AND SHE JUST SAID NO!

309
00:13:37,401 --> 00:13:38,151
LET ME ASK YOU THIS:

310
00:13:38,235 --> 00:13:40,070
WHY DID YOU ARRANGE
TO HAVE THE MASSAGES

311
00:13:40,153 --> 00:13:41,738
HERE AT YOUR CONDO?

312
00:13:41,822 --> 00:13:44,199
WELL, BECAUSE I WANTED
HER TO COME OVER.

313
00:13:44,283 --> 00:13:47,911
YOU SPENT ALL THAT MONEY
TO AVOID BEING ALONE?

314
00:13:47,995 --> 00:13:51,582
DOESN'T THAT SOUND LIKE TRYING
TO BUY COMPANIONSHIP?

315
00:13:51,665 --> 00:13:54,960
I DON'T NEED TO BUY HOLLY J.
SHE ALREADY OWES ME.

316
00:13:55,043 --> 00:13:58,463
AND WHY DO YOU FEEL
SHE OWES YOU?

317
00:13:58,547 --> 00:14:01,216
IT'S A LONG STORY.
SHARPEN YOUR PENCIL.

318
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:03,802
SO IT ALL STARTED WHEN HOLLY J
CAME BACK FROM NEW YORK-

319
00:14:03,886 --> 00:14:04,636
(TIMER BEEPS)
OH, FIONA,

320
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:07,306
UNFORTUNATELY,
I'M OUT OF TIME.

321
00:14:07,389 --> 00:14:08,557
WE'LL CONTINUE THIS
NEXT WEEK.

322
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:10,976
CAN'T YOU JUST STAY
FOR LIKE, ONE MORE HOUR?

323
00:14:11,059 --> 00:14:11,685
I REALLY HAVE TO GO.

324
00:14:11,768 --> 00:14:14,438
I'LL PAY FOR
A SECOND SESSION?

325
00:14:15,731 --> 00:14:17,691
HAVE YOU THOUGHT
ABOUT CALLING YOUR MOM?

326
00:14:17,774 --> 00:14:20,569
MAYBE SHE CAN
COME HOME EARLY.

327
00:14:20,652 --> 00:14:22,362
GOODBYE, FIONA.

328
00:14:31,079 --> 00:14:32,664
ORANGE IS...

329
00:14:35,167 --> 00:14:36,168
CAULIFLOWER.

330
00:14:37,711 --> 00:14:39,379
ONLY 34. HMM. NOT BAD.

331
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:41,590
KC:
HEY.

332
00:14:41,673 --> 00:14:43,592
OH, HEY. WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

333
00:14:43,675 --> 00:14:45,594
COACH HAS US WORKING
OUT SIX DAYS A WEEK.

334
00:14:45,677 --> 00:14:46,470
I'VE NEVER SEEN YOU
HERE BEFORE.

335
00:14:46,553 --> 00:14:49,097
OH, JUST TRYING TO LOOK
MY BEST FOR THE CALENDAR.

336
00:14:49,181 --> 00:14:50,891
COOL.

337
00:14:50,974 --> 00:14:52,643
WANNA SPOT ME?

338
00:14:55,687 --> 00:14:59,942
WAIT- 120 CALORIES!
IS THIS THING BROKEN?

339
00:15:00,025 --> 00:15:01,151
HOW LONG WERE YOU ON?

340
00:15:01,235 --> 00:15:02,819
LIKE 15 MINUTES!

341
00:15:02,903 --> 00:15:03,654
SOUNDS ABOUT RIGHT.

342
00:15:03,737 --> 00:15:05,781
BUT A BANANA'S
120 CALORIES!

343
00:15:05,864 --> 00:15:08,909
YEAH. BURNING
CALORIES IS HARD.

344
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:15,874
