STARTING QUARTERBACK
HAS TO BE PROPERLY HYDRATED.

530
00:21:01,345 --> 00:21:02,679
ARMSTRONG LET YOU STAY?

531
00:21:02,763 --> 00:21:04,723
TO WATCH,
NOT TO PLAY.

532
00:21:04,806 --> 00:21:07,559
AND I GOT A FIVE GAME
SUSPENSION.

533
00:21:07,643 --> 00:21:09,645
YOU KNOW, I'M SORRY THE WAY
THINGS TURNED OUT.

534
00:21:09,728 --> 00:21:11,021
NO, YOU'RE NOT.

535
00:21:12,022 --> 00:21:14,650
ANY CHANCES, UH,
YOU CAN HELP ME RUN SOME PLAYS?

536
00:21:14,733 --> 00:21:16,109
ARE YOU DREAMING?

537
00:21:16,193 --> 00:21:17,778
WHAT ELSE ARE YOU GONNA DO,
SITTING ON THE SIDELINES

538
00:21:17,861 --> 00:21:19,029
FOR THE NEXT FIVE GAMES?

539
00:21:19,112 --> 00:21:20,447
I'M COUNTING DOWN
EVERY MINUTE

540
00:21:20,531 --> 00:21:21,782
UNTIL I COME BACK.

THAT SHOULD BE YOU OUT THERE.

544
00:21:31,375 --> 00:21:33,961
OR, AT LEAST,
THE FOOTBALL YOU.

545
00:21:34,044 --> 00:21:37,339
HOPE SOMEDAY
IT CAN BE ALL OF ME.

I WANNA SEE SOME HUSTLE!
