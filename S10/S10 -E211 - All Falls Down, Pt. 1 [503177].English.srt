1
00:00:01,585 --> 00:00:04,087
DON'T BE LONESOME TONIGHT!

2
00:00:04,171 --> 00:00:05,923
GET YOUR TICKETS
TO "A NIGHT IN VEGAS"

3
00:00:06,006 --> 00:00:08,091
SO THAT YOU CAN HIT
THE BLACKJACK TABLE

4
00:00:08,175 --> 00:00:11,178
AFTER YOU'RE DONE
HITTING THE BOOKS.

5
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:15,516
DREW:
OKAY, ALL I HAVE TO DO
IS SUBTRACT THREE

6
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:16,767
FROM THE LEFT SIDE
OF THE EQUATION,

7
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:18,685
AND THEN SOLVE FOR X.

8
00:00:18,769 --> 00:00:22,439
UM...MAYBE WE CAN START
WITH AN EASIER QUESTION?

9
00:00:22,523 --> 00:00:24,191
OR ACCEPT
I'M GOING TO FAIL.

10
00:00:24,274 --> 00:00:25,609
YOU CAN DO THIS!

11
00:00:25,692 --> 00:00:27,486
YOU JUST HAVE TO FOCUS.

12
00:00:27,569 --> 00:00:28,862
ON SOMETHING ELSE.

13
00:00:29,863 --> 00:00:30,864
ONE KISS.

14
00:00:32,449 --> 00:00:33,700
(DOOR SLAMS)

15
00:00:34,701 --> 00:00:36,620
AUDRA:
(CLEARS THROAT)

16
00:00:36,703 --> 00:00:37,704
OH.

17
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:43,627
WELL, I'M ASSUMING THIS IS WHY
YOU'RE FAILING MATH?

18
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:45,087
MOM, WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

19
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:46,964
EMERGENCY SCHOOL BOARD MEETING.

20
00:00:47,047 --> 00:00:49,591
I THOUGHT YOU CAME EARLY
TO STUDY.

21
00:00:49,675 --> 00:00:51,260
ALLI AND I WERE JUST
TAKING A BREAK.

22
00:00:51,343 --> 00:00:52,469
UH-HUH.

23
00:00:52,553 --> 00:00:54,429
UM, NICE TO MEET YOU,
MRS. TORRES.

24
00:00:54,513 --> 00:00:57,474
YOU KNOW, THAT STINK BOMB
GAVE YOU AN EXTRA DAY TO STUDY.

25
00:00:58,475 --> 00:00:59,476
DON'T WASTE IT.

26
00:01:00,477 --> 00:01:01,854
MM-HMM.

27
00:01:01,937 --> 00:01:02,938
GREAT.

28
00:01:03,021 --> 00:01:05,023
NOW YOUR MOM THINKS
I'M SOME SKANK LIKE BIANCA

29
00:01:05,107 --> 00:01:07,568
WHO MAKES OUT WITH
A DIFFERENT GUY EVERY WEEK.

30
00:01:07,651 --> 00:01:08,986
NO, SHE DOESN'T.

31
00:01:09,695 --> 00:01:12,406
SHE JUST CAN'T ACCEPT
I SUCK AT SCHOOL.

32
00:01:12,489 --> 00:01:13,657
SO, WHERE WERE WE?

33
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:16,326
ABOUT TO CONQUER
QUADRATICS.
(FRUSTRATED SIGH)

34
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:19,496
I WON'T BE THE REASON
YOU BOMB THIS EXAM.

35
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:20,664
YOU WON'T BE.

LOOKS LIKE YOU LOST
THAT LOVING FEELING.

52
00:02:12,633 --> 00:02:13,800
HOLLY J:
YEAH. SIMPSON'S STILL IN THERE,

53
00:02:13,884 --> 00:02:15,636
WITH THE WOMAN
FROM THE SCHOOL BOARD.

54
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:19,139
YOU DON'T THINK
THEY'LL CANCEL VEGAS NIGHT

55
00:02:19,223 --> 00:02:21,517
'CAUSE SOME JERK SET OFF
A STINK BOMB, RIGHT?

56
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:22,726
POSSIBLY.

57
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:24,645
THEY HAD TO EVACUATE
THE ENTIRE SCHOOL,

58
00:02:24,728 --> 00:02:26,688
RESCHEDULE EXAMS...

59
00:02:27,689 --> 00:02:29,024
MR. SIMPSON:
(EXASPERATED SIGH)
MRS. TORRES,

60
00:02:29,107 --> 00:02:30,776
I ASSURE YOU, ONCE WE FIND
THE STUDENTS RESPONSIBLE,

61
00:02:30,859 --> 00:02:31,777
THEY WILL BE PUNISHED!

62
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:33,320
(LAUGHS) YEAH.

63
00:02:33,403 --> 00:02:34,571
I KNOW,
WITH THE SAME SEVERITY

64
00:02:34,655 --> 00:02:37,908
AS THE BOYS
WHO HAZED MY SON, RIGHT?

65
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:41,161
DEGRASSI'S ON
OUR SCHOOL BOARD'S WATCH LIST.

66
00:02:41,245 --> 00:02:42,913
BULLYING,
LOW TEST SCORES,

67
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:43,914
AND NOW A PRANK

68
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:47,793
THAT CAUSED MY SONS
TO MISS AN EXAM.

69
00:02:47,876 --> 00:02:48,794
ONE MORE INCIDENT

70
00:02:48,877 --> 00:02:51,338
AND THAT COULD BE
ANOTHER PRINCIPAL'S PROBLEM.

71
00:02:53,674 --> 00:02:54,675
HMPH!

72
00:02:55,926 --> 00:02:57,886
WELL, THE SCHOOL BOARD'S
RECOMMENDED

73
00:02:57,970 --> 00:02:59,388
THAT I CANCEL YOUR VEGAS NIGHT.

74
00:02:59,471 --> 00:03:01,682
SAV:
SIR, WE'VE ALREADY PAID
FOR THE EQUIPMENT.

75
00:03:01,765 --> 00:03:02,683
HOLLY J:
IF WE DROP THE AXE NOW,

76
00:03:02,766 --> 00:03:04,601
COUNCIL WILL BE IN THE RED
FOR YEARS.

77
00:03:04,685 --> 00:03:06,478
PLUS IT'S UNFAIR TO PUNISH
THE ENTIRE SCHOOL

78
00:03:06,562 --> 00:03:07,479
BECAUSE OF ONE BAD APPLE.

79
00:03:07,563 --> 00:03:09,523
HOLLY J:
EXACTLY! THAT WOULD BE
THE OPPOSITE OF FAIR.

80
00:03:09,606 --> 00:03:10,649
MM-HMM.

81
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:13,527
WAIT, DOES THIS MEAN
YOU'RE ON OUR SIDE?

82
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:15,153
MR. SIMPSON:
I WANT YOU TO DOUBLE
THE AMOUNT OF CHAPERONES,

83
00:03:15,237 --> 00:03:17,155
AND IF THERE'S ANY SIGN
OF TROUBLE...

84
00:03:17,239 --> 00:03:18,824
WE'LL CONTACT YOU
IMMEDIATELY.

85
00:03:18,907 --> 00:03:20,784
MR. SIMPSON:
OKAY, I TRUST YOU TWO.

86
00:03:20,868 --> 00:03:24,121
DON'T DO ANYTHING
TO CHANGE THAT.

87
00:03:25,289 --> 00:03:26,290
HIDING FROM THE PO-PO?

88
00:03:26,373 --> 00:03:28,333
(STARTLED GASP)
I'M JUST LOOKING FOR A BOOK.

89
00:03:31,587 --> 00:03:34,256
SAVING THE WORLD
ONE STINK BOMB AT A TIME.

90
00:03:36,967 --> 00:03:38,468
I KNEW IT WAS YOU!

91
00:03:38,552 --> 00:03:40,137
SOMEONE HAD TO STOP FITZ
FROM FIGHTING ADAM!

92
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:41,138
ONE SECOND MORE

93
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:42,431
AND HE WOULD'VE KICKED
ADAM'S BUTT.

94
00:03:42,514 --> 00:03:44,391
I WAS THE ONE
HE WAS GOING TO KILL!

95
00:03:46,101 --> 00:03:47,060
(GASPS)
SIMPSON'S COMING OVER.

96
00:03:47,144 --> 00:03:48,228
HE KNOWS I DID IT.

97
00:03:48,312 --> 00:03:49,229
I'M GONNA GET EXPELLED!

98
00:03:49,313 --> 00:03:50,856
THREE DAY SUSPENSION,
MAX,

99
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:51,857
AND ONLY IF YOU GET CAUGHT.

100
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:53,025
MAYBE I SHOULD JUST CONFESS,

101
00:03:53,108 --> 00:03:55,485
THROW MYSELF AT HIS MERCY.

102
00:03:55,569 --> 00:03:57,863
OR LET ME HANDLE IT.

103
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:00,490
SIR,
I HATE TO BE A RAT,

104
00:04:00,574 --> 00:04:02,451
BUT I THINK YOU SHOULD QUESTION
MARK FITZGERALD

105
00:04:02,534 --> 00:04:03,952
ABOUT THE STINK BOMB.

106
00:04:04,036 --> 00:04:05,913
HEARD HIM BRAGGING ABOUT IT.

107
00:04:06,914 --> 00:04:08,332
CLARE, IS THIS TRUE?

108
00:04:08,415 --> 00:04:09,416
UH, POSSIBLY.

109
00:04:12,503 --> 00:04:13,837
OKAY.

110
00:04:13,921 --> 00:04:15,923
I'LL LOOK INTO IT.

111
00:04:18,133 --> 00:04:19,384
JUSTICE HAS BEEN SERVED.

112
00:04:19,468 --> 00:04:20,427
IF FITZ FINDS OUT?

113
00:04:20,511 --> 00:04:22,221
I'LL HANDLE IT.

114
00:04:22,304 --> 00:04:23,889
NOW, LET'S TALK ABOUT
SOMETHING MORE IMPORTANT,

115
00:04:23,972 --> 00:04:26,016
LIKE HOW YOU'RE GONNA
THANK ME

116
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:27,434
FOR THROWING SIMPSON
OFF YOUR SCENT?

117
00:04:27,518 --> 00:04:29,102
WHAT DID YOU HAVE
IN MIND?

118
00:04:29,186 --> 00:04:30,979
WELL, I DON'T KNOW.

119
00:04:31,063 --> 00:04:32,064
(GASPS)

120
00:04:39,154 --> 00:04:40,822
I HAVE A FRENCH EXAM.

121
00:04:40,906 --> 00:04:42,741
I THINK YOU JUST PASSED IT.

122
00:04:49,498 --> 00:04:50,415
OKAY, SO FOR THIS ONE,

123
00:04:50,499 --> 00:04:52,417
YOU JUST DIVIDE BOTH SIDES
OF THE EQUATION BY THREE,

124
00:04:52,501 --> 00:04:54,044
AND THAT WAY,
YOU'VE ISOLATED THE VARIABLE.

125
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:55,045
SIMPLE, RIGHT?

126
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:56,046
KC:
UM, QUADRATICS.

127
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:58,215
SO QUADRATICS,
JUST REMEMBER THAT AX SQUARED

128
00:04:58,298 --> 00:05:00,050
PLUS BX PLUS C
EQUALS ZERO.

129
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:01,009
THAT'S WHAT IT SHOULD
LOOK LIKE.

130
00:05:01,093 --> 00:05:02,010
FROM THERE,
YOU'RE GONNA GO AHEAD

131
00:05:02,094 --> 00:05:03,929
AND DO YOUR OWN THING.

132
00:05:04,012 --> 00:05:05,430
YOU GOT IT?

133
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:09,393
OW! WHAT? SORRY?

134
00:05:09,476 --> 00:05:10,561
DUDE, THE EXAM'S
IN TWO HOURS,

135
00:05:10,644 --> 00:05:11,562
YOU HAVE TO LEARN THIS!

136
00:05:11,645 --> 00:05:12,938
NO, BELIEVE ME,
I-I'VE TRIED.

137
00:05:13,021 --> 00:05:14,606
I DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHY MY MOM FORCES ME

138
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:16,066
TO TAKE UNIVERSITY TRACK MATH,

139
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:18,151
WHEN I CAN BARELY HANDLE
LONG DIVISION!

140
00:05:22,197 --> 00:05:24,366
BIANCA:
I HAVE A PROBLEM
YOU COULD SOLVE.

141
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:27,202
THE ZIPPER ON MY HOODIE'S
STUCK.

142
00:05:27,286 --> 00:05:28,203
(LAUGHS UNCOMFORTABLY)

143
00:05:28,287 --> 00:05:29,830
I GUESS I COULD TAKE A LOOK.

144
00:05:37,171 --> 00:05:40,048
HOW CAN I EVER
THANK YOU?

145
00:05:40,132 --> 00:05:42,050
I'M UH...
I'M SURE YOU'LL FIND A WAY.

146
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,684
(EXHALES NOISILY)

147
00:05:51,685 --> 00:05:52,603
(KC LAUGHS)

148
00:05:52,686 --> 00:05:54,062
WHAT, WHAT?
WE WERE JUST TALKING.

149
00:05:54,146 --> 00:05:56,481
YEAH?
IT LOOKED MORE LIKE FLIRTING.

150
00:05:56,565 --> 00:05:57,566
(LAUGHS)

151
00:05:58,734 --> 00:06:00,652
MS. OH:
YOU WILL HAVE EXACTLY
TWO HOURS

152
00:06:00,736 --> 00:06:02,487
TO COMPLETE THE EXAM.

153
00:06:02,571 --> 00:06:05,073
EXAMS ARE IN THREE SECTIONS.

154
00:06:05,157 --> 00:06:07,451
SO, HOW MUCH TONGUE
WAS INVOLVED?

155
00:06:07,534 --> 00:06:09,119
ALLI, THAT IS NONE
OF YOUR BUSINESS!

156
00:06:09,203 --> 00:06:10,954
WHAT? IF YOU WANT ME
TO ANALYZE THE SITUATION,

157
00:06:11,038 --> 00:06:12,122
I'M GONNA NEED DETAILS.

158
00:06:12,206 --> 00:06:13,332
WELL, YOU'RE NOT GETTING
THAT ONE.

159
00:06:13,415 --> 00:06:14,750
JUST TELL ME
IF YOU THINK THAT MEANS

160
00:06:14,833 --> 00:06:16,960
ELI'S OVER
HIS DEAD EX-GIRLFRIEND.

161
00:06:17,044 --> 00:06:19,546
WELL, GIVEN THE LIMITED
INFORMATION YOU'VE PROVIDED,

162
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:20,964
THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY
TO FIND OUT.

163
00:06:21,048 --> 00:06:22,466
I PROMISED
I WOULDN'T PUSH.

164
00:06:22,549 --> 00:06:23,884
CLARE, YOU HAVE
NO OTHER OPTION.

165
00:06:23,967 --> 00:06:24,885
IN 24 HOURS,

166
00:06:24,968 --> 00:06:26,803
YOU GO TO YOUR GRANDMA'S HOUSE
FOR A BREAK.

167
00:06:26,887 --> 00:06:29,014
DO YOU KNOW WHAT COULD HAPPEN
IN TWO WEEKS?

168
00:06:29,097 --> 00:06:31,558
ELI COULD MEET SOME CUTE GIRL
AT THE CAR WASH.

169
00:06:31,642 --> 00:06:34,144
SHE ASKS IF HE'S TAKEN,
HE'S NOT SURE.

170
00:06:34,228 --> 00:06:35,604
NEXT THING YOU KNOW,
THOSE TWO ARE MAKING OUT

171
00:06:35,687 --> 00:06:37,981
DURING THE HOT WAX CYCLE.

172
00:06:38,065 --> 00:06:39,233
HE SAID HE NEEDED TIME.

173
00:06:39,316 --> 00:06:41,735
THAT GIRL AT THE CAR WASH
DOES NOT CARE!

174
00:06:41,818 --> 00:06:43,070
SHE'S RUTHLESS.

175
00:06:44,071 --> 00:06:45,656
(SIGHS)

176
00:06:45,739 --> 00:06:48,075
