WHERE'S YOUR SISTER?

2
00:00:05,631 --> 00:00:06,673
IS SHE UP?

3
00:00:06,757 --> 00:00:08,175

I HAVEN'T SEEN HER.

4
00:00:08,258 --> 00:00:10,886
MRS. BHANDARI:
SHE'S SUSPENDED FROM SCHOOL
AND SHE'S SLEEPING IN?

5
00:00:10,969 --> 00:00:11,970
UNACCEPTABLE.

6
00:00:13,847 --> 00:00:15,182

SHE'S PROBABLY SULKING.

7
00:00:15,265 --> 00:00:16,225

LAST NIGHT.

8
00:00:16,308 --> 00:00:18,644
MR. BHANDARI:
WHAT ABOUT?

9
00:00:18,727 --> 00:00:21,271
OH, I NEED A DRUMMER
FOR MY UNIVERSITY MUSIC DEMO,

10
00:00:21,355 --> 00:00:22,731
AND THE ONLY GOOD DRUMMER
I COULD FIND

11
00:00:22,814 --> 00:00:23,815
IS SOMEONE SHE HATES.

12
00:00:23,899 --> 00:00:26,068
SO SHE WANTS ME
TO GET RID OF HIM.

13
00:00:26,151 --> 00:00:27,069
AND JEOPARDIZE YOUR CHANCES

14
00:00:27,152 --> 00:00:29,196

INTO UNIVERSITY?

15
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:31,031

16
00:00:31,114 --> 00:00:32,616

AS IT IS.

17
00:00:32,699 --> 00:00:34,743
MR. BHANDARI:

18
00:00:34,826 --> 00:00:36,036

THIS DRUMMER?

19
00:00:36,119 --> 00:00:37,120

20
00:00:37,204 --> 00:00:38,914

TO GET OVER IT.

21
00:00:38,997 --> 00:00:40,165
